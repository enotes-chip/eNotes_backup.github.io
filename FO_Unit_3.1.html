                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>MODE OF SETTLEMENT OF BILLS
</strong><br>Generally, hotels determine the mode of settling the guest accounts at the time of registration or sometimes even at the time of receiving the reservation request This makes it very convenient for the front desk employee to prepare the guest bill at the time of check-out. There are several acceptable modes of payment—foreign currency, traveler’s cheque, demand draft, debit card, credit card, and so on.
<br>
<br><strong>Foreign Exchange
</strong><br>The tourism and hospitality industry is among the major foreign exchange earners for any nation, All the foreign visitors in a hotel can settle their accounts in the currency of their country dollar, Euro, Pound, etc. except guests who are employed with the UN and its agencies, embassies, consulates, and high commissions. Even if the guests have already converted their currency into Indian currency, they still have to pay the room rent in foreign currency.
<br>Hotels have to take a valid license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with foreign exchange. RBI issues two types of licenses to deal with foreign exchange-—-one for the purchase and one for the sale of the foreign currency. A hotel with the purchase license can only purchase foreign currency, which means that the hotel can accept foreign currency from the guest, but the refund amount exceeding the billing amount will only be made in Indian currency. Hotels generally
<br>obtain the purchase license; but if a hotel has obtained the license for buying and selling foreign currency, it can buy and sell foreign currency, i-e., accept foreign currency and give the balance amount also in foreign currency.
<br><br><strong>Currency Exchange Procedure</strong> To deal in foreign exchange, a hotel has to take a valid license from RBI. The front office cashier is the hotel’s authorized representative for foreign exchange dealing. When guests wish to exchange the currency of their country into Indian currency, the following procedure is followed:
<br>
<br>1. The guest contacts the front desk cashier for foreign exchange.
<br>2. The cashier requests the guest to produce his passport to verify his identity.
<br>3. The cashier asks the guest for the amount of foreign currency to be exchanged and determines whether the amount is exchangeable as per the RBI guidelines.
<br>4. The cashier checks the exchange rate from RBI or a leading nationalized bank of the town.
<br>5. The cashier prepares the currency exchange certificate.
<br>6. The cashier requests the guest to sign the currency exchange certificate.
<br>7. The guest gives the foreign currency to the cashier in cash or as a traveler’s cheque.
<br>8. The cashier calculates the total amount to be paid in local currency as per the exchange rate.
<br>9. The cashier dispenses the amount to the guest along with the original currency encashment certificate. He attaches the second copy with the foreign currency or traveler’s cheques and leaves the stationary copy in the booklet.
<br>10. The cashier fills the details of the daily currency exchange transactions in the foreign currency control sheet.
<br>11. If the cashier receives the foreign currency at the time of settlement of bis the same procedure is applied, and the balance, if any, is returned to the guest in local currency.
<br>
<br>The above-mentioned procedure is followed by hotels with the license for purchasing foreign currency. In case the hotel also has the license to sell foreign currency, then in step 11, the cashier returns the balance amount in the foreign currency.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br><strong>Cash Settlement</strong> 
<br>The cash payment option is one of the most preferred modes of settlement of guest accounts. At the time of settlement, the cashier zeroes the balance in the guest account. If there is a credit balance in the guest folio, the hotel will pay back the balance amount to the guest to make the balance zero. Whereas, if there is a debit balance in the guest’s folio, the hotel will collect the balance amount from the guest to make the folio balance zero. The various modes of account settlement by cash: 
<br>● Currency Notes 
<br>1. Foreign Currency 
<br>2. Local Currency 
<br>● Traveler’s Cheque 
<br>● Personal Cheque 
<br>● Demand Draft 
<br>● Debit Card 
<br>
<br><strong>Currency Notes</strong> Guests can settle their accounts by paying through currency notes. This is one of the most widely accepted modes of account settlement. While accepting currency notes, the cashier should check if the currency notes are genuine. 
<br>The following procedure is generally adopted for accepting cash payments: 
<br>● If accepting foreign currency from the guest, the cashier checks the daily currency conversion rate. 
<br>● To avoid any disputes, the cashier should retain the cash amount outside the cash drawer till the transaction is completed. 
<br>● The cashier should count the value of the currency in front of the guest. 
<br>● If accepting foreign currency from the guest, the cashier makes the currency encashment certificate. 
<br>● The cashier issues a receipt for the transaction. 
<br>● As per Government regulations, the cashier should accept foreign currency only from foreigners and return the balance amount, if any, in local currency. 
<br>
<br><strong>Traveller's Cheque</strong> A traveler’s cheque or TC is an internationally accepted cheque for a sum in a specific currency that can be exchanged elsewhere for local currency or goods. It is also among the most widely accepted modes of account settlement. Issued by a financial institution, it functions as cash but is protected against loss or theft. The value of the traveler’s cheque is written on it. Traveler’s cheques are useful when traveling, especially in the case of overseas travel when all the credit and debit cards are not accepted. When a person exchanges traveler’s cheques for cash, she usually incurs a charge or commission, though some banks wave off this charge. 
<br>
<br>The purchaser of the traveler’s cheque puts two signatures—one in front of the issuing authority and the second in front of the encashing authority. To prevent misuse, the loss of a traveler’s cheque should be immediately reported to the issuing bank and local police authority. 
<br>
<br>While accepting a traveler’s cheque from a guest for the settlement of bills, the front desk cashier should proceed as follows: 
<br>● Ensure that the second signature is put in front of him. 
<br>● Check the guest’s passport to establish identity. 
<br>● Note down the passport number at the back of the traveler’s cheque. 
<br>● If the traveler’s cheque is in foreign currency, calculate the correct exchange value as per the daily rate. 
<br>● Return the balance to the guest in local currency. 
<br>
<br><strong>Personal Cheque</strong> Personal cheques are cheques drawn against funds deposited in an individual’s bank account. It takes some time before the payment for the cheque is received from the issuing bank. There is also a chance of the bank refusing a payment—if there is an insufficient amount in the account or if the guest has ‘stopped’ the cheque. Hence, it is normally not an accepted mode of account settlement. However, hotels may accept personal cheques from frequent guests or guests from companies that give a high volume of business to the hotel. 
<br>In case a guest insists on settling his bill by personal cheque, the front desk agent may politely request him to get authorization from the lobby manager. On receiving authorization from the lobby manager, the guest has to submit an application for making payment by personal cheque. The front office agent needs to check the following details: 
<br>
<br>● The signatures in the application form and the cheque match. 
<br>● The cheque is crossed as ‘A/c Payee only. 
<br>● The amount in figures and words is the same. 
<br>● The date on the cheque is valid. 
<br>● Accept only MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Reader) cheques. 
<br>● Do not accept second or third party cheques. 
<br>
<br><strong>Demand Draft </strong>A demand draft is a written order from the bank for the payment of money upon presentation of the same. A person may obtain a demand draft from a bank by filling the required form and paying the draft amount and the bank's commission. It is a secure and widely accepted mode of payment. <br>
<br><strong>Debit Card</strong> A debit card is a card (usually plastic) that allows customers to access their funds immediately, electronically. It enables the holder to withdraw money or to have the cost of purchases charged directly to her bank account without paying by cash or writing a cheque. In many countries, it also acts as an ATM card, which is used to withdraw money from ATMs (automated teller machines). It is a safe mode of account settlement as the amount is instantly transferred to the hotel’s account. When the card is swiped, the electronic fund transfer point of sale (EFTPOS) terminal contacts the computer network of the bank to verify and authorize the transaction. Once the authorization is received from the bank, the amount is debited from the guest’s bank account and instantly credited to the hotel’s bank account. In case of insufficient funds, the bank does not authorize the transaction and the guest has requested an alternative mode of payment. 
<br>
<br><strong>Credit Settlement 
</strong><br>A credit settlement is an arrangement for the deferred payment of goods and services, i.e., a settlement in which the hotel does not receive any payment on the day of departure of the guest but would receive it later. The various credit modes <br>
<br>1. Credit Card/Charge 
<br>2. Travel Agent Voucher 
<br>3. Corporate Billing/Bill to Company (BTC) Letter 
<br>
<br><strong>Credit Card/Charge Card Payments</strong> A credit card is a payment card (usually plastic) that allows the owner to obtain goods and services on credit terms, without paying cash. It may be used repeatedly to borrow money or buy goods and services on credit. In addition to obtaining goods, credit cards can also be used to obtain cash. The issuer (bank) assures the seller (hotel) that the owner (guest) has a satisfactory credit rating and that the bank will see to it that the hotel receives payment for the merchandise delivered. Transactions during a month are totaled and presented to the cardholder for settlement on a monthly basis. Alternatively, a percentage of the outstanding amount can be paid and the balance extended to the next month and so on. This will normally incur a much higher annual rate of interest than usual; for example, a 2 percent monthly interest rate is equivalent to the annual percentage rate of 26.82 percent. 
<br>It is among the most favored modes of account settlement. It is much more convenient for the traveler to carry credit card(s) than carrying cash. Most of the hotels accept major credit cards. 
<br>
<br>A <em>charge card</em> is a plastic payment card that enables the holder to obtain goods and services without the requirement to pay cash. The account statement is sent to the cardholder every month and must be settled in full. Unlike a credit card, the balance in the charge card account cannot be rolled over from one billing to the next. In addition to obtaining goods, the charge card can be used to obtain cash. Some examples of charge cards are American Express, Diners Club, and a number 
<br>of gold cards. While processing payment through credit cards, the front desk cashier follows 
<br>the following procedure: 
<br>● Checks the card holder's name on the card. 
<br>● Checks the expiry date of the card. 
<br>● Checks if the card is a stolen card. 
<br>● Checks the credit limit of the card; if the amount of the bill exceeds the limit of the credit card, the cashier requests the guest to pay the balance amount by cash. 
<br>● Swipes the card through the EFTPOS terminal for verification and authorization from the issuer of the credit card. 
<br>● Asks the guest to sign on the transaction slip. 
<br>● Verifies the guest’s signature on the transaction slip with the signature on the signature panel at the reverse of the card. 
<br>● Returns the credit card and the carbon copy of the transaction slip to the guest. 
<br>● Follows the standard operation procedure to process the payment of the guest folio as per the house customs. 
<br>
<br><strong>Travel Agent Vouchers</strong> Tour operators and travel agencies selling packages or customized tours make bookings for a guest’s accommodation, food and beverage, and other services. Mostly, they receive the advance payment from travelers at the time of selling the tour package itself. The travel agency (TA) sends a voucher to the service provider (hotel) with the details of the billing procedure 
<br>(direct payment by the guest or bill to TA) and the services (room and meal plan) to be provided to the traveler. Apart from travel agencies and tour operators, airlines (that have contracts with hotels) also send meals and accommodation orders (MAO) or passenger service orders (PSO) to layover passengers in case of flight delays and cancellations. In such cases, the hotel obtains payments from the TA or the airline. 
<br>While processing the TA voucher/MAO/PSO, the front desk cashier should proceed as follows: 
<br>● Read the vouchers carefully. 
<br>● Refer to the list of approved TAs to whom the hotel offers credit. 
<br>● Check the billing instructions carefully. 
<br>● In the case of a foreign travel agency’s voucher, get authorization from the lobby manager. 
<br>● Check the expenses covered by the voucher. 
<br>● Collect payment from the guest for the services not covered or included in the voucher; for example, bills for spa treatments. 
<br>● Attach all the vouchers signed by the guest with the master bill, and ask the guest to verify and sign the bill. 
<br>● Do not give the copies of signed bills to the guest (as these have to be presented to the travel agent, who will make the payment to the hotel in this case). 
<br>● Send the guest bill and vouchers to the accounts department for the collection of the amount from the travel agent. 
<br>
<br><strong>Corporate Billing or Bill to Company lette</strong>r Some companies, whose executives travel at the expense of the company, make a deal with hotels, whereby they determine the rates for different types of rooms and meal plans to be offered to their executives. The terms and conditions of the payment are also pre-determined. 
<br>The reservations are made by the company on behalf of the traveling executives. The executives carry a letter from their company, which is called a bill to company (BTC) letter, as proof of their identity. 
<br>The front desk cashier proceeds as follows while processing BTC letters: 
<br>● Establishes the identity of the guest by asking him to show his identity card or/and the BTC letter, which is prepared on the company letterhead. 
<br>● Checks and verifies that the company is listed in the company volume guarantee rate (CVGR) list of the hotel. 
<br>● Checks the services that are included in the agreement with the company any service or facility utilized by the guest that is not covered by the company should be charged separately from the guest. 
<br>● Prepares the guest bill, along with all the supporting vouchers, and asks the guest to verify and sign the bill. 
<br>● Do not give the bill to the guest (as these have to be given to the company, which will make the payment to the hotel). 
<br>● Sends the duly signed bill to the accounts department for collection from the company. 
<br>● Sometimes guests utilize facilities and services, like telephone, laundry, and drinks, that are not covered by the TA voucher or company agreement. In such cases, the guests should settle these sundry transactions by making direct payment to the hotel.&nbsp;<br></p>
