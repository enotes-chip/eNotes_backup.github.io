</strong><br>
<br>A voucher details a transaction to be posted to a front office account. This document lists detailed transaction information gathered at the source of the transaction. For example, hotel revenue outlets use vouchers to notify the front office of guest charge purchases, which require posting. Types of Vouchers :
<br>
<br>1. Visitors Paid-out
<br>
<br>2. Miscellaneous Charge Voucher
<br>
<br>3. Cash Receipt Voucher
<br>
<br>4. Telephone Call Voucher
<br>
<br>5. Travel Agent Voucher
<br>
<br>6. Commission Voucher
<br>
<br>7. Guest Allowances
<br>
<br>8. Restaurant/Bar Check
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>1. Visitors Paid-out </strong>The money paid by the hotel on behalf of guests is known as visitors paid-out (VPO). A VPO is generally made for the following charges:
<br>
<br>• Payment for taxi, travel agency services
<br>
<br>• Porter charges
<br>
<br>• Florist charges
<br>
<br>• Postage and courier charges
<br>
<br>• Emergency medical expenses
<br>
<br>The paid-outs are made from the cash bank that is maintained by the front office cashier. A proper authorization should be taken from the lobby manager before making the VPO. To make a paid-out, one should:
<br>
<br>• Confirm the name, room number, and identity of the guest.
<br>
<br>• Fill the paid-out voucher properly, mentioning the details of services paid for it.
<br>
<br>• Get the VPO authorized by the lobby manager.
<br>
<br>• Make the payment.
<br>
<br>• Post the entry in the guest folio and place the voucher in the folio docket.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>2. Miscellaneous Charge Voucher</strong> A miscellaneous charge voucher is prepared for the payment of miscellaneous services and facilities, like laundry, health club, fitness centre, beauty salon, etc. The guest verifies and signs the miscellaneous charge voucher, which is sent to the front desk cashier for posting the charges into the guest folio.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Cash Receipt Voucher</strong> A receipt is an acknowledgment that a payment has been made. A cash receipt voucher is prepared and issued to the person depositing cash as a proof of remittance of the deposited cash.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Telephone Call Voucher</strong> Nowadays a lot of hotels use computerized systems, where, whenever a guest makes a call, the call accounting module automatically transfers the call charges to the guest folio. In small hotels, where outgoing calls are routed through the operator, the responsibility of billing the call charges lies with the telephone operator, who puts down the call details on a telephone charge voucher and sends it to the front desk cashier for posting into the guest account.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Travel Agent Voucher</strong> Most tour operators and travel agencies receive advance payment from their clients for making travel arrangements like accommodation, food and beverage, and other services. The travel agency then makes the reservation in a hotel on behalf of the guest. It sends a voucher, known as a travel agent voucher, containing the details of the billing procedure and services to be provided to the guest. Airlines that have contracts with hotels also send meals and accommodation order (MAO) or passenger service order (PSO) for layover passengers due to delay or cancellation of flights. In these cases, the hotel obtains payments from the travel agency or airline.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Commission Voucher</strong> Hotels offer commission to persons who provide regular business to them. Whenever a commission is paid by the cashier, a commission voucher is made. The commission voucher should be authorized by a competent authority of the hotel. Generally, it is authorized by the lobby manager. More commonly, commission vouchers are made for the following:
<br>
<br>• A taxi driver who brings a walk-in guest to the hotel. In case the guest stays at the hotel, the hotel pays a commission to the taxi driver.
<br>
<br>• A travel agent/tour operator working on commission basis (generally, the commission is 10 per cent on the room rates, excluding taxes).
<br>
<br>• Any agency working on a commission basis.
<br>
<br><strong>7. Guest Allowances</strong> An allowance is an amount deducted from an invoice to compensate the buyer for an expense or mistake. The guest allowance is the cash paid to the guest by the hotel, especially in the following circumstances:
<br>
<br>• If there is a wrong posting of a charge in the guest folio, an allowance is given and the voucher is made to nullify the guest folio balance due to the wrong posting.
<br>
<br>• If a guest has deposited a large sum as advance and that amount exceeds the hotel bill.
<br>
<br>• If an airline or a tour operator sends a crew or a group and guarantees the reimbursement of their bills.
<br>
<br>Guest allowances are strictly controlled. The front desk cashier requires an authorization from a competent authority before making such a payment.
<br>
<br><strong>8. Restaurant/Bar Check</strong> Resident guests may enjoy their meals in any of the food and beverage outlets in a hotel. Whenever a guest consumes food or beverage in a restaurant, a bill is raised; in case a resident guest wishes to utilize the credit facility offered by the hotel, he should sign the bill. The signed bills serve as the proof of financial transactions at the food and beverage outlets and are treated as vouchers for posting the charges to the guest folio
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Folios
</strong><br>
<br>Front office transactions are typically charted on account statement called folios. A folio is a statement of all transactions (debits &amp; credits) affecting the balance of a single account. When an account is created, it is assigned a folio with a starting balance of zero. All transactions which increase (debits) or decrease (credits) the balances of the account are recorded on the folio. At settlement, a guest folio should be returned to a zero balance by cash payment or by transfer to an approved credit card or direct billing account.
<br>
<br>The process of recording transactions on a folio is called posting. A transaction is posted when it has been recorded on the proper folio in the proper location and a new balance has been determined. When posting transactions, the front office may rely on hand written folios (if it is using a non-automated system), a machine-posted folios (with a semi-automated system), or computer-based electronic folios (with a fully automated system)
<br>
<br>Regardless of the posting technique used, the basic accounting information recorded on a folio remains the same. In a non-automated or semi-automated record keeping system, guest folios are maintained at the front desk. In a fully automated record keeping system, electronic folios are stored in a computer and can be retrieved, displayed, or printed on request.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>There are basically four types of folios used in front office accounting. They are:
<br>
<br><strong>• Guest folios:-</strong> accounts assigned to individual persons or guest rooms
<br>
<br><strong>• Master folios:-</strong> accounts assigned to more than one person or guest room; usually reserved for group accounts.
<br>
<br><strong>• Non-guest or semi-permanent folios:-</strong> accounts assigned to non-guest businesses or agencies with hotel charge purchase privileges.
<br>
<br><strong>• Employee folios:- </strong>accounts assigned to employees with charge purchase privileges. Executives like Sales and Marketing Director, Front Office Manager may charge the hotel for travel and entertainment to promote the business
<br>
<br>Additional types of folios are frequently created by front office management to accommodate special circumstances or requests. For e.g... A business guest may request that his or her charges and payments be split between two personal folios: one to record expenses to be paid by the sponsoring business, &amp; one to record personal expenses to be paid by the guest. This is referred to as a split folio. In this situation, two folios are created for one guest. If the room and tax portion are to be separated from other charges, the room and tax is posted to the room folio. This is sometimes called the A folio. Food, beverage, telephone, &amp; other charges are posted to the incidental folio or B folio.
<br>
<br>Every folio should have a unique serial number. Folio serial numbers are needed for many reasons. First, they serve as identification numbers that help ensure that all folios are accounted for during an audit of front office transactions. Second, folio numbers may be used to index information in automated system. Automated systems frequently create folio numbers when reservations are made. Folio numbers are then transferred to the front desk for use during registration. Finally, folio numbers can provide a chain of documentation. In non-automated &amp; semi-automated systems, folios have specific length &amp; can hold only a limited number of postings. When a balance must be carried forward to a new folio, the old folio numbers should be shown as a reference of where the balance originated.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Ledger
</strong><br>
<br>A ledger is a collection of the same type of accounts. The front office ledger has a collection of folios. There are normally two ledgers maintained by the front office. One of them, as guest ledger, contains all the folio entries of resident guests; the other contains the folio entries of non-resident guest accounts and is known as city ledger.
<br>
<br><strong>1. Guest Ledger</strong> A guest ledger contains the details of all the financial transactions between a resident guest and the hotel, including charge purchases and the payments received from the guest. It has two parts—debit and credit. By taking a  look at the guest ledger, one can find the credit or debit balance of an individual guest as well as the total credit or debit balance on date. In a manual system, the financial transactions are recorded in a tabular ledger, or tab ledger, which is of two types: 
<br>
<br><br>• Horizontal tabular ledger
<br>
<br>• Vertical tabular ledger
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>* Horizontal tabular ledger In a horizontal tabular ledger, all the credit expenses of the guest are recorded in one horizontal row, and at the end of the row, the guests' credit or debit balance is shown. The vertical row of the table contains the room numbers. At the end of vertical column, the daily sales balance can be seen.  
<br>
<br>
<br>* Visitors/Vertical tabular ledger A vertical tabular ledger is a variation of the horizontal tabular ledger. It is also called visitors tabular ledger. The rows depict the room numbers, and in the columns, the details of the guests and their credit expenses as well as payments are recorded. At the end of every column, one can find the account balance of individual guests staying in a particular room. It is a loose sheet and is prepared on a daily basis by the front desk cashier.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>2. City Ledger</strong> A city ledger contains the collective accounts of all the non-resident individuals/agencies to whom the hotel extends credit facility. It is also called non guest account. City ledgers also contain the accounts of resident guests who have left the hotel without settling their accounts, which would be settled at a later date by a third party (may be a credit card company, an airline, a travel agency, or a corporate house). This account would be closed at the time of receiving the complete payment. The account of skippers is also maintained in the city ledger for a specific period (as per the hotel policy); at the expiry of this period the same is written off as bad debt and the account is closed. This ledger also includes bad cheque accounts (cheque's that have bounced), disputed bills account (bills that are in dispute), late charges accounts (bills that could not be posted in the guest bill at the time of check-out), and retention charges accounts (reservation was guaranteed but the same was cancelled or guest did not show up
