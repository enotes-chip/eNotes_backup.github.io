</strong><br>
<br><strong>What is refrigeration?
</strong><br>Refrigeration is the science of producing and maintaining a temperature condition in a closed space lower than the surrounding ambiance by removing heat from the space and transferring that heat to another space or substance.
<br>
<br><strong>Need for refrigeration
</strong><br>• In hotels and households, food items, both cooked and uncooked, can be preserved for a long time in low temperatures.
<br>• Storage of fruits and vegetables makes it possible to add fresh salads to the menu all year round.
<br>• Storage of fish, meat and other perishables items safely for longer periods is possible due to refrigeration.
<br>• Seasonal food items can be bought from the market in bulk quantity at relatively cheaper price, stored in refrigerated conditions and later used during off season.
<br>• Cooling of desserts and drinks.
<br>
<br><strong>TERMS USED IN REFRIGERATION
</strong><br><strong>• REFRIGERANT –</strong> It is the substance used for heat transfer in a refrigeration system. It takes up heat from inside the refrigerator cabinet and releases it to the outside atmosphere.
<br><strong>• SENSIBLE HEAT – </strong>The heat which is used to raise or lower the temperature of a substance.
<br><strong>• LATENT HEAT –</strong> Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released when a substance changes its physical state. Latent heat is absorbed upon evaporation, and released upon condensation to liquid (as in clouds).
<br><strong>• EVAPORATION –</strong> It is the process of a substance in a liquid state changing to a gaseous state due to an increase in temperature and/or pressure.
<br><strong>• CONDENSATION -</strong> It is the change of the physical state of matter from gas phase into liquid phase, and is the reverse of evaporation.
<br><strong>• ONE TON OF REFRIGERATION –</strong> It means cooling by extracting heat at the rate of 50Kcal/minute or 3000 Kcal/hr.

</strong><br>• It should be non poisonous and non irritant.
<br>• It should be non flammable.
<br>• It should be chemically stable.
<br>• It should be non corrosive and should not react with the parts / components of the system.
<br>• It should have no objectionable odour or smell.
<br>• It should be easily and reliably detectable in case of leakage.
<br>• Its LH of vapourisation should be high so that quantity of high refrigerant can be minimized.
<br>• Its cost should be low.
<br>• It should be easily available.
<br>
<br><strong>REFRIGERATION PROCESS</strong>
<br>The main components of a refrigeration process are:
<br>1. Evaporator
<br>2. Compressor
<br>3. Condenser
<br>4. Expansion Valve
<br>
<br><strong>EVAPORATOR:</strong> In the evaporator the Refrigerant absorbs the heat from the object to be cooled and itself gets heated up. The heat absorbed is the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid refrigerant and therefore the refrigerant undergoes a change of state i.e. from liquid to vapours without any change in temperature. The vapour refrigerant then returns to the compressor.
<br>
<br><strong>COMPRESSOR:</strong> The vapour refrigerant is compressed at a very high pressure and temperature. It then passes through the condenser coil.
<br>
<br><strong>CONDENSER:</strong> While passing through the condenser the refrigerant rejects heat either to air or to surrounding water which gets heated up. The refrigerant condenses to a cold liquid state but at high pressure. This high pressure colder refrigerant then passes through the expansion valve.
<br>
<br><strong>EXPANSION VALVE:</strong> The expansion valve cools down the refrigerant to a low temperature and also reduces the pressure. It can be adjusted to control the temperature and pressure to which the refrigerant goes to the evaporator. The cool refrigerant is now ready to absorb heat from the hot objects while passing through the evaporator.
<br>* Efficiency of Refrigeration System is expressed as Coefficient of Performance (COP) and is
defined as the ratio of refrigeration effect produced to the mechanical work done.
<br>
<strong><br>TYPES OF REFRIGERATING UNITS IN HOTEL INDUSTRY
</strong><br>The usual categories of refrigerating units employed in the hotel industry are:
<br>• Reach – in Units
<br>• Counter – top or table – top Units
<br>• Walk – in Units
<br>• Special – purpose Units
<br>
<br>Each of the above mentioned units can have both cooler and freezer sections in them. Some refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food. They are as follows:
<br>• Subzero (up to - 18 degree Celsius) - Freezer Section
<br>• 0 degree Celsius - Meat preservation Section
<br>• 5 degree Celsius - Refrigerator
<br>• 10 degree Celsius - Vegetables Section
<br>
<br><strong>Reach – in refrigerators
</strong><br>Coolers &amp; Freezers – Capacities of such units are usually expressed in terms of the internal space volume (cubic metre) or in mass (Kg) of material being stored in it. Typical interior temperature range for cooler should be 4.4 degree Celsius to 7 degree Celsius and for a freezer should be -15 degree Celsius to -23 degree Celsius.
<br>
<br><strong>Counter top units
</strong><br>Small counter top refrigerators are frequently used to facilitate service. They are usually coolers and have features similar to those of reach-in coolers but of much smaller size usually up to a size of 100 litres only.
<br>
<br><strong>Walk – in refrigeration system
</strong><br>As the name suggests, food operators can directly move into such units. They are much bigger in size and height than walk – in refrigerators. A typical size would be 4 X 5 X 3 m, or even more, or as less as having a floor area of 2 sq.m. They are normally custom built
<br>
<strong><br>Special purpose units
</strong><br>•&nbsp;<strong><em>Ice Cream Conservator and frozen food conservator: </em></strong>They are usually “well type” and open vertically through a lid. This minimizes heat loss as cool and heavy air inside cannot escape upward. They are usually maintained at temperatures between -23 to -18 degree Celsius.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong><em>Wet Fish Cabinets:</em></strong> They contain deep galvanized drawers in which fish can be embedded in ice. They keep moist storage conditions necessary for maintaining the quality of fish. They are usually maintained at temperatures between 0 to -2 degree Celsius.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong><em>Display Cabinets:</em></strong> In many hotels, there is a refrigerated display cabinet kept in the dinning for the customers to choose varieties of meats for grilling. They are also used to display bakery products and desserts.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong><em>Bottle Coolers:</em></strong> They are used in dining and are usually in bars. They are constructed in two ways. One is open refrigerated through type and the other is glass front cabinet type with hinged doors or sliding doors.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Ice makers:</strong> Modern ice making machines need only to be connected to a cold water supply line. Water flows over a refrigerated plate and gets converted into a slab of ice. This slab of ice passes over a wire net which is electrically heated and the slab melts along the wire mesh and falls through the square holes as separate small cubes of ice.
<br>
<br><strong>CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF REFRIGERATING UNITS
</strong><br>Regular cleaning and maintenance not only makes your equipment work more efficiently, but it also helps it last longer. When parts are worn and dirty, the unit runs more frequently causing more wear and tear on the parts. Eventually, the unit breaks down for good long before it should have. Preventing these issues is simpler than you think. Call in a qualified refrigeration service company at least twice a year and up to once a month, depending on the load and usage of your equipment, to do the following tasks:
<br>
<br><strong>• </strong>Clean evaporator and condenser coils
<br>• Check lines for condensation
<br>• Clean fan blades and inspect the fan motor
<br>• Check integrity of insulation
<br>• Check for air leaks through cracks, holes, and worn parts like gaskets and seals
<br>• Lubricate door hinges and handles
<br>• Check for loose electrical connections
<br>• Clear drain lines of debris
<br>• Check temperature and defrost settings and calibrate thermometers
<br>• Check filters on ice makers
<br>• Thoroughly clean all ice maker components
<br>
<br><strong>Difference Between Air Conditioning and Refrigeration
</strong><br>In refrigeration, the apparatus supplies thermal energy from one place to a place of higher temperature whereas in air conditioning, the thermal energy is taken from the air in order to cool the air. Naturally, thermal energy can be seen flowing from higher temperature bearing place to lower temperature bearing place.
<br>The use of heat pump and refrigerator applications can be seen in all these types of appliances. An AC has an indoor and outdoor unit connected with a pipe, the air is heated, compressed, condensed and then liquified, then the liquid gas evaporates and then cooled with the help of condenser to give the cooled air which we experience.
<br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Air Conditioning 
</strong><br>• Thermal energy is taken away from the place to keep the air cooler
<br>• It is a type of refrigeration used to cool large area
<br>• It deals with maintaining the temperature of a certain volume of air and also maintaining the purity and humidity
<br>• The compressor and condenser are a separate unit from the evaporator
<br>• The mechanism is supplied with gas from the tubes
<br>• Cold air is pushed away from the unit
<br>
<strong><br>Refrigeration
</strong><br>• Thermal energy is transferred from one place to a place of higher temperature
<br>• Helps to flow thermal energy against the natural flow of heat
<br>• It deals only with regulating the temperature of air such as cooling and freezing of products
<br>• The appliance has a condenser, compressor, and evaporator in one set unit
<br>• Internal chemicals and even air are supplied from the environment
<br>• Cold air is kept inside the unit
