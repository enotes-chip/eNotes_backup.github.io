                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Introductions
</strong><br>Eggs are one of the most nutritious and versatile foods in the kitchen and are served on their own, used as an ingredient in many dishes starting from soup to desserts. It provides texture, structure, flavour and moisture as well as the nutrition. Eggs can be brown or white; colour has no effect on quality or flavour but depends on the breed of the hen.
<br>
<br><strong>Nutritional Value
</strong><br>The nutritional value of eggs varies with their size; it is not an important factor in judging their quality. Larger the eggs, of course, have more food value than small ones. A single large egg provides 6.5grm of protein or about 13% of the recommended daily intake for adults, as well as 80 calories and a good amount of iron, phosphorus, thiamine and vitamins like A, D, E and K. 
<br>
<br>The disadvantage of egg as a staple diet is their high cholesterol content. The yolk of an egg is about 50% water,34%lipids, fats and related substances and 16% protein with traces of glucose and minerals. 
<br>
<br><strong>Significance
</strong><br>Eggs are essential to all kinds of cooking, not only in the preparation but as food in their own right. They produce meals that are economical in price, and with a minimum of waste and time. By the term egg we mean those of the domestic hen, but these are not the only edible eggs. There are those of ducks, geese, turkeys, also of wild birds such as plovers and gulls.
<br>
<br>An egg has been described as a “Complete Food” because they are highly nutritious and used in a range of recipes. Yolks and eggs are used separately.&nbsp; In all culinary preparations, eggs are used for binding, coloring, enriching, increasing volume, coating, etc.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>EGG GRADES

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Shell
</strong><br>Bumpy and grainy in texture, an eggshell is covered with as many as 17,000 tiny pores. Eggshell is made almost entirely of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals. It is a semi-permeable membrane, which means that air and moisture can pass through its pores. The shell also has a thin outermost coating called the bloom or cuticle that helps keep out bacteria and dust.
<br>
<br><strong>Inner and Outer Membranes
</strong><br>Lying between the eggshell and egg white, these two transparent protein membranes provide efficient defense against bacterial invasion. If you tug at these layers, you’ll find they’re surprisingly strong. They’re made partly of keratin,&nbsp; a protein that’s also in human hair.
<br>
<br><strong>Air Cell
</strong><br>An air space forms when the contents of the egg cool and contract after the egg is laid. The air cell usually rests between the outer and inner membranes at the egg’s larger end, and it accounts for the crater you often see at the end of a hard-cooked egg. The air cell grows larger as egg ages
<br>
<br><strong>Albumen
</strong><br>The egg white is known as the albumen, which comes from albus, the Latin word for “white.” Four alternating layers of thick and thin albumen contain approximately 40 different proteins, the main components of the egg white in addition to water.
<br>
<br><strong>Chalazae
</strong><br>Opaque ropes of egg white, the chalazae hold the yolk in the center of the egg. Like little anchors, they attach the yolk’s casing to the membrane lining the eggshell. The more prominent they are, the fresher the egg.
<br>
<br><strong>Vitelline Membrane
</strong><br>The clear casing that encloses the yolk.
<br>
<br><strong>Yolk
</strong><br>The yolk contains less water and more protein than the white, some fat, and most of the vitamins and minerals of the egg. These include iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, phosphorus, calcium, thiamine, and riboflavin. The yolk is also a source of lecithin, an effective emulsifier. Yolk color ranges from just a hint of yellow to a magnificent deep orange, according to the feed and breed of the hen.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Various uses of egg in culinary
</strong><br>• Binding
<br>• Coating
<br>• Leavening
<br>• Emulsifying
<br>• Thickening
<br>• Decoration and Garnishing
<br>• Clarifying
<br><br><strong>Binding
</strong><br>Addition of eggs to minced mead and mashed vegetables etc. helps to bind the mixture. As the heat coagulates, the proteins are bound into a cohesive mass. It helps to retain the shape of mutton croquettes, meatloaf, medallions, hamburgers, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Coating
</strong><br>The egg and egg batter help to give a coat to the food items and prevent them from disintegrating and give them a protective coating. Many of the food items such as fish fillets, croquettes, etc. are dipped into the batter before crumbing and then fried. Eggs are also used for preparing pancake batters.
<br>
<br><strong>Leavening
</strong><br>By beating the egg whites, foam is made up of air bubbles, surrounded by a thin elastic film of egg white. The mixture, when added to products such as sponge cakes, meringues, soufflés, etc., increases the volume and the egg white film hardens. The addition of sugar to egg white makes it stable, smooth, and the foam does not collapse easily. Egg yolk has a less foaming power because of its fat content. An egg is used as the principal ingredient for Chou paste from which éclairs, beignets, fritters, and profiteroles are made.
<br>
<br><strong>Emulsifying
</strong><br>Eggs form stable emulsions. For example, mayonnaise, oil, and vinegar separate unless oil droplets are coated with a substance that keeps them from separating. Eggs are the emulsifiers that give a smooth mayonnaise sauce. It is also used as an emulsifier in ice creams, cakes, cream puffs. Eggs enhance color and shine.
<br>
<strong><br>Thickening
</strong><br>Eggs help to improve the consistency of gravies, curries, sauces, and soups. Egg liaisons used in soups and sauces help to thicken and improve consistency. When used in custards, the heat coagulates the eggs and makes the custard firm.
<br>
<br><strong>Decoration and Garnishing of Dishes
</strong><br>Silver, sieved or quarters of boiled eggs are used to decorate or garnish dishes such as salads, biryanis, curries, Vienna steaks, etc. For Consommé Xavier, threaded eggs are added as a garnish.
<br>
<br><strong>Clarifying
</strong><br>Consommés are clarified with egg whites.
<br>
<br><strong>Egg in Cookery
</strong><br>Eggs find a special place on the breakfast menu. It is eaten by almost 80 per cent of the people in the world for breakfast. The egg counters are the busiest in breakfast preparations. Eggs are prepared in various ways but the most common cooking methods used for breakfast are boiled, poached, pan-fried, and also deep-fried.
<br>
<br><strong>Boiled</strong>
<br>Boiling of the egg can be quite tedious, especially when the guest asks for an egg boiled for a typical
time. Some hotels have egg timers to monitor the same. But though they are called boiled, the water should be at a simmer and not at a rolling boil.
<br>The eggs should preferably be at room temperature to prevent the shell from cracking. Like most other egg preparations chat have varying degrees of doneness, boiled eggs are cooked hard, soft, or medium.
<br>• Soft boiled—3 to 5 minutes
<br>• Medium boiled—7 to 8 minutes
<br>• Hard boiled—10 to 15 minutes
<br>
<br>The boiling time referred to above are for eggs that are at room temperature and placed in water that is already simmering. The time spans given are broad due to the different sizes of eggs. For smaller eggs. lower the time and for larger eggs. higher che limit. Never overcook a hard-boiled egg as the white would get tough and the egg will darken around the yolk.
<br>
<strong><br>Fried Eggs
</strong><br>A fried egg has to be glossy, tender, and moist no matter what the degree of doneness is. Always break the eggs into a bowl, so if there are any blood spots or a broken yolk you can save the egg for some other preparation.
<br>
<br>Use a well-seasoned pan, hear it over a low fire till warm, add butter but remember the temperature should be just warm, when you slide in the egg. Deep-fried eggs are traditionally tried in hot oil; but mostly when we refer to fried eggs on the buffet they are pan-fried. 
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Sunny side up</strong> Fried but not turned over or Hipped over, the white should be cooked firm and the yolk should be cooked medium 
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Over easy</strong> It is best to make this by placing a sunny side up fried egg under a heat source. The thin film of albumen, which coats the yolk. will cook and form a white layer over the yolk.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Turned over or over well</strong> This is a sunny side up fried egg that is flipped over. Both the yolk and white are to be firm.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Scrambled eggs</strong> Whites and yellow are beaten together, then fried and broken up while cooking. Scrambled eggs are normally served soft. Some chefs add milk to the beaten egg.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Poached eggs</strong> It is a simple process, but there are several factors that are critical in achieving a good looking poached egg one that has a compact, glossy, obviously tender white surrounding an unbroken somewhat thickened yolk. Three major factors that influence the making of good poached egg are:
<br><br>1. The first is the quality and the freshness of the egg. The white will look ragged and unattractive if the egg is old.
<br>2. The second factor is the poaching liquid. This is a liquid with water, salt, and vinegar. Normally a
<br>teaspoon of salt and 15 ml vinegar for about 500 ml water should be used. The acid in the liquid helps the protein to coagulate faster and hence retain the shape.
<br>3. The third factor is the temperature; it should not be too hot as to create agitation, but hot enough to start cooking the white as soon as the egg hits the water.
<br>
<br>Make sure there is enough liquid so that the water temperature does not drop drastically when you introduce the egg. Break the eggs into a bowl and slip into the side of the dish gently. When done, take them out with a skimmer or a perforated spoon and drain them well. Poached eggs can be served plain on buttered toast or English muffins.
<br>
<br><strong>• Shirred Eggs</strong> These are eggs that are cooked and served in the same dish, usually a shallow flat-bottomed earthenware dish. The dish is coated with butter and then the eggs are broken into it. Cook it over the fire for a while and then put it into an oven.
<br><strong>• Omelettes</strong> Cooking an omelette is difficult to master, as a lot of patience and practice is required. A perfect omelette is fluffy and moist. soft in the centre, yellow in colour with no brown at all. It should be cooked at 60-70°C. It should be oval in shape and one continuous piece. One can add fillings into the beaten mixture or can add it before making the first fold. Some chefs add a little water or milk.
<br>
<br><em>Common pitfalls in making good omelettes are:
</em><br>
<br>• Eggs brown and crisp—too much heat. Cook at 60-70°C.
<br>• Egg white blistered—too much heat of too much fat.
<br>• Odd-shaped eggs—eggs not fresh.
<br>• Eggs sticking—too much heat, too little fat or porous cooking surface, or pan not seasoned well.
<br>
<br><strong>Famous Indian Egg Preparation
</strong><br>
<br>Eggs have always been popularly used in India as a source of protein. Many of us eat omelettes that are overdone as per Europeans and hence, in hotels, we always ask for the guest preference. Few of the Indian egg preparations are:
<br>
<br><strong>Omelette</strong> Indian omelette is made with an addition of chopped onions, green chillies, coriander, red chilli powder, salt and is made like an open-faced omelette without folding it like traditional omelettes. The choice of additions, however, will be a guest preference as some people like ro add chopped tomatoes whereas few like it to be cooked in mustard oil.
<br>
<br><strong>Bhurji</strong>  Bhurji is our Indian version of scrambled eggs. Onions and tomatoes are sautéed in oil along&nbsp;with spices and then eggs are added and scrambled. It can be eaten with bread or paratha as well.
<br><br><strong>Akuri</strong> This is a famous dish of the Parsees, which is a scrambled egg similar to burji, but with the addition of turmeric and chopped garlic. Every Parsee household has its own version of akuri.
<br>
<br><strong>Dim bhaja</strong> This is a classical preparation from Bengal where a hard-boiled egg is marinated in turmeric, red chilli powder, and salt and then coated with a gram flour batter and deep-fried. The egg is then split in half and served along with chilli sauce.
<br>
<br><strong>Egg roll </strong>is also known as Kathi roll, which is commonly a paratha cooked on tawa along with egg. on cop. It is then stuffed with sliced onions, cucumber, and green chillies, mustard sauce, and chilli sauce, and then rolled in a paper and served as snack, meal, or as breakfast preparation.
<br>
<br><strong>Anda paratha </strong>A popular street food from North India, where flaky parathas are split open from the side, an egg broken inside one of the layers, and cooked.
<br>
<br><strong>Anda bread </strong>This is prepared by mixing an egg like an omelette with chopped onions, green chillies, salt, and spices and putting it in a pan. The pieces of bread are arranged on top of the omelet and then flipped over to cook the bread as well.
<br>
<br><strong>Anda keema</strong> Though the keema is a mincemeat preparation from India, in this case, the boiled egg is chopped in smaller pieces and tossed with a korma gravy.
<br>
<br>Apart from these, the eggs are also cooked in curries all around India. In these cases, the eggs are boiled, deep-fried, and then added to various curries.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Selection criteria of an egg
</strong><br>• A fresh egg is heavy. As the egg gets older it loses water through the shell making the air pocket larger so the older the egg, the lighter it will be.
<br>• One way of judging the quality is by observing the condition of the shell. When the egg is freshly laid the shell is covered with a substance called bloom. This coating disappears with time. So the egg may be considered fresh if the bloom is there.
<br>• One can determine the freshness of an egg by shaking it.
<br>• Another is to break an egg on to the plate if the yolk is compact and positioned in the centre, the egg is fresh if the egg is old, the yolk has the tendency to spread.
<br>• The freshness of an egg can also be tested by holding it up to the light this process is known as candling. Holding the egg in front of the light, an air chamber indicates a fresh egg.
<br>• It is easy to test the freshness of an egg by plunging into the water. The fresh egg will settle in the bottom of the glass and if the egg is stale it will float to the surface water.
<br>• Stale eggs will have an unpleasant odour.
<br>• Check for the crack in the shell which could let bacteria in and contaminate the egg.
<br>
<br><strong>Storage And Handling:
</strong><br>The storage of the eggs could mean two things. First, there is the storage in the fridge for daily use and then there is industrial storage that is done at the warehouses for retail markets. In the warehouses, eggs are kept little above freezing point and the humidity of air and the amount of carbon dioxide in the air are controlled. They will be kept for about nine months under those conditions. ‘The other methods of long storage of eggs can be achieved by:
<br>
<br><strong><em>Freezing </em></strong>The eggs are washed, sanitized, and then broken into sterilized containers. After combining yolks and whites, they are strained, pasteurized, packed, and quick frozen,
<br><strong><em>Drying</em></strong> Eggs are broken, well mixed, and then spray dried at a temperature of approximately 71°C (used by bakers and confectioners).
<br>
<br><strong>1. </strong>Protection of eggs is of great importance. When improperly handled, its properties as an ingredient and independent food item are greatly impaired.
<br><strong>2.</strong> Eggs lose their qualities rapidly at room temperature. They should always be stored at 36-40 F. 
<br><strong>3. </strong>Eggs have porous shells which allow air to enter the shells. They should be stored away from food, which are strong smelling and which may pass on their odours.
<br><strong>4. </strong>Eggs should be used within a month and stored unwashed, with the pointed end down, in the cold
part of the refrigerator.
<br><strong>5.</strong> Hard-boiled egg, once boiled and stored in the refrigerator without shelling, will be safe for consumption for up to four days. If the egg is shelled and stored in the refrigerator, then it must be consumed within two days to avoid any contamination. Hard-boiled eggs pickled in flavoured vinegar and sterilized will keep for months.
<br><strong>6</strong>. Once broken, egg yolk will keep for 24 hours and egg white will keep for six to 12 hours in a refrigerator.
<br><strong>7.</strong> A dessert containing raw eggs such as mousse should be eaten within 24 hours.
<br><strong>8. </strong>These days egg pasteurizers are available in almost all the hotels and it has become a standard to
pasteurize the eggs before they arrive in the hotel.
<br><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>One must also receive and store eggs in a plastic crate rather than a cardboard box as paper breeds germs and invites pests.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Health Benefits/Advantages:
</strong><br><strong>1. </strong>Egg is nature’s most perfect package of nutrition.
