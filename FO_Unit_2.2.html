<br>
<br></strong>An important function of the front office accounting system is to maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of all the financial transactions (credit and debit) between the hotel and each guest, so that all the outstanding accounts are settled and the hotel does not lose any revenue. The front office accounting cycle has three distinct phases:
<br>
<br>1. Creation of accounts
<br>2. Maintenance of accounts
<br>3. Settlement of accounts
<br>
<br><strong>Creation of Accounts
</strong><br>A guest account is created when the first financial transaction between the hotel and a guest takes place. It may happen at one of the following stages:
<br>
<br>• At the time of reservation, if the guest pays an advance amount (may be part or full). For example, Shreya is reserving a room for 25 to 28 December on 25 October. The dates fall under the black-out period, and hence, all reservations have to be guaranteed by full advance payment. She deposits Rs 18,000 towards the room rent for three nights, which is entered as the first transaction in her account.
<br>• At the time the hotel receives the advance payment for a booking—after the reservation has been made and before the arrival of the guest. For example, Kiran has made a reservation for a room from 14 to 17 September on I July. She makes an advance payment of Rs 10,000 on 14 August; her guest account is created immediately and the transaction is entered in the same.
<br>• At the time of guest registration, when a room is allotted to the guest. For example, Vijay from Microsoft India has made a reservation from I to 3 August. He submits the bill to company letter for the room rent at the time of registration on I August. His guest account is created and the day's room rent is posted in that. His sister, Anuja, also has a reservation for the same nights and she deposits a payment of Rs 5,000 for the same. Her account is also created on the same day with debit and credit information.
<br>
<br>A guest folio is created on the day the hotel receives a payment from the guest and the transactions are recorded in the order of their occurrence. The hotel sets a credit limit, known as floor limit, for each guest, which is the maximum amount of credit that the hotel will extend to the guest.
<br>
<br><strong>Maintenance of Accounts
</strong><br>All the monetary transactions that take place between the hotel and a guest are recorded in the guest folio in the order of their occurrence. An entry in the guest folio may be either debit or credit.
<br>
<br>The most common debit entries in a guest account include the following:
<br>• Room charges
<br>• Food and beverage charges (restaurant, bar, coffee shop, room service, etc.) Telephone and fax charges
<br>• Health centre, business centre, fitness centre charges
<br>• Laundry charges
<br>• Postage charges
<br>• Transportation charges
<br>• Visitors paid-out
<br>Credit entries in a guest account may include the following:
<br>• Pre-payment, in part or in full (at the time of reservation or between reservation and arrival).
<br>• Part payment during the stay.
<br>• Allowances given to the guest.
<br>• Adjustments made in case of any error in posting in the guest folio. • Final payment for the settlement of accounts at the time of check-out.
<br>
<br><strong>Settlement of Accounts
</strong><br>This is the final and concluding phase of the front office accounting cycle. The settlement of account means zeroing the balance in a guest folio. The formula for calculating the outstanding balance is:
<br>
<br>Opening balance + Debit entries — Credit entries = Outstanding amount
<br>
<br>The guest account may have a credit or debit balance during the stay of the guest. At the time of departure, the final bill of the guest is prepared and settled in such a way that the outstanding balance is brought to zero. If the advance paid by the guest is less than the total billing amount, the guest should pay the balance amount. For example, Shreya had made an advance payment of Rs 18,000 at the time of reservation. Her total bill at the time of check-out is 21,000, so she pays the balance of Rs 3,000 to the cashier. In case the amount paid in advance exceeds the billing amount, the balance is refunded to the guest to settle the guest account. For example, Kiran paid Rs 10,000 for her stay, but due to an emergency, she had to leave in a day and her bill came to Rs 4,500. The balance amount of Rs 5,500 is refunded to Kiran.
<br>The settlement of the guest account may be by cash or credit. In case of credit settlement, the account balance is transferred to the city ledger and the responsibility of collecting the balance is transferred to the accounts department. For example, Vijay's room bill is sent to Microsoft India for settlement as per the billing instructions while the other bills are settled directly by him at the hotel as per actuals. Anuja's bills came to a total of Rs 5,000. As she had deposited the same amount as advance, she does not need to make any additional payment nor does the hotel need to give a refund. <br><br>
