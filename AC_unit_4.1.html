                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">To cook food means to heat it in order to make certain changes in it. Skillful cooks know exactly what changes they want to make and what they have to do in order to effect the changes. To learn these cooking skills, it is important to know how and why foods behave in a particular manner when they are heated. 
<br>
<br><strong>Effects of Heat on Food:
</strong><br>Foods are composed of protein, fats, carbohydrates and water plus trace elements like minerals, vitamins, pigments and flavour elements. It is important to understand how these elements react when heated and when mixed with each other. You must understand why foods behave as they do and then you can get them to behave, as you want them to. 
<br>
<strong><br>COOKING TECHNIQUES
</strong><br>Methods of Heat Transfer: Heat can be transferred by three methods conduction, convection and radiation. Two or three of these methods may be combined. For example, in baking a cake, convected heat cooks the mixture, when the cake comes in contact with the cooking utensil. Heat is also transferred by conduction. The browning of the cake is by radiation.
<br>
<br><strong>Conduction</strong> is the passage of heat through a solid or one solid to another provided they are in contact pot on a hot plate. Some materials retain heat better than others. Copper, for example, heats up very quickly and evenly but does not retain heat well. Stainless steel, iron, pyrex and ceramic cookware, on the other hand, retain health well. Heat conduction includes shallow-frying, sauteing and stir-frying.
<br>
<br><strong>Convection:</strong> Involves the transfer of heat in liquids and gases. In heating liquids or gases, convection currents are produced which distribute the heat. For example when water is heated in a saucepan, the water at the bottom is heated first. It rises to the top because it is lighter and the heavier cold water takes its place at the bottom of the pan.
<br>
<br><strong>Radiation:</strong> It is the passage of heat in straight rays from a hot object. Any object in the part of the rays becomes hot, e.g. gas and electric grills.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>BOILING
</strong><br>Boiling is cooking by immersing the food in a pan of liquid, which must be kept boiling all the time, i.e. quite a number of bubbles should be seen on the surface. Boiling is restricted for meat and poultry for the first few minutes in order to seal the pores, to retain natural juices and then gentle boiling must take place which is known as simmering at 82°-99°C(180°-210°F). Boiling temperature is 100°C (212°F). Vegetables are boiled at 100°C (212°F). Blanching is used when food needs to be precooked or partly cooked.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• The food items should be completely immersed throughout the process; if excess evaporation takes place the liquid must be replenished.
<br>• The flavour of meat and poultry is enhanced by the addition of herbs and vegetables to the cooking liquor.
<br>• Scum that arises during the boiling must be removed or it will discolour and spoil the taste.
<br>• The liquid in which the food is boiled is known as pot liquor. As it contains some nourishment and flavour, it should not be thrown away but used for gravies or sauces. Use the correct ratio of liquid to food. 
<br>• Fast boiling should be done to green vegetables as it preserves the green colour and prevents excessive loss of vitamins and mineral salts. The pan should be uncovered while boiling.
<br>• Root vegetables, with the exception of new potatoes, must be placed in cold water to boil. This helps to improve their flavour, as the acrid taste of root vegetables are leached out.
<br>• Stocks, sauces and soups should be simmered gently. The stock will get cloudy as the scum in fast boiling may get mixed in the pot liquor.
<br>• Always poach fish and never boil. or the fish will break up. Fish can be wrapped in a cloth and then poached.
<br><br><strong><em>Blanching:</em></strong> Place food items in cold water and bring to boil, remove. It seals the juices and flavours.
<br><br><strong><br>POACHING</strong>
<br>Poaching is cooking gently in water which is just below boiling point (93°-95°C). The liquid is half as close to boiling point as possible without there being any perceptible movement of the liquid.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules</strong>
<br>• Food items should be completely immersed in the liquid and left in throughout the cooking process.
<br>• As soon as the liquid with the food item begins to boil, lower the temperature to allow poaching.
<br>• Whole fish must be placed into cold liquor to poach. Cuts of fish must be placed into boiling liquor, temperature lowered and allowed to poach.
<br>• The liquid for poaching eggs at one side of the pan should be simmering and fresh eggs must be added one at a time; this will help to get the rough shape. Placing them into liquid without any movement will result in flat eggs.
<br>• Adding vinegar and salt helps in quicker coagulation and prevents disintegration.
<br>• It is important that fresh eggs should be used for poaching.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br>STEAMING
</strong><br>Steaming is cooking by moist heat, i.e. steam direct or indirect. Indirect steaming is done when the food is placed in a closed pan, which is surrounded by plenty of steam from fast-boiling water or in a steamer. The food item could be protected with grease-proof paper, or cloth or aluminium foil to prevent water getting into the pudding.
<br>
<br>Direct steaming is by placing the article in a perforated container or on a covered plate over a saucepan of water.
<br>
<strong><br>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Only small suitable food items should be steamed, as it is cooked slowly. Green vegetables are not suitable for steaming as they lose the colour.
<br>• Puddings in basins must be covered with grease-proof paper to prevent condensed steam from making the pudding wet.
<br>• Root vegetables including potatoes must be placed on a perforated tray that will allow condensed steam to circulate, and cook them.
<br>• It is a good method for invalids, as the steamed foods are easily digested. Nourishment and flavour are retained in the food and usually the food cannot be easily overcooked.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>STEWING
</strong><br>It is &amp; time-consuming method of cooking, but the advantage is that the coarser, older and cheaper types of poultry and meat are used as they are unsuitable for grilling and roasting. Cheaper cuts of meat and certain fish dishes* (bouillabaisse, matelote) are prepared by this method, as it renders it tender and palatable.
<br>
<br>Stewing is gentle simmering in a small quantity of water. stuck or sauce, until the cut food items are tender, and both liquid and food are served together, Stewing is done in covered saucepans or casseroles on top of the cooker, or in the oven—but always at a low temperature.
<br>
<strong><br>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• While stewing, the liquid should cover the food items.
<br>• It is a slow process in the liquid or sauce and the long process of cooking will give a concentrated flavour to both the food and the sauce.
<br>• Items suitable for stewing are those which are of a tough nature.
<br>• The liquid should not reach too high a temperature, as the slow process of cooking by gentle heat converts the connective tissues into gelatin so that the meat fibres fall apart easily and become digestible. The proteins are coagulated without being overhardened and the soluble nutrients and flavour pass into the liquid which is served.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>BRAISING
</strong><br>This is a combined method of roasting and stewing. In a pan with a tight-fitting lid or casserole, braising is done to prevent evaporation so that the food retains its own juices together with the article added for flavouring, e.g. bacon, ham, vegetables and herbs. The meat and poultry used for braising is mature. It is a long method of cooking and tenderizes the less tender cuts and grades of meat.
<br>
<br>The meat is first browned in its own fat or small amount of hot fat. This seals the pores and thus the juices are retained. It is then placed on a bed of root vegetables. Stock or demi-glaze should come to two-thirds of the meat. The flavourings and seasonings are also added. The lid is put on and it is allowed to cook gently on the stove or in the oven. When nearly done, the lid is removed and the joint is frequently basted to glaze it. This latter process is always done in the oven to have an even colouring. The above method is the basic method of braising. The advanced method of braising is by first of all marinating the lardons in the wine and aromatic flavours and then larding the joints, and placing it on a bed of prepared aromatic vegetables in a braising pan and then adding the marinade along with the cooking liquor for braising. Brandy is used for games.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Braising pan (with handles on either side and a tight-fitting lid) should be in keeping with the size of the food item to be braised. This is to ensure even cooking, to avoid hot spots and cold spots.
<br>• Fresh vegetables and herbs, with aroma, should be used as a bed for the joint to be braised.
<br>• Food items, i.e. meat, poultry and game, should be evenly coloured while frying before being braised.
<br>• Braising should be done slowly so as to enable the interchange of flavour between the item and the liquid.
<br>• An appropriate liquid should half-cover the food item.
<br>• Items of meat, poultry and game suitable for braising are those of a tough nature, rather than those of a tender nature.
<br>• Braised vegetables are better if served with a good sauce made separately. The braising liquor is strong and similar in taste to the vegetables.
<br><br><br><strong>ROASTING
</strong><br>The term roasting was originally applied to the cooking of large pieces of meat, on a turning spit over an open fire, a practice which would be reasonably called grilling or perhaps barbecuing today. Traditional methods of roasting, practised at present, are (1) pot roasting, (2) oven roasting, (3) spit roasting, (4) tandoori method of roasting.
<br>
<br><em><strong>Pot Roasting:</strong> </em>Cooking is done in a covered pot or pan. Only good quality meats, i.e. small joints and birds, are used.
<br>The meat or poultry or game bird is tied to retain the shape. It is placed in the thick-bottomed pot and skewers placed at the bottom to prevent the meat from sticking to the pan. Fat should cover the bottom of the pan. The joint should touch the fat. Cover the pot with a well- fitting lid and cook on slow fire. The joint should be put in the pot for flavouring after 20 minutes. When the joint is cooked, remove the joint of excess fat. Add stock so that the juices mix and get the flavour from the aromatic vegetables, and form the basis of the accompanying sauce or gravy, which is called Jus Roti.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Oven Roasting:</em></strong> It is cooking in a roasting tray in an oven with the aid of fat and first-class meat, poultry and certain vegetables are used. The raw meat joint is trimmed and tied if necessary to retain the shape. It is put in hot fat and all sides are browned to seal the juices. Salt could be sprinkled later on. Baste the meat often so as to help the meat colour without drying. The average time for cooking is 15 minutes per 1 Ib (455 gm). The time could be adjusted to the size of the joints. For small joints the heat must be constant, and for large joints at first it should be strong heat (450°F) and then reduced to 300°F. After 15 minutes aromatic vegetables should be added for flavouring during the process of cooking. Pork and veal should be well cooked, whereas beef should be just done or underdone. To ascertain the point of cooking, the finger should be pressed against the meat and if it offers no resistance, then it is cooked. Another test is to pierce the meat with a fine skewer and if no pinkish liquid oozes out, it is cooked. The cooked meat should be removed from the roasting tray and the excess fat poured off. The roasting tray should be placed on the fire and the juices allowed to caramelize and the brown stock added and brought to boil. (The aromates and meat juices give flavour and taste to the stock.) Thus the brown gravy called Jus Roti is prepared and the actual process is known as deglaze.
<br>
<br>Spit Roasting: It is the original form of roasting. The same principle of seasoning, basting and cooking with a fierce heat is done. It is cooking by direct heat, basted with fat. A spit is constantly evolved to ensure even colouring and cooking. First-class quality of small pieces of meat are used and the meat pieces should be succulent (juicy). In the case of small game, fuel should be wood, and it should produce low flame.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Items of meat, poultry and game for roasting must be tender and of top quality.
<br>• Food items must be raised off the bottom of the roasting tray to prevent frying of the lower part.
<br>• The juices from the process of roasting meat, poultry and game must be used to make the accompanying gravy.
<br>• To facilitate the slicing of roasts and other cuts of cooked meat, pieces should be allowed to remain at room temperature, after it has been removed from the heat for 15 to 30 minutes. This sets the juices, allowing them to soak back into the muscle and it is easier to slice because the meat becomes firm.
<br>• The thicker the meat, the lower should be the cooking temperature.
<br>• Meat is considered rare when it reaches the temperature of 60°C (140°F); this is the internal temperature of the cooked spots. For well done meat, the internal temperature is 82°-85°C (180-185°F).&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>POELING
</strong><br>It is similar to pot roasting; the difference is that it is cooked entirely in butter. Usually poultry and game are poeled. The poultry is wrapped with thin slices of pork fat, covered with or without buttered paper, placed in a pot and basted with melted butter while it is cooking, covered with a tight-fitting lid. Cut aromatic vegetables are added for flavouring, and later on moistened with Madeira wine (if not available, then red wine could be used.)
<br>
<br>After the liquor has absorbed the aroma of the vegetables and the cooked food item is removed, it is then strained, grease removed and reduced a little, seasoned and served as the accompanying sauce.
<br>
<br>Special poelings are known as “Encasserole” and “Encocotte”. The poeling is done with special earthenware utensils and served in the same.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Encasserole: </em></strong>The food item is poeled only in butter, without the addition of vegetables. When the cooking is done, the food item is withdrawn for a moment and some excellent brown stock is poured. The piece is put into the earthen utensil and kept hot in a bain-marie and served in the same dish.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Encocotte:</em></strong> The procedure is the same as encasserole, except that the food item is garnished with vegetables such as mushrooms, the bottoms of artichokes, small onions, carrots, turnips, etc., which are turned (shaped) and cooked in butter before being used.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• The size of the pot with a tightfitting lid should be in keeping with the item to be poeled.
<br>• Sufficient butter should be used to allow for adequate basting and no liquid must be used during the process.
<br>• The lid should be removed when the items are two-thirds cooked to colour the food item.
<br>• The vegetables, juices and sediments must be used to make the accompanying sauce.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>GRILLING
</strong><br>Cooking by the grilling method began years ago, when meat was first placed near or over an open fire. It has steadily advanced through the years to the most modern gas, the electric grills and infrared models. The food is placed on grill bars, and subjected to the action of radiation which could be from below or above. The source of heat may be from charcoal, coke, gas or electricity, In an authentic grill the heat is located below the grill bars, and if the source of heat is above the grill bars, the grilling equipment is called salamander.
<br>
<br>The grill bars should be cleaned and oiled, or the bars will rust and food will stick. Usually small items are grilled: the meat is cut, trimmed and slightly flattened with a bat. Then the meat should be seasoned with salt and pepper and brushed on both sides with oil. The meat is then grilled on the grill bars, turned when half-cooked, brushing oil occasionally and cooked to the required degree. The fierce heat seals the cut ends of the meat and browns the surface so that all the juices are retained in the meat. It could be termed as cooking along with concentration of flavour.
<br>
<strong><br>FRENCH GRILLING TERMS
</strong><br>• au bleu - rare, very underdone
<br>• saignant - underdone
<br>• a point - just done (medium)
<br>• biencuit - well cooked
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Items for grilling must be small in size, flattened and of top quality.
<br>• The items should be oiled and seasoned. Fish must be floured, oiled, and seasoned.
<br>• Heat should be intense to enable sealing at once and colouring; a brown crust should form, which seals the juices of the food.
<br>• Grill bars should be cleaned and oiled.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>BROILING
</strong><br>Broiling is cooking by direct heat and is used synonymously with grilling. It could be done by source of heat above or below. It is dry-cooking, and can be done on a grid (iron bars) or pan-broiled, where the food is cooked uncovered. The pan or grill is oiled slightly to prevent sticking, excess fat removed.
<br>
<br>Stirred eggs {oeuf sur le plat) is an example of broiled eggs. The egg is slipped on to an egg dish, cooked on top of the stove till white coagulates, then it is placed in a broiler, heated from above. Tenderest and most expensive cuts of beef and fish are most often broiled. Grid markings on steaks add attractiveness. Whole spices broiled on a hot tawa bring out the flavours (pan-broiled).
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Tawa or pan or grill may be oiled slightly to prevent sticking.
<br>• Dry-cooking should take place.
<br><br><strong><br>BAKING
</strong><br>Baking is cooking of food by the action of dry heat in an oven. The degree of dryness of heat may be modified by the amount of steam produced from the items baked. Bread rolls, cakes, pastries, puddings, potatoes, vegetables and farinaceous dishes are baked.
<br>
<br>During baking, the mixture or moisture in the product expands by air, steam or carbon dioxide.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Items should be placed in the right position in the oven, the cool spots should be avoided.
<br>• The oven should have the correct temperature according to the baked items, e.g. rich cake should have a lower temperature than pastries, which should have a high temperature. Baked yeast goods should have a hot oven 220°C (425°F).&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>FRYING
</strong><br>Food is fried when it is placed or immersed in oil or fat at a sufficiently high temperature; used to brown the surface at least and partially or completely cook the interior of the food. Frying adds flavour to otherwise bland and tender foods; it also creates a crisp crunchy texture.
<br>
<br>There are two types of frying: (1) deep-frying, (2) shallow-frying. Deep-frying is cooking food by immersing it in fat, while shallow-frying is cooking it in a little fat in a frying pan or saute pan or on a griddle (hot-plate).
<br>
<br><strong><em>Deep-Frying:</em></strong> It is the quick method of frying and a popular method for Indian cuisine. The holding temperature range for deep-fryers is 90°C-1 10°C.
<br>
<br>As the food is immersed in hot fat, it is essential that the fat is of a good quality, having a high smoking point. The frying pan should have sufficient depth. The size and shape of the food to be fried should be uniform. Fried foods have a good appearance. Some of the fried foods are: rissoles, cromesquis, chicken and mutton cutlets, fish cakes, potatoes, vegetables, fritters, beignets, croquettes, pakodas, macchi, pakodas, vadas, moong dal ladoos, samosas, bondas, pooris, kachories, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• The fat must be hot enough to seal the outside of the items being fried. This prevents the food from absorbing any fat ang from any loss of flavour. The exceptions to this rule are for the frying of Dauphine, Chamonix potatoes for which the temperature is approximately 145°C to allow the slow expansion in size while cooking.
<br>• Frying temperature varies from 160° to 195°C.
<br>• Prevents the escape of juices: all items, except potatoes, must be seasoned and coated with either batter, flour, egg or breadcrumbs before being fried.
<br>• Too many items should not be put at a time as it will reduce the temperature to the point where the food will absorb fat, lose its juices, become soggy and heavy or break up.
<br>• The fried items should have a uniform golden colour.
<br>• Drain well on paper and serve at once on doilys.
<br>• The fat used for frying should be strained and stored in a cool place.
<br>• If fat, that has been used for cooking, is used again, it should be replenished with fresh fat for reuse in the ratio of 1:2.
<br>• If possible, a frying basket should be used to give uniform colouring and heating to the items fried.
<br>• Wet food items, e.g. potatoes, should be well dried before being fried.
<br>
<strong><br>Shallow-Frying:</strong> Tender, good-quality items, like fish, meat and poultry, are generally used for frying, as this method completes the cooking of the dish. The presentation side should always be fried first and then turned, both sides are browned evenly. For bacon and sausages, as they have sufficient fat, do not add additional fat.
<br>
<br>The food items that are shallow-fried are fish cakes, medaillons. eggs, parathas, dosas, cheelas, aloo ki tikkies, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br>SAUTEING
</strong><br>Sauteing comes under shallow-frying—the word sauteing comes from the French word sautoir which means “to jump”. Food items, e.g. thin meat pieces, fish, game and vegetables, are cut into very small thin pieces. They are placed in a heavy-bottomed pan with a little hot fat and the pan with the items is shaken and flipped occasionally over the fire.
<br>
<br><strong>Basic Rules
</strong><br>• Items should be seasoned before being shallow-fried.
<br>• Food items must be placed to cook in hot fat, so as to seal the outside.
<br>• Drain well the food items after cooking, or the food will be greasy, e.g. bacon rashers.
<br>• Before sauteing, food having a high water content should be salted and allowed to drain and then dried on paper towels. (Salt draws out the moisture.)
<br>• The saute pan and frying pan should be of thick bottom and straight sides.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>SPECIAL METHODS OF COOKING FOODS
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Infrared Cooking
</strong><br>Dry heat is excellent for cooking meat, fish and other items which are fairly tender to begin with. The food is placed a few inches above or below the heat source. Some of the heat which is given off by the heat source is carried to the food by means of convection, the rest by means of radiation. The radiation is in the form of infrared rays. Infrared rays are a form of radiation which are just a little longer than those waves which are seen as red and shorter than radio waves and microwaves.
<br>
<strong><br>Infrared Waves Penetrate Food Slightly
</strong><br>• Infrared wavelengths are small and range in length from about 0.07 to 1000 millionths of a metre. Infrared waves are energy waves just a little longer than light waves.
<br>• Wavelengths from 1.4 to 5 millionths of a metre are the most effective for cooking food, because they pass through the vapours and act on the food and the moisture contained in the food. Shorter
wavelengths are not well absorbed by the water in the food. Catering equipment which relies on infrared waves for energy, transfer should produce infrared waves from 1.4 to 5 millionth of a metre. 
<br>• As temperature increases in a heat source, the energy radiated shifts to shorter wavelengths. As the temperature is doubled, the radiated energy shifts maximum to half the wavelengths.
<br>• A temperature of 649°C (1200°F), for example, produces a maximum energy wavelength of 3 millionth of a metre effective in infrared cooking.
<br>• The closer the food is placed to the source of radiation, the faster it would cook. Radiant heat energy is transmitted directly to the food passing through the vapour blanket. 
<br>• The amount of energy which reaches food from an infrared source varies proportionately to the distance the food is away from the source.
<br>• The ultraray is gas fired and is a recent invention and produces 100% infrared radiation. It consists of three layers of Incaloy metal screens sandwiched together. Air and gas readily pass through the screen, producing a blanket of flame about 1 cm in thickness.
<br>• Temperatures range around 621°C (1150°F), reaching maximum capacity within six seconds. With such a grill, time required for grilling is determined by the distance from the energy source and its temperature.
<br>• Haute cuisine has some special methods of cooking which is done when required.
<br>
<br><strong>Forced-Air Connection Oven:&nbsp;</strong>The forced-air connection oven is best suited for use in a kitchen either as a cooking agent or a reheater prior to presentation of the food on a counter service. The advantage is that an even temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process but a high degree is reached in a relatively short time, i.e. 390°F in 15 minutes.
<br>
<br>• The oven can roast, grill, bake, thaw and cook quickly and efficiently.
<br>• The advantages of a convection oven is two-fold: it is not only speedier, it reduces the weight loss incurred in the longer cooking cycle with conventional ovens.
<br>• Forced-air convection ovens are also eminently suitable as end cooking units for prepared frozen meals coming individually or in bulk. The food can be placed in the oven straight from the zero cold room and end-cooked within 20 to 30 minutes.
<br>• The smaller type of forced-air convection oven is suitable for such installations as snack bars and bakeries and in public houses where there is a demand for hot dishes.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><strong>MICROWAVE
</strong><br>Although a form of energy, it is not heat. The principle of microwave involves a type of electronic heating and is concerned with the production of high-frequency waves from an oscillator tube called a magnetron. The electromagnetic waves have energy and this energy is transported to the desired load for heating. The energy created penetrates articles of food to a depth of 3” and causes the molecules that make up the food to rub together and create friction, supplying the heat which cooks or reheats the food. 
<br>
<br>Microwaves do not heat the oven cavity. Microwaves are reflected by metal items and therefore are unsuitable for use with this equipment.
<br>
<br>The advantage lies in the speed of the operation, although browning is not possible. It is excellent as a reheater. Microwave ovens allow direct customer participation with the use of time tokens.
<br>
<strong><br>Microwave Energy and Electric Cookers
</strong><br>The hotter a substance becomes, the more rapidly its molecules or atoms begin to vibrate. The common methods of applying heat by conduction, convection or radiation all involve supplying heat energy to excite.
<br>
<br>Electricity can be changed into microwaves using a special valve called a magnetron. The microwaves pass through air or glass, china, plastics and paper without heating them, but when they strike solid
<br>and liquid foods, they are absorbed. Their energy is transferred to the food molecules which vibrate rapidly. The resultant heat cooks the food. Microwaves are absorbed by most types of food in varying degrees depending on the cellular structure of the food.
<br>
<br><strong>Factors Affecting Microwave Cooking
</strong><br><em>• Density:</em> The denser the food, the more difficult it is to cook. A joint of red meat will not be easily and uniformly penetrated by microwaves whereas liquids, fish, white meats, etc., offer far less resistance.
<br><br>•&nbsp;<em>Quantity: </em>The heating is proportional to the quantity of food placed in the oven. For instance if one portion takes 30 seconds to heat, two portions will take 45 seconds, whereas three portions will take 60 seconds. For each additional portion, half the time taken by the first portion is added.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Shape: </em>The thicker the product, the longer it will take to cook. Shape as far as possible should have uniform thickness, e.g. truss chicken.
<br>
<br><em>• Containers: </em>They should be of glass, china, plastic or paper to allow transmission of microwaves.
<br>
<br><strong>Summary
</strong><br>• Microwave heats the food by agitating the food molecules.
<br>• It is a rapid method for small quantities and small portions of uncooked food.
<br>• There are no food odours and less steam.
<br>• Excellent method for reheating frozen cooked food, canned food or assembled food on a plate or pre-cooked snack meals.
<br>• Rapid service and needs less staff.
<br>
<br>One disadvantage is that food does not brown, browning elements can however be fitted, if required.
<br><br><br><strong>RECHAUFFE
</strong><br>Rechauffe means to reheat. Frequently many cooks come across a few leftovers in their kitchens. In the interest of the economy, a sound knowledge of the left-over foods is necessary. These leftovers should be used in some form or the other. Many tasty and interesting dishes can be prepared, but care should be taken that the food is thoroughly and carefully reheated. It is also important that only sound food is used. “If there is any doubt, throw it out.” If meat is overcooked, it will toughen the fibres and harden the proteins thus making food indigestible and unpalatable. 
<br>
<br>The vessels containing food, if placed in a tray of water in the oven, prevent overdrying. Steaming is one of the best methods of reheating as the heat does not dry or overcook the food. Condensed steam should be prevented from falling in the food.
<br>
<br><strong>General Directions for Reheating of Food
</strong><br><strong>1. </strong>To bring down the food cost, utilize the leftovers, such as vegetables, eggs, rice, paneer, sauce or gravies, etc.
<br><strong>2.</strong> The left-over vegetables could be mixed with salad dressings, used as salads and served cold.
<br><strong>3.</strong> Sauces could be made sharp by adding pepper, mustard. vinegar or tomato puree, etc.
<br><strong>4.</strong> Panada or thick binding sauces will help to bind mashed or chopped ingredients for croquettes. Mashed potatoes could be used without sauce, fish cakes, aloo ki tikkis, aloo ka parathas, etc.
<br><strong>5. </strong>Cooked left-over rice could be made into croquettes, lemon or
curd rice.
<br><strong>6. </strong>Curries could be improved by adding fresh ingredients such as beaten curds or ground cashew nuts or coconut paste. Onions, mushrooms, curds, curry paste, etc. improve the flavour and taste when added.
<br><strong>7. </strong>It is important that the excess fat, gristle, is removed or it will make the rechauffe dish greasy.
<br><strong>8.</strong> Trimmings and bones could be used for brown stock.
<br><strong>9.</strong> White sauce is appropriate for fish and poultry, and brown sauce for the meat.
<br><strong>10.</strong> Marinating meat or fish improves the flavour.
<br><strong>11.</strong> To improve the taste for fish, white meat, lemon juice, parsley, nutmeg, etc. could be added.
<br><strong>12.</strong> The flavourings and seasonings, when mixed with finely minced meat, blend better and heat penetrates quickly to all parts and this reduces the reheating time. Fish can be flaked and blended with spices.
<br><strong>13.</strong> The addition of moisture in the form of gravy or sauce is necessary for the reheated meat dish, whether it is incorporated inside or served separately as it gives moisture to the dish and improves the taste.
<br><strong>14.</strong> If raw ingredients are to be added to the rechauffe dishes, they must be cooked first, as the short time necessary for reheating does not allow time for raw food to be thoroughly cooked, e.g. onions in croquette mixture, potatoes in fish cakes, rice in cutlet mixture.
<br><strong>15.</strong> Protection of the food from direct heat of an oven or from hot fat can be done by giving protective coating by enclosing with batter, egg and breadcrumbs or covering with mashed potatoes as in shepherd’s pie.
<br><strong>16.</strong> Leftover stale bread can be used to prepare breadcrumbs and puddings, cheese toast.
<br><strong>17.</strong> Rechauffe dishes should be dished neatly, decorated and garnished.
<br><strong>18.</strong> It is important that the dishes should be piping hot.
<br>
<br><strong>Rechauffe Dishes
</strong><br><strong><em>1. Meat
</em></strong><br>Any meat or mixture of meats - white or red -poultry, game or rabbit can be used with suitable flavourings and seasonings for croquettes, cutlets, rissoles, kromesky, salads, cottage pie, mirotan of mutton, sham kababs, keema pulao, meat curry etc.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Croguettes -</em> Make the panada sauce, chop meat finely, otherwise the mixture cannot be smooth; add seasonings and flavourings to the panada and mix well. Turn the mixture to get cold and firm. Make rolls of even size of the mixture. Coat with egg and breadcrumbs. Press the coating well and coat a second time. This improves their appearance. Fry in hot deep fat, drain well and serve with fried parsley.
<br>
<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><em>For Cutlets -</em> Form minced meat into cutlet shapes, season egg and breadcrumb twice, put a piece of macaroni in the end of each, and deep fry. Serve with fried parsley.
<br>
<br><em><strong>• </strong>For Rissoles -</em> Roll out shortcrust pastry very thin and cut into rounds about 4 to 4 1/2” in diameter. Place a little of the prepared mixture on each, roll and seal edges, coat with egg and crumbs, fry in deep fat.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Kromeskys -</em>These make a dainty small entree dish. Just the scraps and trimmings of white meat, ham or tongue can be used. Prepare coating batter, mince meat and mushrooms finely, add seasoning, grated lemon rind and mix with sufficient panada. Mix well, form into small rolls and wrap each in a small slice of bacon or caul. Dip the rolls in batter. Fry in moderately hot fat till crisp and golden brown in colour. Garnish with lemon and parsley.
<br>
<strong><br>2. Chicken
</strong><br>Left-over chicken cut into joints can be reheated carefully in sauce and if the skin and bones are removed, the chicken can be used with bechamel sauce in patty cases or croquettes. Cold roast chicken could be used to prepare chicken sandwiches and canapes, chicken chat, and chicken masala fry; chicken curry also could be prepared.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Fish
</strong><br>Cooked fish is more insipid than meat and requires it to be seasoned well and flavoured. Lemon juice, parsley, anchovy essence etc. are the flavouring used.&nbsp;Cold fish may be used in many interesting dishes, e.g. fish moray. curried fish, fish cakes, fish cutlets or croquettes, fish pie or fish salads.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Fish Cakes -</em> Flake the cooked fish, add boiled potatoes (two-third fish and one-third potatoes), chopped parsley, lemon juice and seasoning. Add a little melted butter, egg to bind and cool the mixture. Make round cakes, egg and breadcrumb twice and deep-fry. Garnish with lemon and fried parsley.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Fish Croquettes or Cutlets -</em> Flake fish well, season, mix with panada to bind and then roll egg and breadcrumbs and deep-fry.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Fish Scallops - </em>Butter some china scallop shells or small deep round bowls, place the flaked fish that is seasoned and mixed with lemon juice. Cover with white sauce or sprinkle bread crumbs and melted butter on top. Pipe the mashed potato all round the fish.
<br>
<br>Reheat in a quick oven or gratinate, till the surface is nicely browned.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<em>Fish Pakodas -</em> Dip fish in besan (gram) batter and deep-fry.
<br>
<strong><br>4. Vegetables
</strong><br>Cold cooked vegetables such as peas, beans, cauliflower, potatoes, mixed with vinaigrette or mayonnaise are used as a salad. Cold boiled potatoes can be used for potato salads, tikkies or for saute potatoes. Mashed potatoes are used for fish or potato cakes, or for making borders for salads, or covering meat cutlets. Rice, cooked spaghetti or macaroni can be used for hors d’oeuvres with chopped onions, tomatoes, cooked meat, vegetables mixed with vinaigrette or mayonnaise.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Bread
</strong><br>Trimmings of crust etc., should be kept until dry, lightly browned in the oven and made into breadcrumbs. Stale bread can be used for bread pudding, shahi tukra, bread halwa, pakodas, etc. The leftovers in the kitchen are rice, mutton, gravy, vegetables, etc.
<br><br>The day should start with the chef surveying the walk-in deep freezer. He should prepare dishes using the leftovers. The leftovers should be reheated before use. The leftover items could be mixed with fresh items and prepared.
