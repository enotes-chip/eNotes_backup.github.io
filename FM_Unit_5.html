HVAC systems must be Properly selected, operated, and maintained if they are to provide an appropriate level of comfort. To maintain comfort, you need to understand the basic elements of comfort. The capabilities, limitations, and operating costs of various types of HVAC systems are important as well, especially as they relate to decisions about equipment selection and overall cost control.
<br>While there are many types of systems, the underlying ways in which they operate are somewhat similar. Knowing how a property creates heating and cooling and provides ventilation will help you to understand the ways in which each of  these is used to help produce building comfort.
<br>
<br><strong>Factors Influencing Building Thermal Comfort 
</strong><br>The concept of comfort involves a number of factors. HVAC Systems maintain thermal comfort by modifying and controlling the factors that influence comfort. These systems use equipment such as furnaces and boilers to produce heat, air conditioners and chillers to produce cold, fans and ductwork to move air, and filters and air washers to clean the air.
<br>Factors influencing thermal comfort include:
<br>● Room air temperature
<br>● Room air movement
<br>● Relative humidity of room air or wet bulb temperature
<br>● Activity level in the room
<br>● Clothing worn by room occupants
<br>● Temperature of the room surfaces
<br><br>Most of these factors will seem quite obvious to you. A room’s comfort level can be greatly changed by providing air movement such as with a fan in the summer. A humid environment can be much less comfortable in summer than a dryer environment at the same temperature. If we are actively exercising, we find cooler conditions more comfortable. An individual wearing a suit or sweater will be warmer than he or she would be in a thin short-sleeved shirt and shorts.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Building Loads and Comfort
</strong><br>The exterior wall, windows, and ceiling of the guestroom may add heat to or subtract heat from the space, depending on the season. The windows allow solar energy to enter and add heat to the room. The guest, television, lights, and other equipment add heat to the room. The shower and bath also add heat. Air leakage around the windows (and the door if the guest room opens to the outside) can add cold or hot air to the room, depending on the season. Moisture is added by the bath and shower and by the breath of, and skin evaporation from, room occupants. The bathroom vent fan removes air that must be replaced. This replacement air eventually enters the building from the outside, which means it must be heated or cooled somewhere.
<br><br><strong>Why HVAC system important to the building
</strong><br>HVAC systems are responsible for the regulation of heat, airflow, ventilation, and air conditioning of an entire building. You won’t see the machines when you enter the building but you will most certainly feel the effects of a comfortable and well-ventilated workplace.
<br>
<br>Here are some of the reasons why hotels opt to have reliable HVAC systems in place for their office buildings.
<br>
<br>● HVAC systems control the overall climate in the building. They also make the proper adjustments whenever we experience changes in outdoor temperature. During the winter season, the HVAC systems (mainly the boilers or heaters) work to keep the indoor temperature at a comfortable level. In hotter times of the season, the HVAC systems regulate air temperature by providing the necessary cooling to keep the entire building comfortable.
<br>● Having a comfortable work climate increases the level of productivity and increases morale amongst the workers and employees. If you let your people work in settings conducive to work, they will surely be motivated to perform better because they feel good in their work environment. No employee will enjoy working in an office where it is freezing, or in an office where you frequently have to ignore your perspiration just to focus on your computer screen. Having a proper HVAC system installed is guaranteed to make your employees happy, hence, giving you better work results in return.
<br>● HVAC systems not only regulate the temperature inside the building but also improve the quality of air. The quality of air pertains to humidity, and a typical HVAC system will reduce the amount of humidity in the air so your workers and employees can continue enjoying a cozy and pleasant atmosphere in guest rooms and back areas.
<br>● Proper HVAC systems are a worthy investment for any business or hotels because it gives you energy savings. HVAC systems today are automated, which means you no longer have to manually adjust the temperature settings or the time settings of each machine. Given that your entire HVAC system operates in an automated system, proper adjustments will be made right when they are needed. This makes your energy consumption more efficient as it gets rid of energy wasted on improper settings.
