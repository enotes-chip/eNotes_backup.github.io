                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Water is the lifeline of the catering industry. The purpose of serving delicious, nutritious meals prepared and served under hygienic conditions is totally lost if the water served along with it is contaminated. If safe drinking water is not available for consumption, it results in ill health.
<br>Water meant for human consumption should be safe, clear and wholesome. Such water is referred to as potable water. It can be defined as water which is free from pathogenic agents, harmful chemical substances, odour and unpleasant taste &amp; suspended particles and which can be used for domestic purposes.
<br>
<br><strong>CONTAMINATION OF WATER
</strong><br>The growth rate of most microorganisms slows down in pure water and they eventually die although spores may survive for months or years in water. Pathogens and viruses do not multiply in pure water. Water which has been freshly contaminated, or possesses a continuous Source of pathogens, is very harmful to health. Natural waters have a capacity to assimilate and transport waste. But these days, heavy water pollution has made self-purification a difficult process.
<br>
<br>Water can get contaminated:
<br>1. at the source itself
<br>2. by the addition of impurities during transit from source to reservoir
<br>3. during distribution, through lead pipes conveying water or through cracks and joints in the piping. Water pipes should always be at a safe distance from sewage and gas pipes
<br>4. when water is stored in underground or overhead storage tanks, barrels or containers
<br>5. when innumerable or unclean containers are dipped in the water container
<br>6. during service, if unclean ('lasses are used to serve water or by faulty methods of holding the glass
<br>
<br>Unpotable water can contaminate dishes, vegetables, etc. washed with it or ice made from contaminated water may render cold drinks harmful to health.
<br>
<br><strong>Hardness of Water
</strong><br>Water is considered soft if it forms a lather with soap which lasts for at least five minutes. Water is considered hard when soap does not lather easily in it. This hardness is caused mainly by compounds of calcium and magnesium dissolved in it.
<br>Hardness in water is further classified as carbonate and non-carbonate hardness. Carbonate hardness was earlier called temporary hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate. Non-carbonate hardness was earlier referred to as permanent hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium sulfates, chlorides and nitrates. Iron' manganese and aluminium compounds also cause hardness.
<br>
<br>Water is termed soft or hard depending on the level of hardness. Hardness in water is expressed in terms of milliequivalents per litre (mEq/I). One mEq/l of hardness producing ion is equal to 50 mg calcium carbonate (50 ppm) in one litre of water.
<br>
<br>In the hospitality industry, the type of water used directly affects food service, preparation, dishwashing, laundry and the maintenance departments,
<br>Water used for consumption should be moderately hard. However, if hardness exceeds 3 mEq/l then softening of water is recommended because:
<br>
<br>1. the quantity of soap and detergent needed is greater in hard water
<br>2. the colour and appearance of food is preserved in soft water
<br>3. the carbonates in water precipitate out when water is heated and cause furring or scaling in boilers. This reduces their efficiency, increases fuel consumption and may sometimes cause boiler explosions.
<br>4. the life of pipes and fixtures is shortened as they may rust
<br>5. fabrics washed with soap in hard water wear out faster— they turn grey in colour and lose their texture.
<br>6. when soluble soap is added to hard water a sticky insoluble curd is formed which gets deposited on bathtubs, buckets, etc. and is difficult to rinse off.
<br>
<br><strong>Removal of Hardness <em>(For more detail ref. Facility Management)
</em></strong><br>Hard water can be softened by boiling, addition of lime or addition of sodium carbonate, the base exchange process and by demineralising it.
<br>
<br>1. Boiling is done to soften water on a small scale. Boiling removes temporary hardness of water. Carbon dioxide is expelled in this process and the insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out
<br>
<br>Ca(HCO)3)2 ---Heat---&gt; CaCo3 + H2O + Co2 ↑
<br>
<br>2.Addition of lime removes temporary hardness of water and can be used for softening water on a larger scale. The insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out and the carbon dioxide formed is absorbed by lime.
<br>In Clark's method of softening water, for each degree of hardness, one ounce (approx. 30 g) of quicklime is added to every 700 gallons of water.
<br>
<br>Ca(OH)2 + Ca(HCO3)2 ---&gt; (2CaCO3) + 2H2O
<br>
<br>3. Addition of sodium carbonate or soda ash removes both temporary and permanent hardness.
<br>
<br>Temporary hardness:
<br>Na2Co3 + Ca(HCO3)2 ----&gt; 2NaHCO3 + CaCO3
<br>
<br>Permanent hardness
<br>Na2Co3 +CaSO4 ----&gt; CaCO3 + NaSO4
<br>
<br>4. In the ion exchange process or zeolite process, hard water is passed through a tower which is packed with zeolite or ion exchange material. The sodium cations in the zeolite are exchanged for the calcium and magnesium ions in water and water is softened. The process continues till all sodium ions are used up and water is totally soft.
<br>
<br>The ion exchange material should be flushed at intervals with a concentrated solution of sodium chloride to replace the sodium that has been lost. The calcium and magnesium chloride that is formed is washed away. The soft water produced is remixed with a part of hard water to achieve the desired level of hardness.
<br>Water softening units are fitted into the main water system near the point where water enters the premises.
<br>
<br>5. In the demineralising process, hard water is passed through a bed of synthetic demineralising resin. Softening of water is carried out in two steps.
<br>    A. In the first step the hydrogen ions in the resin combine with the chloride, carbonate and sulphate ions and converts them into their respective acids, i.e., hydrochloric, carbonic and sulphuric acid.
<br>    B. In the second step the acids formed are absorbed by the demineralising resin and pure soft water is obtained. This process is used to soften sea water.
<br>
<br><strong>Impurities
</strong><br>
<br>1. Natural pollutants
<br>(a) suspended impurities like clay, silt, sand and mud
<br>(b) dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and ammonia
<br>(c) dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium salts, lead
<br>(d) microscopic plants and animals
<br>
<br>2. Artificial pollutants
<br>(a) sewage which contains decomposable organic matter and pathogenic agents
<br>(b) industrial wastes, for example, toxic agents including metals, salts and complex organic chemicals
<br>(c) agricultural pollutants, pesticides and fertilisers
<br>(d) physical pollutants, for example, radioactive substances
<br>
<br><strong>HAZARDS OF WATER POLLUTION
</strong><br>The health of an individual is affected by the consumption or use of contaminated water.
<br>
<br><strong>Biological Hazards
</strong><br>Water-borne diseases can be caused by ineffective agents that could be present in the water, for example,
<br>1. viruses: viral hepatitis and poliomyelitis
<br>2. bacteria: cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis, infantile diarrhoea
<br>3. protozoa: amoebiasis, giardiasis
<br>4. helminthic infective organisms, for example, ova of roundworm, whipworm and threadworm
<br>
<br><strong>Chemical Hazards
</strong><br>These include pollutants derived from industrial and agricultural wastes, for example, detergents, heavy metals, solvents, minerals, organic acids, nitrogenous substances and other toxic compounds.
<br>
<br><strong>PURIFICATION</strong>
<br>Naturally occurring water is seldom sparkling clear, free from bacteria or without any odour or objectionable taste. It needs to be purified before use. Impure water may be purified by either of the following methods:
<br>
<br>1. Natural method: (a) impounding or storage, (b) oxidation and settlement
<br>2. Artificial method: (a) physical: distillation, boiling, (b) chemical: precipitation, disinfection or sterilisation, (c) filtration: slow sand filtration, rapid mechanical filtration, domestic filtration. Water may be purified at two levels: large-scale purification and small-scale purification.
<br>
<br><strong>CRITERIA FOR JUDGING WATER QUALITY
</strong><br>
<br>For hygienic purposes the examination of water is generally done along the following lines:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Physical Qualities
</strong><br>(a) Turbidity is measured on the Jackson candle turbidity meter. It should be less than five units.
<br>(b) Colour is measured in a colorimeter and should be less than five units.
<br>(c) It should have no disagreeable odour.
<br>(d) It should be palatable and free from disagreeable taste.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Chemical Qualities
</strong><br>(a) Chlorides: maximum permissible limit is 600 mg/l but the standard is 200 mg/l of water.
<br>(b) Hardness: total hardness should not exceed 300 mg/l water.
<br>(c) Free and saline ammonia should not exceed 0.05 mg/ l.
<br>(d) Albuminoid ammonia is a measure of decomposable organic matter that is to be oxidised. It should not exceed 0.1 mg/ l.
<br>(e) Nitrites should be zero.
<br>(f) Nitrates should not exceed 1 mg/l. It indicates old contamination.
<br>(g) The amount of oxygen absorbed is an approximate test for the amount of organic matter present. Oxygen absorbed at 37o c in three hours should not be more than 1 mg/ l.
<br>(h) Dissolved oxygen should not be less than 5 mg/ l.
<br>(i) Toxic substances like arsenic, selenium, cadmium, lead and mercury should not exceed the prescribed limits.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Bacteriological Qualities or Indicators: </strong>It is based on organisms indicating faecal contamination. (a) Coliform organisms include all aerobic, facultative and anaerobic gram negative, non-sporing, motile and non-motile bacteria capable of fermenting lactose at 35 to 37C in less than 48 hours. This group includes the faecal group (example, E. coli) and non-faecal group (example, Klebsiella aerogenes).
<br>
<br>The bacteriological quality of water is assessed on the basis of the coliform test. Water samples are collected in screw capped sterilised bottles. The test measures the most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria in 100 ml of water.
<br>
<br><strong>WATER QUALITY STANDARDS
</strong><br>The WHO International Standards, 1971, relate five water quality variables:
<br>
<br>1. Microbial pollutants: standards for bacterial quality of treated water are
<br>(a) throughout any year, 95 per cent of the samples should not contain any coliform organisms in 100 ml of water
<br>(b) no sample should contain E. coli in 100 ml of water
<br>(c) no sample should contain more than 10 coliform organisms in 100 ml water
<br>(d) coliform organisms should not be detectable in 100 ml of any two consecutive samples of water
<br>
<br>2. Toxic substances: arsenic not more than 0.05 mg/l, cadmium not more than 0.005 mg/ l, lead not more than 0.05 mg/ l, mercury not more than 0.001 mg/ l, selenium not more than 0.01 mg/l.
<br>
<br>3. Specific substances that may affect health, like fluoride levels, should vary between 0.5 to 0.8 mg/ l.
<br>
<br>4. Characteristics affecting acceptability: the acceptability of water is affected by substances that cause discolouration, odour, taste, dissolved salts and affect the pH. All these should be within desirable limits set by the WHO.
<br>
<br>5. Radioactive substances: pollution of water by radioactive substances is on the rise and the WHO has set standards for acceptable limits.
<br>
<br><strong>SEWAGE AND CONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY
</strong><br>
<br>Sewage consists of human faecal matter diluted with water and other waste waters from the kitchen sinks and drains, dishwashers, laundry, wash basins, bathroom drains and waste waters from mopping, washing floors and garbage bins. It is approximately 99 per cent water and contains a large number of microorganisms, mainly bacteria from the intestinal tract and soil. Sewage contamination is harmful as it is a potential source of human pathogens, especially those that affect the intestinal tract. Persons who suffer from acute intestinal disorders excrete millions of virulent pathogens into sewage. Healthy people and carriers also contribute significantly to this microbial load. Sewage contamination can result in severe, widespread epidemics of communicable diseases. It can contaminate both food and water.
<br>
<br>Food gets contaminated when untreated sewage is used as a fertiliser in fields where vegetables are grown. Root vegetables, green leafy vegetables, salad vegetables, coriander leaves, celery and parsley are at a greater risk. This risk increases further when vegetables are not washed well, not peeled or are consumed raw in salads or as garnish. Coriander leaves used in green chutney has been responsible for the outbreak of several food-borne illnesses.
<br>When untreated sewage is discharged into a body of water, the pathogens present contaminate the water and the food found in such waters. Improperly treated or untreated sewage spoils water because of the large number of microorganisms and high percentage of organic matter present in sewage. The microorganisms in sewage oxidise the organic matter. For the process of oxidation, oxygen from water is used up and the level of dissolved oxygen is reduced. Normally, water contains 7-8 ppm of free oxygen. This level promotes and maintains all forms of aquatic life.
<br>When the level of oxygen falls to 3 ppm, anaerobic conditions develop which do not favour aquatic life. Fish cannot survive in low levels of oxygen and they either leave or die. Foul smelling products are produced by putrefaction and fermentation brought about by anaerobic microorganisms. This spoils the water and makes it cloudy, malodorous and unfit for human use.
<br>
<br>The drinking water supply in cities and towns may get contaminated with sewage in many ways. Sewage contamination may occur through a leak in pipes or water from sewage disposal tanks may seep into the soil and contaminate other sources of water.
<br>A leak in sewer connections and improper plumbing in the food service establishment may be the cause of contamination of otherwise clean, and wholesome food and potable water.
<br>
<br>If water supply is inadequate or a water carriage sewage disposal system is not available —which may be the case in temporary food service establishments, at fairs or at remote tourist spots — some type of sanitary conveniences is necessary. They should be located well away from the kitchen and should have hand washing facilities. Various types of water closets may be used, like the chemical closet. It should have a cover and should be kept as clean as possible. These problems may also arise in villages, isolated buildings and small remote catering establishments.
<br>Water samples should be sent for testing to the nearest public health laboratory before using water for consumption. Water can be purified by boiling and should be stored in clean containers and kept covered.
