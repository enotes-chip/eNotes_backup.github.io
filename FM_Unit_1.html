</strong><br>In the hospitality industry water is used in a number of ways starting from supplying bacteria free clean drinking water.
<br>* Hot and cold water in bathrooms and toilets.
<br>* In kitchens for cooking food.
<br>* Water is also needed in the laundry.
<br>* For cleaning floors and articles.
<br>* For water sprinkler system.
<br>* For Swimming pools.
<br>
<br><strong>Availability of Water in Hotels
</strong><br>Water in the hospitality industry is generally supplied by the Govt. Dept.  But since hospitality units require quite large amounts of water they are required to have buffer stock of water and for which large tanks and reservoirs are required. Hospitality units generally have their own stand by arrangement for water supply in the form of bore wells. Bore wells are to be dug with the permission of local civic authorities and they charge yearly rent for bore well. Since the bore well provides hard water the hotel has to invest in a water treatment plant. The water is supplied to the various locations in the hotel by means of a large network of pipes, pipe fittings, valves etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Water Distributions
</strong><br>
<br><strong>A. Cold Water Distribution System in a Hotel
</strong><br>
<br><strong><em>1. Raising Main</em></strong> – It is a supply pipe line that rises from ground level to the storage tank on the roof top. Since the supply pressure is not enough, there are intermediate booster pumps to enable the water to reach the top storage tanks. Some times intermediate storage and multiple tanks are used for serving a group of intermediate floors. The water is stored in the storage tank through the raising main, the storage tank is located at the highest point in the building to ensure a reasonable pressure in the distribution pipes .
<br><strong><em>2. Discharge or Service Piping</em></strong> – Water for drinking, kitchen and wash basins etc. is directly taken from the rising main by branch pipe at different floors and flows into the service taps. The stop valves should be fitted immediately after the exit from the tanks for disconnecting the pipeline distribution system in case of leakage in tank or pipe system.
<br><strong><em>3. Valves</em></strong> – are generally gate valves used to completely open or close the water lines .
<br><strong><em>4. Storage Tank </em></strong>:
<br>A. Float Valve / Ball Valve – is a spherical rubber ball at the inlet pipe (at the top of the tank), drops down and opens the inlet when the water level falls and rises as the water level rises and finally closes the inlet when the tank is full. An alarm generally gives the signal that the tank is full.
<br>B. Silencer pipe – This is fitted at the end of the inlet pipe to lower the point of discharge a little above the bottom of the tank. It reduces the water filling noise in the tank.
<br>C. Overflow Pipe – It works when the float valve is out of water.
<br>D. Lid – Covers the tank.
<br>
<br><strong>B. Hot Water Distribution System in a Hotel
</strong><br>Cold water raised to a temperature of 38C is usually considered as hot. The operating temperature range is 49 to 60 degree Celsius. In hotels the most prevalent system for hot water are:
<br>
<br>1. Centralized hot water generation and distribution system.
<br>2. Localized hot water generation and distribution system.
<br>
<br><strong>Centralised Hot Water System:
</strong><br>This system is usually employed in large hotels. Three different principles used to generate hot water are:
<br>* Direct Heating System
<br>* Indirect Heating System
<br>* Solar Water Heating System
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Direct Heating System
</strong><br>• This system involves natural circulation .
<br>• Hot water from the boiler circulates through a hot water tank called cylinder.
<br>• Circulation continues because hot water being lighter rises up to the cylinder from the boiler and cold water descends down to the boiler.
<br>• The service pipes are taken from the cylinder to service taps.
<br>• A cold water system is connected to the boiler from where cold water runs into the boiler via stop valves.
<br>• Whenever there is increase in volume of water and cylinder is unable to accommodate this, the resulting pressure would lead o the possible busting of pipes.
<br>• To avoid this possible bursting, the water is supplied to an overhead cistern.
<br>
<br><strong>Disadvantages:
</strong><br>• Oxygen released while heating cold water causes rusting of boiler.
<br>• Boiling can lead to sever scale formation
<br>
<br><strong>Indirect Water Heating
</strong><br>In this system the water cylinder is replaced by a direct heat exchanger called the calorifier where hot water or steam from the boiler enters the calorifier through a coil of tubes and heats the cold water passing through the calorifier.
<br>
<br>Two circulations are followed.
<br>• Primary Circulation – takes place between the boiler and the calorifier
<br>• Secondary Circulation – takes place between the calorifier and service taps.
<br>
<br><strong>Solar Water Heating System
</strong><br>Is the most efficient and eco friendly water heating system. Each evacuated tube is similar to a thermos in principle. A glass or metal tube containing the water or heat transfer fluid is surrounded by a larger glass tube. The space between them is a vacuum, so very little heat is lost from the fluid.
<br>These collectors can even work well in overcast conditions and operate in temperatures as low as -40°F. Individual tubes are replaced as needed.
<br>A solar thermal collector collects heat by absorbing sunlight. A collector is a device for capturing solar radiation.
<br>The quantity of solar energy striking the Earth's surface (solar constant) averages about 1,000 watts per square meter under clear skies, depending upon weather conditions, location and orientation.
<br>
<br><strong>Localized Hot Water System:
</strong><br>
<br>Storage Tank Water Heater (Geyser):
<br>• A thermostat controls the temperature of water and it can be heated at any desired temperature.
<br>• There are two light bulbs provided in the geyser. The red bulb indicates the water is being heated and the green bulb indicates that water is heated up to the desired temperature.
<br>• Automatic heating begins if the temperature of the heated water falls below the set level.
<br>• Geysers are used when the duration of hot water supply is limited.
<br>• May require maintenance if hard water is being used.
<br>
<br><strong>Thankless Water Heaters:
</strong><br>• When the hot water tap is turned on, water enters the heater.
<br>• The flow sensor detects the water flow.
<br>• The burner is automatically ignited.
<br>• Water circulates through the heat exchanger.
<br>• The heat exchanger heats the water up to the designated temperature.
<br>• When the tap is turned off, the unit shuts down.
