                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Preventive Maintenance
</strong><br>• Preventive Maintenance is the maintenance action carried out on time based and condition based schedule.
<br>• This type of maintenance is carried out before a fault is detected.
<br>• It involves scheduling maintenance activities at predetermined time intervals.
<br>• It also involves repairing or replacing damaged equipment's before obvious problems occur.
<br>
<br>It is further sub divided into
<br>a. Routine Maintenance b. Scheduled Maintenance c. Predictive Maintenance.
<br>
<br><strong>Routine Maintenance
</strong><br>In this type of maintenance, regular cleaning , lubrication of movable parts of machine and facilities is carried out.
<br>
<br><strong>Scheduled Maintenance
</strong><br>• This category of maintenance is prepared and followed using experience and following manufacturer’s maintenance manual.
<br>• Maintenance schedules of all machines are prepared , logbooks are maintained and minor repairs are routinely carried out before major breakdown occurs.
<br>• It is a time consuming type of maintenance as it requires professional knowledge and skill.
<br>• It aims at reducing machine stoppage due to sudden breakdown.
<br>
<br><strong>Predictive Maintenance
</strong><br>• This is a method in which the service life of important parts is predicted based on inspection or diagnosis, in order to use the parts to the limit of their service life.
<br>• Machinery conditions are periodically monitored and this enables the maintenance crew to take timely action.
<br>• It monitors the machinery periodically for excessive vibration, temperature, lubrication or other unhealthy trends.
<br>• When the condition deteriorates to some predetermined unacceptable level, the equipment is shut down to repair or damaged components are replaced.
<br>• This helps to prevent occurrence of a more costly failure.
<br>
<br><strong>Corrective Maintenance
</strong><br>• Also known as Running Maintenance
<br>• This is a maintenance procedure where minor repair work is carried out on machines, initiated by a formal work order from the machine user department.
<br>• The maintenance crew inspects the machine and does the repair work to run the machine in a short time.
<br>
<br><strong>Breakdown Maintenance
</strong><br>• It involves performing maintenance activities after a breakdown or malfunction has occurred and then must be repair on an emergency or priority basis.
<br>• Breakdown maintenance includes repairs, replacement of parts or even overhaul to ensure that the machine is out back in operating condition.
<br>• Breakdown maintenance is applicable to sophisticated machinery which proves very advantageous from cost point of view to allow them to run till they fail.
<br>
<br><strong>Emergency Maintenance</strong>
<br>• It is carried out when a piece of equipment suddenly fails.
<br>• Increases cost due to unplanned downtime of equipment's.
<br>• May involve prolonged downtime if proper human power and components are not easily available.
<br>• May increase costs associated with repair or replacement of equipment on urgent basis.
<br>• Increases labour cost, especially if overtime is needed.
<br>
<br><strong>Preventive Maintenance v/s Breakdown Maintenance
</strong><br>
<br>Preventive Maintenance
<br>High Cost.
<br>Increases operational life of equipment.
<br>Results in an estimated 12 to 18 per cent cost saving as compared to breakdown maintenance .
<br>Maintenance activities that are not required are carried out.
<br>
<br><strong>Breakdown Maintenance
</strong><br>Lower Cost.
<br>Allows the equipment to run up to the point of failure.
<br>May increase costs associated with repair or replacement of equipment on an urgent basis.
<br>No maintenance is carried out until a breakdown
