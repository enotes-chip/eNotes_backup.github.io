</strong><br>Hotels produce a lot of waste water and usually the waste water is disposed of in water bodies such as river, sea, lake or as landfill. But acc. to the norms of the PCB (Pollution Control Board) , sewage needs to be properly treated before it is disposed.  
<br>
<br><strong>SEWAGE TREATMENT:
</strong><br>It is the process of removing the contaminants from sewage to convert it to a composition of clear liquid and solid, which are fit for discharge to the environment or for reuse.
<br> 
<br><strong>SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT
</strong><br>• In the most sophisticated treatment, clear potable water can be obtained while leaving only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of solids after treatment.
<br>• This solid part, called sludge, is further processed to produce what is called bio solid, which have many uses.
<br>• While hoteliers can discharge their sewage to the public sewerage, along with town sewage, for treatment in the city sewage treatment plant and final disposal.
<br>• Many hotels have opted for in-house, Sewage Treatment Plants, where they get fresh water for reuse and may use the sludge as manure for garden activities.
<br>• The fundamental principal of purifying sewage is to completely break down the original organic matter in it by the action of microorganisms (bacteria). These microorganisms digest (eat away) the original organic matter leaving a clear effluent and solids.
<br>
<br><strong>The stages in treatment of sewage are as follows:
</strong><br>1. Primary Treatment: This removes the suspended and floating objects by means of strainer, screens, grit chamber, sedimentation tanks, septic tanks, etc. The typical materials that are removed in this stage include large objects such as sticks, rugs, rocks, sand, gravel, fats, oils, grease etc.
<br>2. Secondary Treatment: This treatment is designed to degrade the biological and organic content of the sewage by means of microbial action. The bacteria present in the sewage consume all the organic matter.
<br>3. Tertiary process with or without disinfectant: The final treatment is performed at this stage before making eventual disposal of the treated wastewater. Tertiary treatment comprises of many processes and includes filtration, disinfection and removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which encourage algae formation. Disinfection can be done with chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet treatment. In many cases, disinfection is done as the last activity (also called effluent polishing). The purpose of disinfection is to destroy residual bacteria in water after secondary treatment, thus rendering it very safe for final disposal.
<br>
<br><strong>Methods of Sewage Disposal
</strong><br>Sewage disposal is broadly classified into the following types:&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Dilution</strong> – Raw sewage or partly treated sewage is thrown into natural water bodies such as sea, river, lake, marshy land, etc. Self-purification is the mechanism in this process, which is helped by the following factors:
<br>• Dilution of contaminants by dispersion in flowing water.
<br>• Sedimentation of particles to the water bed.
<br>• Oxidation of organic matter by dissolved oxygen in water.
<br>• Sunlight, which kills harmful bacteria.
<br>• Microbial organisms consuming the solid organic matter in sewage.
<br>Purification – This process comprises of a change in the chemical and biochemical character of the sewage in a treatment plant and is affected through one or a combination of the following processes:
<br>
<br><strong>LAND FILL AND IRRIGATION:</strong>
<br>Raw or partly treated sewage is dumped on land. A part evaporates, while a part percolate. Purification is accomplished by natural oxidation. This is a very good method of sewage disposal where land is available. Bright sunshine helps in microbial activities in the sewage. Decomposed sewage becomes an excellent manure for crops. However, if harmful bacteria percolate through ground subsoil reaching the ground water, it could contaminate ground water.
<br>
<br><strong>Chemical Treatment:</strong> Effected by addition of chemicals such as lime, alum etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Septic Tank</strong> – Used to provide disposal of sewage in a plain sedimentation tank where biochemical reactions (decomposition) also takes place. After decomposition sewage is purified and effluent is taken to soak pits for disposal to city sewers. The solid portion remains in the septic tank due to which the septic tank should be cleaned after a period of 2 to 5 years.
<br>
<br><strong>Bio-aeration</strong> – The sewage is first passed through coarse screens to get rid of large solids. The sewage is then treated in the main aeration tank with compressed air.
<br>
<br><strong>GREEN HOTELS</strong>
<br>Green hotels are environmentally friendly properties that take the initiative and implement very important practices and programs to reduce energy, water, and waste.Green Hotels are participating in recycling programs, linen changing programs, installing energy efficient lighting, and getting their message out to their guests and how they are doing their part in protecting the planet.  
<br>
<br><strong>Ways to control pollution in hotels
<br></strong>
<br><strong>1. Install Energy Saving Technologies
</strong><br>It has been estimated that 75% of hotels' environmental impacts can be directly related to excessive consumption—including energy consumption. Installing energy-efficient technologies such as appliances, lighting, and heating and cooling systems can make a difference for both the environment and your hotel's bottom line.
<br><strong>2. Embrace Recycling
</strong><br>Another huge impact the hospitality industry has on the environment is due to the amount of waste hotels create. It's time to embrace recycling, and we're not just talking about using cloth napkins instead of paper.
<br>According to the Green Hotels Association, a hotel in Toronto is recycling stained tablecloths into napkins, chef's aprons, and neckties, while other hotels are making cloth laundry bags from retired sheets. These are the sort of initiatives that can make a long-term difference when put into practice.
<br><strong>3. Encourage Guests to be Green
</strong><br>Put cards in each room asking guests to turn out the lights when they leave, or reuse towels if possible. Make recycling bins readily available to guests and be sure that they are aware of your green programs. When guests see that your hotel is making an effort to help the environment, they will want to do their part as well.
<br>For those hotels looking to do even more, consider loaning or renting bicycles to guests, or look into installing a bike-sharing station.
<br><strong>4. Start Composting
</strong><br>An increasing number of hotels are realizing the benefits of composting food waste rather than throwing it out. Not only is it a popular and well-known green initiative that will impress your guests, it can save your hotel money on landscaping since composted waste can be used as organic fertilizer.
<br><strong>5. Save Water
</strong><br>There are so many ways hotels can save water: Installing toilet tank fill divert in older toilets can save about 3/4 of a gallon of water per flush. Transitioning to nearly water less laundry machines can save 80% of hotel water usage. Making water stations available to guests can discourage the use of bottled water. Follow the examples from other hotels that have implemented water-saving initiatives.
<br><strong>6. Plant a Garden
</strong><br>If you're considering expanding your outdoor offerings for guests, consider adding a garden rather than simply extending your patio or pool area. The Green Hotels Association notes that one Pennsylvania property has a 400-foot garden and produces organically-grown vegetables for its restaurant.
<br>Now you don't have to go that far, but even a small garden (perhaps even on the rooftop for those of you with city properties) can help counteract your hotel's carbon footprint. Raised beds can be installed almost anywhere, and placing benches—made from recycled materials—around a garden can make for a wonderful guest experience.
<br><strong>7. Support Local, Sustainable Businesses
</strong><br>Hotels can help reduce their environmental impact by making smart purchasing choices as well. A hotel can reduce waste generation by making an effort to only purchase environmentally-friendly products, and purchasing locally can also reduce the impact on the environment and benefit the community.
<br>You may also want to consider promoting other environmentally-friendly businesses to guests, such as local farm-to-table restaurants.
<br><strong>8. Implement Alternative Energy Sources
</strong><br>A number of hotels have switched at least portions of their energy usage to alternative sources, with great results.
<br><strong>9. Take Care of Your Linens
</strong><br>We already mentioned recycling linens as a way to limit waste, but what about extending the life of those linens in the first place? Using laundry processes that limit the wear and tear on your linens can keep replacement costs, and your hotel's environmental impact, down.
