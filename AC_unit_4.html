</strong><br>One of the most common uses of stocks is to prepare soups. Soups are the second course on the French classical menu referred to as ‘potage’ and can be served as an appropriate meal.
<br><br>A soup is a flavourful and nutritious liquid food served at the beginning of a meal or a snack. It can
have different textures, colours, and flavours depending on the type made. Traditionally in France, soupé was a slice of bread on which the contents of a cooking pot (potage) was poured. Soup, also commonly known as broth in English, was designated as unstrained vegetable, meat, or fish soups garnished with bread, pasta, or rice.
<br>
<br>It is important to take utmost care in its preparation, as it will create the first impression on the mind of the guest. Soups can be thin and served as broths, or served as clear soups such as consommé.
The popularity of soups today may be due to increased nutrition consciousness, due to a desire for simpler lighter meals, or due to an increased appreciation of how appetizing and satisfying soup can be. Whatever the reason, they emphasize the importance of soup making skills. Soup, according to a dictionary, is a liquid food derived from meat, poultry, fish or vegetable or a combination of them.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Broth
</strong><br>A broth is a stock-based soup, which is not thickened. It is served unpassed and garnished with chopped herbs, vegetables, or meats. Minestrone, scotch broth are examples of these types of soup. While serving them, one should add reduced stock or glaze to give body to the soup. Bouillon and Broths are terms that are interchangeable and practically mean the same. 
<br>They are unpassed soups. Bouillon comes from the word “boil”. It has a more pronounced strong meaty flavour and is clear soup with pieces of vegetables, meat, seafood, etc., floating in the soup. Broths are similar to bouillons but the liquid is a little cloudy and contains all types of vegetables, meat, chicken, etc. These should be cut into regular shapes, floating in the soup. 
<br>The broths usually have the cheaper cuts of meat, such as the scrag end of mutton, boiling fowls. Some of the popular broths are: Scotch broth, mutton broth, chicken broth, petite marmite, soup bonne femme, soup paysanne and potage fermière.
<br>
<br><strong>Consommé

<br><strong>Purée
</strong><br>Starchy vegetables such as leguminous plants, potatoes or cereals when pureed in soups, usually act as self-thickeners and need no further thickening ingredients. Many vegetables like carrots, pumpkins, turnips, peas, celery, leafy greens need an additional thickening agent as their own purees do not cohere and so the above thickening agents are added. The cooked soup is strained through a sieve and the consistency of the soup is thick. Water or stock in which the pureed product was cooked is usually used as the liquid in the soup. The soup is served with fried golden brown croutons (fried small dices of bread). Common puree soups are—Puree parmentiere, pea soup, lentils puree, tomato soup.

<strong><br>GARNISH:
</strong><br>Soup garnishes may be divided into three groups:
<br><strong><em>1. Garnish in the soup</em></strong>: Major ingredients of the soup such as vegetables, poultry cut into small dices can be considered a garnish. Consommés are normally named after their garnish. Consommé Julienne is garnished with julienne of vegetables.
<br>
<br><strong><em>2. Toppings:</em></strong> Thick soups are normally decorated with a topping. This could be a simple swirl of cream or chopped parsley, dill leaves of mint. Also included in  this category are toasted sliced almonds, croutons, grated cheese, and crumbled bacon. Clear soups are rarely served with a topping.
<br>
<br><strong><em>3. Accompaniments: </em></strong>Bread rolls, slices and sticks, cheese straws, melba toast, corn chips and cream cracker biscuits are all popular accompaniments for soup along with butter.

<br>• <em>Cream</em> Unsweetened whipped cream or sour cream.
<br>• <em>Meats</em> Usually small dice or juliennes.
<br>• <em>Poultry</em> Same as meat.
<br>• <em>Seafood</em> Diced or flaked. Large enough pieces distinguishable.
<br>• <em>Pastas</em> Noodles, spaghetti, other pasta products such as star letters, cornets, etc.
<br>• <em>Vegetables </em>Cut in various sizes, shapes—juliennes, round slices, dices of spring, printaniere vegetables.
<br><br><strong>MAKING OF A GOOD SOUP
</strong><br>The following points should be kept in mind while preparing soup:
<br>1. Always use good quality stock to make soups.
<br>2. Clear soup should be very clear and cream soups should be smooth and velvety.
<br>3. The flavour of the main ingredient should stand out in the soup.
<br>4. For white soups, use only white mirepoix and vice versa.
<br>5. The thick soup should never coat the back of the spoon, it should be thick and creamy yet not so thick.
<br>6. Keep skimming the soup and use as less fat and butter as possible.
<br>7. Season the soups moderately, so that the flavour of the main ingredient is enhanced.
<br>8. Check the seasoning in the cold soups before serving, as the seasoning goes down once the soup is chilled.
<br>9. Broth-based soups are robust and full-bodied, so use potatoes, dried pastas, and chunks of meat to create them.
<br>10. Use strong stock for making consommé.
<br>11. While making seafood soups, use a variety of fish for a melange of flavours.
<br>12. Do not use very oily fish to make seafood soups as the oil from the fish lends a very fishy flavour to the soup.
<br>13. For puree soups, use starchy vegetables.
<br>14. Add creams and liaisons only in the end and do not boil the soup thereafter.
<br>15. Always cook the flour before adding to the soup as a thickening agent.
<br>16. While storing the soups in the refrigerator, keep them unfinished. At the time of guest order, heat and add the seasoning and cream or butter, as desired.
<br>17. Never store soup beyond two days, as the quality will deteriorate.
<br>
<br><strong>MODERN TRENDS OF PRESENTING SOUPS
</strong><br>The service of the soup has always been given a lot of importance as it is the first hot meal after the
appetizers and chefs must ensure that the guests are impressed. Even in the olden days, care was taken to present soup in a particular serveware to enhance the look and feel of the soup. A clear soup such as consommié, is served in white crystal clear porcelain, whereas robust broths are served in large stone glazed pottery bowls. The standard portion size for soup is 6 to 8 oz. (200 to 250 ml).
<br><br>Chefs should serve hot soup piping hot (ranging 8-10°C) and cold soup cold and not chilled. There are many new types of crockery available to present the soups. Deep plates with large shoulders and small space in between are used to present soups in a fine dining restaurant.
<br><br>Tea cups are widely used to serve soups. Large rectangular plates are used to serve a hot soup in a small cup accompanied with a chilled sorbet on the side.
<br>The soup needs to be given due attention and detail, as it brings in good profit margins to the menu.
