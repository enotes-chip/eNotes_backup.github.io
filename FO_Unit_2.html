                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Front office accounting is actually grounded in straight forward logic and basic math skills. A front office accounting system monitors and charts the transactions of guest and businesses, agencies, and other non-guests using the hotels services and facilities. The front offices ability to perform accounting tasks in a perfect and complete manner will directly affect the hotels ability to collect the hotels outstanding balances.
<br>The resident or in-house guests of a hotel are those who are staying in the hotel. They seldom pay on the spot for the use of hotel services and facilities like restaurants, laundry, fitness centre, spa, salon, and so on. They sign the bills to verify their use of the services and the amount incurred. The bills are posted in their folio, and a final consolidated bill is made at the time of their departure. In other words, the hotel provides credit facility at the time of the utilization of the hotel services to the resident guests. An accurate posting of the guest accounts is very essential to ensure the guest's goodwill and the recovery of all the charges incurred by the guest.
<br>In order to maximize revenue, hotels offer some services and facilities to non-resident guests as well. These may include the use of the fitness and health centre, swimming pool, club facilities, food and beverage outlets, and so on. When these services and facilities are offered to non- resident guest on credit, the account of the same is maintained by the front office cashier. As the number of financial transactions that take place between a hotel and its guests (resident and non-resident) is very high, the front desk cashier should maintain the guest accounts accurately and properly.
<br>However, the collection of a non-resident account is not the responsibility of the front desk; it is collected by the accounts department. Also, when a resident guest, whose account is to be settled by his company, checks out from the hotel after signing the bills, his account turns into a non-guest account, and the collection responsibility shifts from the front desk to the accounts section.
<br>
<br><strong>The major functions of front office accounting system are as under:
</strong><br>• Creation and maintenance of guest and non-guest accounts accurately.
<br>• Tracking financial transactions of guests throughout the guest cycle.
<br>• Monitoring the credit limit of guests, and asking for a deposit from guests in case of high outstanding balance.
<br>• Preparing a high balance report for collection and informing the management about the same.
<br>• Providing an efficient management information system (MIS) to the management for departmental revenue generation.
<br>• Maintaining effective control over cash and credit transactions.
<br>
<br><strong>Types of Accounts</strong>
<br>The front desk maintains two types of accounts:
<br>
<br>• Guest accounts
<br>• Non-guest accounts
<br>
<br><strong>Guest Account</strong> A guest account is the record of financial transactions between and a resident guest and the hotel. This account is created either during the registration of the guest at the time of check-in) or during reservation, if the guest makes an advance The front office creates an individual folio for each guest—for maintaining a record of all the financial transactions that take place during the stay of the guest. On the basis of a guest's folio, the final bill is prepared and presented to the guest for collection.
<br>Hotels generally extend credit facility to guests for the use of the services and products provided by them. They fix an upper limit to the credit facility, which is known as the house limit. When the credit balance of the guest exceeds the house limit, the front desk cashier may ask the guest to make a part or full payment of the outstanding balance.
<br>
<br><strong>Non-guest Account</strong> A non-guest account is the record of the financial transactions that take place between a non-resident guest and the hotel. This is also known as a city account. The front desk cashier maintains records of financial transactions between the hotel and a local resident to whom the hotel has extended the credit facility for the use of hotel facilities and services. Besides local guests, the front desk cashier also maintains other types of non-guest accounts, which include:
<br>
<br>• Guests who leave the hotel without the settlement of their accounts are known as skippers; their accounts are also treated as non-resident guest accounts. The account is transferred to the city ledger awaiting eventual payment, and after a stipulated wait time, the same is written off as a bad debt.
<br>• The status of guests, whose accounts are not settled by them (in case of bills to company), changes from resident to non-resident guests when they leave the hotel. The front office cashier transfers the balance to the city ledger and the payment is collected by the accounts department.
<br>• When advance payment has been received for a guaranteed reservation and it’s subsequently a no-show, the account is normally recorded in the sales ledger.
