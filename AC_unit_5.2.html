                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>THICKENING or BINDING AGENTS
</strong><br>Thickening agents give body, consistency and palatability, when used. They improve the nutritive value. Flavoured liquids are thickened and converted into soups, sauces, gravies, curries, bavarois, mousses, puddings, etc.
<br>
<br>The thickening agents are starch, agar, eggs, gelatin, coconut, tamarind, curd, poppy seeds, onion paste, coriander powder, etc. Starch is the reserve carbohydrate of plants and is abundant in common foods: corn, rice, wheat, potatoes, arrowroot, and tapioca; rice has about 80% starch,&nbsp;wheat 70% potatoes about 19% starch.
<br>
<br><strong><em>1. Starch is classified into: 
</em></strong><br>• Cereal starches
<br>• Root starches 
<br>• Instant starches
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cereal starch</em></strong> is found in: Rice, wheat and maize. When cooked, corn, or wheat, or rice begins to gelatinize at about 7I°C (160°F) but requires about 85-96°C (185-205°F) for maximum thickening. Cereal starches when cooked and cooled tend to gel, while most root starches do not, as they have more thickening power than root starches. 
<br><strong><em>Root starches</em> </strong>are tapioca, potato and arrowroot which thicken at a lower temperature of 65-71°C (150-160°F) than cereal starches. They thicken completely below boiling point. 
<br><strong><em>Instant starches</em></strong> are pre-cooked starches, also known as pregelatinized starches. Instant puddings etc. in the market contain instant starches.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Roux</strong>
<br>Refined wheat flour cooked with the same quantity of clarified butter is referred to as roux. This word probably comes from the French word rouge which means red. The colour of the roux depends on the degree to which it is cooked and the usage of each roux is also defined.
<br><strong><em>White roux
</em></strong><br>It emits an aroma of baking bread and is used for making white sauce and for thickening of the cream soups.
<br><strong><em>Blond roux
</em></strong><br>It emits the flavour of toasted nuts and is used to make relouté sauce and can also be used in certain cream soups.
<br><strong><em>Brown roux
</em></strong><br>It emits a deeply roasted aroma and is used to prepare brown sauces. The darker the roux. The stronger the flavour. It is used for red meats such as beef and lamb. White and blond roux have the same thickening power.
<br>
<br>Roux can be made in bulk and can be stored in a cool place for a long period of time.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Slurry </strong>a&nbsp;mature cornstarch. Potato flour and water is referred to as slurry. It is generally used in Chinese and other Asian sauces and is added to give a shine to the sauce. One should be careful in adding the slurry to the hot liquid as it instantly thickens when added to the boiling liquid.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Beurre Manié </strong>is&nbsp;equal amount of butter and flour are kneaded together to form a paste, which can be added to boiling liquids to thicken them. Since beurre is not a cooked product, we must ensure that the liquid boils for a considerable time to get rid of the raw flavour of the flour.
<br>
<strong><br>5. Liaison </strong>which<strong>&nbsp;</strong>usually one part of egg yolk and three parts of cream are whisked together and are used to thicken the sauces. The purpose of the liaison is not only to thicken but also to enrich the sauces. One has to be very careful while adding the liaison, as it should be added into a hot liquid but never boiled again, as the egg will curdle.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Blood
</strong>is rarely used these days because of health reasons; but blood was a very common thickening agent used in the olden times. Dishes that use blood as thickening agents are called ‘jugged’. for example. jugged hare.
<br>
<br><strong>7. Butter
</strong>is also used in many sauces to provide the thickness to the sauce. Cold butter when whisked into a hat sauce gives a shine and thickness. This is also known as ‘mounting of sauce’ 
<br>
<br><strong>8. Vegetable or Fruit Purees</strong>&nbsp;used in a dish provides the thickening to the dish and hence, require no other thickening agents.
<br>
<br><strong>9. Agar</strong> is a rigid transparent gel and is used for salads and sweet dishes. It is a seaweed, widely found in China.
<br>
<br><strong>10. Eggs</strong> give a firm gel when baked and it thickens, but soften when stirred.
<br>
<br><strong>11. Gelatin</strong> (unflavoured) is used for salads, cold sweets, and cold soups. When set, it is transparent, firm and quivery.
<br>
<br><strong>12. Coconut</strong> is used for curries, and it gives the gravy a whitish colour, as also it thickens and enhances the taste.
<br>
<br><strong>13. Tamarind</strong> is used in a pulpy form and it gives thickening to the consistency of the gravy as well as brownish appearance and an acidic taste.
<br>
<br><strong>14. Curd</strong> is used for thickening curries and it gives a whitish appearance, and good flavour.
<br>
<br><strong>15. Others</strong> like Poppy seeds, onion paste, and coriander powder give body to the curries, and slightly thicken the gravy and blend with the flavour.&nbsp;<br></p>
