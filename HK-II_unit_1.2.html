</em><br><strong>•</strong> Routine checking of linen for appearance and hygiene standards. 
<br><strong>•</strong> Quantity control of the daily flow of linen stock/linen exchange procedure. 
<br><strong>•</strong> Stock-taking or physical inventory of linen. 
<br><strong>• </strong>Proper documentation of linen through the master linen inventory control sheet. 
<br>
<br><strong>Routine checking of linen for appearance and hygiene standards 
</strong><br>The executive housekeeper must emphasize the inspection of fresh and soiled linen not only by the linen room staff but also by other staff handling linen. Stringent checking should be carried out by the linen room staff. In an OPL, the function of inspecting linen may be carried out by the laundry staff. However, where the laundry is contracted out, the onus falls on the linen room staff. Spot checking of linen should be carried out by supervisors in areas where linen may be left behind, such as service rooms, staff changing rooms, and so on. If inspections of all articles are carried out thoroughly, a high standard of linen quality is maintained and the chance of a guest finding a torn or stained article is minimal. 
<br>
<br><strong>Quantity control of the daily flow of linen stock/linen exchange procedure 
</strong><br>This is the quantity control of linen sent from the floors and departments to the linen room for despatch to the laundry. To maintain an initial record of the par stock of linen in each department and on each floor and also of any subsequent increase in the quantity of linen, an indent (see Exhibit 17 .5) is made by the floor supervisor and the department in charge. The original copy of the indent is given to the linen room while the duplicate remains on the floor or with the concerned department. If the extra linen items issued to the floor or department as per the indent are returned, the signature of the linen room supervisor is obtained on the duplicate copy. This ensures that extra linen items that are not required daily on the floor or in the department are returned and are no longer the responsibility of the floor or department in question. 
<br>Proper linen exchange procedures are essential in the control of linen. 
<br>
<br><em>The control of linen in the linen room is carried out by 
</em><br><strong>• </strong>The daily supervision of the work done by the linen room attendants, and 
<br><strong>• </strong>by the use of the linen room entry book. 
<br>
<br>The linen room entry book contains daily records of the soiled linen brought to the linen room from the various floors and departments as well as the amount of soiled linen sent to the laundry. There is no duplicate for this record as it is for the reference of the linen room staff only. It is signed and maintained by the linen room supervisor and it helps him/her to keep track of the day-to-day movement of the linen handled by the staff. It also indicates why the total amount of soiled linen received in a day is not equal to the amount despatched to the laundry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Stock-taking or physical inventory of linen 
</strong><br>Stock-taking of linen is a physical verification, by counting, of the stocks of all linen items at all points in the cycle. It is carried out at periodic intervals or at the time of the 'closing of books' for evaluation purposes. Accurate recording of entries is important during stock-taking so that the overages and shortages can be determined from the difference between the physical count of balances and the balance appearing in the accounts inventory ledger. 
<br>
<br>The physical counting is done after every 3 months and is known as a 'quarterly inventory'. First, all items-including discards-are segregated and grouped. Then items in circulation and items kept in the store are counted up separately and the totals are added together. The discards are stamped 'condemned' and set aside. Now the counted total should tally with the last inventory figure plus the issued items received after that. The inventory must be conducted in the presence of the housekeeper, with stock-taking for uniforms, room linen, and restaurant linen being done on separate days. 
<br>
<br><strong>Proper documentation of linen 
</strong><br>The master inventory control sheet helps the executive housekeeper analyze the results of the physical inventory. By subtracting the counted total for each linen article from the expected quantity corresponding the executive housekeeper can accurately determine the number lost. 
<br>Linen loss is the difference from the total obtained during the previous inventory. While physical inventories reveal the losses for linen items, they do not show why these losses occur. If the difference between the expected and actual quantities is high, further investigation is needed. 
<br>After each physical inventory, the executive housekeeper should make sure that the par levels are brought back to the level originally established for each linen item. The par 
<br>
<br><strong>Importance of Stocktaking
</strong><br>Stocktaking highlights stock control issues and areas where a department needs to improve in order to be even more profitable. The importance of stock-taking is as follows:
<br><strong>•</strong> Stocktaking helps Housekeeping executives to find out any thefts in the department.
<br><strong>•</strong> Regular stock taking will also highlight problems with damaged stock, unprocessed or missing orders, and poor stock control practices.
<br><strong>•</strong> Stocktaking will highlight any shortages departments weren’t aware of and will prompt them to order more next time.
<br><strong>• </strong>Stocktaking acts to improve areas of weakness and loss.
<br> 
<br><strong>Methods and Principles involved
</strong><br><strong>• </strong>Physical counting is done after every three months and is also known as quarterly inventory.
<br><strong>•</strong> All items are segregated and grouped including discards.
<br><strong>•</strong> Counting of items in circulation and in-store is separately done and added together.
<br><strong>•</strong> Discards are stamped “condemned “and kept aside.
<br><strong>• </strong>Counted total should tally with the last inventory figures plus issues received after that.
<br><strong>•</strong> Inventory must be conducted in the presence of the housekeeper, Accounts clerk, and auditor.
<br><strong>•</strong> Stocktaking is conducted on three separate days, each for Uniforms, Room linen, and Restaurant linen.&nbsp;<br></p>
