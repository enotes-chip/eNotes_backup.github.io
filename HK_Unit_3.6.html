</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Considerations before choosing a floor:-
</strong><br>1. Will there be heavy wear?
<br>2. Is the area subject to moisture?
<br>3. Does the floor need to be a sound barrier?
<br>4. How easy is it to clean &amp; maintain?
<br>5. To what degree does the floor need to be slip-resistant?
<br>6. Can it cause allergies or asthma?
<br>7. How durable is the product?
<br>8. Is it suitable for the subfloor?
<br> 
<br><strong>Subfloor:-
</strong><br>A subfloor is what’s below your flooring material.
<br> 
<br><strong><em>Advantages of subfloor:
</em></strong><br>● Provides drainage abilities.
<br>● Warms flooring material upto 30%.
<br>● Protects against moisture seepage.
<br>● Lengthens the life of new flooring.
<br>● Increase its feel &amp; quality.
<br> 
<br>Examples of subfloors:-Plywood, Plank, Oriented Strand Board, Concrete.
<br><strong>1. Plywood: </strong> Made from thin sheets of usual pinewood those are glued together, forming 4ft x 8ft sheets.
<br><strong>2. Plank:</strong> There are ¾ inch thick x 4 – 8-inch wide southern pine boards which are nailed together.
<br><strong>3. Oriented Strand Board:</strong>  It is a bunch of wood chips glued together.
<br><strong>4. Concrete: </strong>Consists of slabs of 4 – 6-inch thick concrete pour. It may tend to absorb moisture which might take longer to dry.
<br><br><strong>Classification of Floor Finishes:-</strong>
<br><strong>1. HARD</strong>
<br>Cementitious (Terrazzo &amp; Granolithic) 
<br>Stone (Marble. Slate etc) 
<br>Resin 
<br>Bitumastic 
<br>Magnesite 
<br>Wood&nbsp;<br><strong>2. SEMI – HARD
</strong><br>Thermoplastic tiles 
<br>Vinyl 
<br>Rubber 
<br>Linoleum 
<br>Cork&nbsp;<br><strong>3. SOFT</strong>
<br>Carpets&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Hard Floors
</strong><br><strong><em>Stone
</em></strong><br>Long life and natural in appearance. All stones are heavy and must be put on a concrete subfloor. For e.g.
<br>●<strong> Marble:</strong> Composition: Calcite &amp; Calcium Carbonate. Available in a wide range of colors. More porous, soft &amp; chemically sensitive than granite. Harmed by acid including soft drinks. ● Absorbs Oil. Should be sealed with penetrating sealers. Use neutral cleaners. Do not clean at high pressure.
<br>●<strong> Granite</strong>: Composition: Quartz &amp; Feldspar. Hardest in nature. Resistant to most chemicals except oil. Sealed with oil-repellent sealers. Do not use hydrofluoric acid. Can be cleaned at high pressure.
<br>●<strong> Slate:</strong> Composition: Grains of Mica &amp; Quartz &amp; Chlorite, Hematite &amp; other Minerals. Dense, but soft &amp; easily scratched. Low porosity to oil &amp; other liquids.Has an uneven surface. Sealed with oil repellent sealers. Never cleaned at high pressure.
<br> 
<br><strong>Cementitious
</strong><br>Good for areas that take hard wear &amp; tear as they are resistant to chipping and cracking, scratching, indentations, heat insects, and rot. Used in areas like the basement, garage, utility areas, etc. They are easy to clean but should be polished carefully as polishing can make them too slippery. The cement in these floorings is absorbent hence avoid the use of strong alkali.<br><strong>Granolithic Floor
</strong><br>Composed of cement &amp; fine aggregate mortar (being granite clippings). Hard wearing. Suitable in high traffic areas. May absorb water.
<br><strong>Terrazzo
</strong><br>Composition: Marble, Quartz, Granite, Glass, in cementitious mixtures. Does not need protection from wear &amp; tear but from absorption &amp; stains. Water base impregnates are applied. Use only neutral Ph cleaners.

<br> 
<br><strong><em>Cleaning of Semi-Hard Floors
</em></strong><br>● Daily cleaning – Sweep and Damp Mop / Vacuum cleaning
<br>● Periodic cleaning – Soft scrubbing with Neutral detergent lather. Rinse with a damp mop. Polish. If it is a sealed flooring use a self shine polish occasionally
<br>● For rubber, floorings wash only when dirty and don’t over-wet
<br> 
<br><strong>Soft Floor Finishes
</strong><br>These are resilient floorings and include all types of carpets, rugs, and mats. They are quiet and slip-resistant.
<br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Carpets
</strong><br>● Consist of a backing and a surface pile.
<br>● The backing may be jute, nylon or polyester.
<br>● The pile may be of wool, cotton, nylon or polyester.
<br>● Used for their appearance, warmth, safety factor and sound insulation.
<br> 
<br><strong>Care and Maintenance
</strong><br>● Regular maintenance program since they are easily damaged
<br>● Do not drag anything on a carpet
<br>● New carpets should be lightly cleaned with a hand brush or a carpet sweeper. Trim off loose tufts
<br>● Vacuum clean daily.
<br>● Periodic cleaning includes shampooing , hot water extraction or dry powdering
<br><strong><em>1. Shampooing –</em></strong> Shampoos can be of two types Liquid and dry foam. Liquid shampoos produce very little foam but tend to leave a residue that traps dirt making it necessary to clean carpets frequently. Dry foam shampoos are also liquid but leave a dry foam on the surface of the carpet after application – hence the name dry foam. The foam loosens and lifts out the dirt, holding it on the surface of the carpet pile until it can be removed by dry suction. Dry foam shampoos contain some solvent in addition to the detergent to assist in the removal of greasy soil. They also take less time to dry
<br><strong><em>2.Hot water extraction:</em></strong> done by a hot water extraction machine that injects a non foaming shampoo solution at high pressure through the carpet. Simultaneously it extracts the solution and soil.
<br><strong><em>3. Dry powdering:</em></strong> A powder containing absorbents (sawdust), solvents &amp; drying agents is sprinkled on the carpet &amp; left for 15 to 20 minutes. The powder absorbs the grease &amp; dirt &amp; latter vacuum cleaned.
<br> 
<br><strong>Floor care life cycle
</strong><br><strong><em>Stripping:</em></strong> Removal of all existing finishes &amp; seals. Clean thoroughly &amp; allow to dry.
<br><strong><em>Scrub &amp; Re-coating:</em></strong> Consist of top scrubbing &amp; removing any dirt/foreign material &amp; re-applying finish to renew &amp; extend the life of the coating.
<br><strong><em>Restoration: </em></strong> Performed when routine maintenance no longer gives the desired level of appearance.
<br><strong><em>Routine Maintenance:</em></strong>  Remove dirt, foreign material. Includes daily cleaning. Improved appearance &amp; life is increased may include dry mopping &amp; wet methods.
<br><strong><em>Coating: </em></strong>Apply fix, thin uniform coats &amp; give adequate drying time.
