</strong><br>A hotel generally designates a standard rate for each category of rooms offered to guests. Apart from the standard rates, hotels also offer discounted rates to attract additional business from multiple market segments.
<br>The room tariff of a hotel must generate optimum revenue for the hotel and give the hotel proprietors a return on their investment. 
<br>
<br><strong>Cost</strong> The total expenditure that is incurred in providing services and products to the ultimate consumer of the hotel services is the cost. The total cost can be divided into fixed cost, material cost, and labor cost. The higher the investment that has been made in a hotel property, the higher would be the room rent. 
<br>
<br><strong>Level of Services</strong> The level of services offered by a hotel determines the room rent to a large extent. A hotel offering the best of services like spa, gymnasium, banquet halls, specialty restaurants, etc. will charge a higher room rent in comparison to other hotels offering limited services. As the star classification of hotels is based on the level of services, the hotels that are classified as five-star or above have better services and higher room rents as compared to those classified as four-star or below. The guest and staff ratio would be higher in five-star hotels as they provide more personalized guest services. 
<br>
<br><strong>Competition</strong> Competition between similar hotels (i.e., hotels with similar standards and providing similar services and facilities in similar locations of the city) in the market also plays an important role in determining the rack rate of the hotel. The higher the competition, the lower will be the room rent. Similar hotels should have competitive rates. 
<br>
<br><strong>Target Market</strong> The target market also governs the rack rate of a hotel room. Hotels, while selecting their room rates, find out the disposable income of their target segment. Thus a budget or limited-service hotel quotes lower prices to attract guests with less disposable income and an upmarket hotel quotes higher prices for its products. 
<br>
<br><strong>Location</strong> The location of the hotel also plays an important role in determining the room tariff. Hotels in a city center or business center (like Nariman Point, Mumbai), near places of tourist interest (like Taj Mahal, Agra), or on scenic locales (like beaches of Goa) would have a higher tariff. The location of the room also determines the room rate. Rooms with a better view (sea view/mountain view/ pool view) would have higher charges as compared to rooms facing a parking lot or a noisy commercial street. 
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF RATES &amp; TARIFFS
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Rack Rate</strong> Hotels generally designate a standard rate for each of the categories of rooms offered for accommodation to guests. The standard rate of a particular type of room before any discount is called the rack rate. Traditionally, a rate board rate for a standard room may be Rs 5,000 ++ ('++' means exclusive of taxes or taxes extra). 
<br>
<br><strong>Corporate Rate</strong> This is a promotional rate to attract the corporate market segment. The corporate rate is generally 10 to 20 percent lower than the rack rate. For example, the corporate rate for a standard room may be Rs 4,000 ++. 
<br>
<br><strong>Seasonal Rate</strong> Depending on the desirability of a location at a particular time of the year, destinations may have high, low, and shoulder seasons. Destinations like hill stations, beaches, etc. receive heavy tourist traffic during a particular period(s) of the year; the rest of the year is a lean period in terms of tourism. The duration when the tourist traffic (and so the demand for hotel rooms) at a particular place is high is known as the peak season; when the demand for hotel rooms drops down, it is known as the off-season. During peak season, hotels do not offer any discount; rather they may charge a higher room rate, known as the seasonal rate. To attract guests during low-demand periods, hotels offer a discounted rate known as the off-season rate. Hotels in these locations mention their seasonal and off-season rate clearly on the tariff card. For example, the rainy season is off-season in Shimla, while winters and summers are season time, as visitors go there to see snow in winters and to escape the heat during summers. 
<br>
<br><strong>Advance Purchase Rate</strong> Though popular in the airline industry, the advance purchase rate is a relatively new concept in the hospitality industry. It entails heavy discounts on room rates when room bookings are done in advance. The rate of discount depends upon the advance period and the number of rooms available at the time of booking, i.e., a hotel may offer more discount for a room that is booked two months in advance as compared to a room that is booked fifteen days in advance. The advance booking of rooms ensures a certain amount of revenue at a given time and thus helps the management in planning a revenue management strategy. 
<br>
<br><strong>Week Day/Weekend Rate</strong> Some hotels observe a fluctuation in their occupancy levels with regard to the days of the week. The demand for rooms in a hotel may be more on certain days in a week. Hotels analyze their demand levels over a period of time and fix a higher rate during high demand periods and a lower room rate during low demand periods. In vacation/resort hotels, the weekend rate would be higher than the weekday rate as the demand for rooms is higher on weekends. It would be reversed in the case of a commercial hotel. 
<br>
<br><strong>Day and Half Day Rate</strong> The day rate, charged from guests not staying overnight at a hotel, is lower than the rack rate. For instance, if a guest checks in at 10 a.m. and checks out the same evening at around 5 p.m., he may be charged the day rate. However, all hotels may not have day rates. 
<br>Sometimes a guest may wish to stay for a very short duration of time, not exceeding five hours. For example, a transit traveler, who has to catch a flight in a few hours, might want to take a rest in a hotel, or a person might want to rent a room for a short business meeting. In these cases, the half-day rate, which is a bit higher than the numerical half of the rack rate, is charged from guests. <br>
<br><strong>Group Rate</strong> As a large group (more than 15 persons) provides bulk business to a hotel, hotels offer discounted rates to groups. The group rate depends upon the number of persons in the group and the frequency of their visits. The rates are negotiated by the sales team of the hotel and the representatives of the group. 
<br>
<br><strong>Tour Group (Series Group) Wholesale Rate</strong> These are heavily discounted rates for wholesalers who operate a series of tours for groups arriving and departing together. For example, a tour operator may conduct a week's tour of the Golden Triangle (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur-Delhi) on the 2nd, 12th, and 22nd of every month for groups of twenty persons. The tour operator guarantees the hotel that it would provide this series of business every month for a period of one year. In return, the hotel offers a heavy discount to the operator and allocates or 'blocks' rooms for the series for the entire year. 
<br>
<br><strong>Travel Agent Rate</strong> Travel agents sell travel products like hotel rooms, airline bookings, etc. on a commission basis to the end-users (guests). They provide a substantial volume of business to hotels, hence hotels offer them special discounts and commissions. Some major travel agencies include Cox &amp; Kings, Thomas Cook, etc. 
<br>
<br><strong>Volume Guarantee Rate</strong> Hotels may offer a special rate (lower than the rack rate) in order to attract a high volume of business from special market segments. A hotel may have a contractual agreement with a company, according to which the company's representatives are entitled to a special discounted rate when they reserve a room in the hotel. The percentage of discount will depend upon the volume of business promised and the mutual understanding between the hotel and company at the time of making the agreement. A frequent business customer might be offered a CP ( Continental Plan) at the standard room rate. 
<br>
<br><strong>Airlines/Crew Rate</strong> It is a special discounted rate for the crew of one or more airlines that offer a certain volume of business throughout the year on a consistent and continuous basis. 
<br>
<br><strong>Government Rate</strong> When government officials travel for official work they are given a travel allowance to cover their hotel, meals, and other out-of-pocket expenses. Based on their designation, this amount is fixed and given in advance. A hotel interested in catering to this segment may quote room rates that match their travel allowances. The hotel may ask for proof of identity from guests before they can avail the government rates. 
<br>
<br><strong>Educational Rate</strong> Educational rates are special rates offered by hotels to students and educationists who have a limited travel budget. They are a significant source of business because of their large numbers and frequency of visits. They provide a large chunk of repeat business to hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Membership Rate</strong> Membership rates are offered to guests who are members of influential organizations that provide volumes of business to hotels. The membership rates are much lower than the rack rates and may also include discounts on food and beverage. Special discounted rates are given to FHRAI members, UN employees, travel writers, etc. 
<br><br><strong>Introductory Rate</strong> The introductory rate is offered by a hotel on the opening of a new property in town. It is a part of a new hotel's marketing strategy to make inroads into the existing market by offering a price lower than what is offered by competitors with the same standards. The introductory rate is generally offered till the hotel is established, or it may be revoked at the wish of the management. 
<br>
<br><strong>Complimentary Rate</strong> When a hotel does not charge the room rent from a guest, it is known as a complimentary rate. Hotels generally offer complimentary rooms (also called comp rooms) to the tour/group leader. They may also offer comp rooms to tour operators, travel agencies, and local dignitaries who are vital to the public relations program of the hotel. Hotels also provide complimentary rooms along with marriage packages and bulk bookings. 
<br>
<br><strong>Crib Rate</strong> This is the rate charged for children above five years and below of age 12 years who are accompanying their parents. The hotel provides a crib-bed in the room for infants. 
<br><br><strong>Package Rate</strong> A package rate is quoted for a bouquet of products or services. The rate is generally lower than the sum total of the prices of individual products or services offered in the bouquet. These rates are tailor-made for specific guest requirements. A package rate may include room rent, meals, special arrangements (like marriage set-ups, banquet halls, meeting room, etc.), and may also include products and services offered by other services providers like transportation (rail, road, and air), sightseeing, and so on. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>MEAL PLANS 
</strong><br>The room tariff of a hotel may be based on the choice of meal plans offered to guests. Depending on the needs of their target audience, hotels offer a variety of meal plans
<br>
<br>⦿ European Plan
<br>⦿ Continental Plan
<br>⦿ American Plan
<br>⦿ Modified American
<br>⦿ Bed &amp; Breakfast (B&amp;B) or Bermuda Plan
<br>
<br><strong>European Plan European plan (EP)</strong> consists of room rate only and the meals are charged separately as per actuals. It is generally preferred in a commercial hotel where business executives have to socialize with their clients and do not take meals at the hotel. 
<br>
<br><strong>Continental Plan Continental plan (CP)</strong> consists of room rate and continental breakfast. Continental breakfast generally includes most or all of the following: sliced bread with butter/jam/honey, cheese, meat, croissants and Danish pastries, rolls, fruit juice, and coffee/tea/hot chocolate/milk. This plan is generally found in hotels in Europe. 
<br>
<br><strong>American Plan American plan (AP)</strong> is also known as en-pension (full board). The tariff includes room rent and all meals (i.e., breakfast, lunch, and dinner). This tariff plan is popular in resort hotels located at remote places where guests do not have a choice of food outside the hotel premises, e.g., in a jungle or desert. 
<br>
<br><strong>Modified American Plan Modified American plan (MAP)</strong> is also known as demi­pension (half board). The tariff consists of room rent, breakfast, and one major meal (either lunch or dinner). This tariff plan is popular in hotels located at tourist destinations, where the guest may want to go sightseeing after breakfast, have lunch outside the hotel, and return to the hotel in the evening and have dinner. Alternatively, they could have breakfast and pack lunch from the hotel, and then have dinner outside and come to the hotel late at night. 
<br>
<br><strong>Bed &amp; Breakfast (B&amp;B) or Bermuda Plan</strong> Bed and breakfast plan (B&amp;B) or Bermuda plan consist of room rent and American breakfast. American breakfast generally includes most or all of the following: two eggs (fried or poached), sliced bacon or sausages, sliced bread or toast with jam/jelly/butter, pancakes with syrup, cornflakes, or other cereal, coffee/tea, orange/grapefruit juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
