                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The food handler should understand that all rules for proper food handling aim at preventing contamination and spoilage of foods. To prevent food from spoilage or from causing illness, the following principles of proper food handling should be observed during purchasing, storage, preparation and service of food.
<br>
<br><strong>Important Points to be Observed While Receiving &amp; Inspecting Deliveries
</strong><br>
<br>1. Meat &amp; Poultry: This should be purchased from a plant which has an inspection certificate &amp; inspection mark on all products to be certain that only healthy animals have been slaughtered, and that the meat has been stored, handled and transported in a sanitary way.
<br>2. Fish: All fish and shellfish should be from unpolluted water.
<br>3. Eggs: Eggs must be at least grade B and should have clean intact shells.
<br>4. Milk: Milk should be pasteurized and from an approved source.
<br>5. Canned foods: Cans should be obtained from a plant having a licence. All cans should have the date of processing, code and licence number on it. When opening cans, always open the uncoded end.
<br>6. Cereals and pulses: These should be checked for the presence of contaminants like presence of mud, stones, unwanted grains, mouldy grains and insects or insect droppings. Damaged and eaten grains or grains of uneven size should not be selected.
<br>7. Fruits and vegetables: These should be checked for bruises and damage by insects. Only wholesome items at the correct stage of maturity should be purchased.
<br>8. Spices, nuts and dry fruits: These should be checked carefully for insect contamination. All packets should be intact.
<br>
<br>Make sure food supplies are properly labelled. Discard any containers with missing labels.
<br>Always select food of good quality and visit the suppliers occasionally to check on sanitary practices.
<br>
<br><strong>FOOD STORAGE</strong>
<br>All catering establishments, irrespective of the volume of business handled, should have adequate, temperature-controlled storage facilities to protect food from any kind of spoilage. Temperature controlled storage facilities include a dry food store, refrigerated stores and deep freezers. Storage space required depends on quantity purchased.
<br>These facilities will prevent the entry and multiplication of microorganisms and preserve the quality and palatability of food. Food will thus remain wholesome till it is consumed.
<br>However, food cannot be completely free from microorganisms because of their ubiquitous nature. Complete sterilisation of food is therefore, neither practical nor necessary. What is needed is control over the duration and temperature of storage to prevent growth of microorganisms. This can be achieved by ensuring that food is not left in warm and moist places for indefinite periods of time. The golden rule for storing any kind of food is to keep it clean, covered, cool and whenever applicable, dry.
<br>
<br><strong><em>The three major storage areas to hold large stocks or for bulk supplies are:
</em></strong><br>
<br>1. the dry food store for non-perishables (short-term holding) 10 to 21C
<br>2. the refrigerated store for perishables (short-term holding) 1 to 4C
<br>3. the freezer stores for perishables (long-term holding) —6 to —25C
<br>
<br>The stores should ideally be located in the north-east part of the building. This will prevent it from getting heated by the sun and will help in keeping it cool and well lit. It should be near the goods receiving area. The kind of storage facilities and amount of storage space required depends on many factors like the menu, the number of covers served daily, purchasing policies and frequency of deliveries.
<br>The stores should not be humid or damp and should be pest proof.
<br>
<br><strong><em>General Guidelines for Food Storage</em></strong>
<br>1. Wash items that need washing and prepare food for storage. Wipe cans.
<br>2. Check frozen items to ensure that they are in a solidly frozen state before putting them in the freezer.
<br>3. Rotate food supplies using the 'first-in, first-out' (FIFO) method. Goods should be placed in the order received. Date goods on receipt and place new deliveries in the rear of the store. The 'Best before' or 'Use by' date should be marked on products.
<br>4. Store foods in areas designed for storage only and not in the kitchen and larder. Each storage area should be separate.
<br>5. Keep all goods in clean wrappers or containers. Dirty wrappers attract pests and contaminate food. Use waterproof and airtight material. Check packets before storing them.
<br>6. Keep storage areas clean and maintain a regular cleaning schedule.
<br>7. Keep vehicles used for transporting food within the establishment clean.
<br>8. Access to the food store should be restricted to prevent pilferage and to control stocks.
<br>9. Periodic inspection and turnover of foods is necessary to check their condition,
<br>10. Maintain appropriate temperature depending on the type of storage,
<br>11. Avoid overcrowding of stored food and overstocking. Adequate air circulation and ventilation is necessary.
<br>12. Food should be stored in the appropriate storage area to remain in a sound state, for example, if bananas are refrigerated, their skin darkens and they become unacceptable.
<br>13. Food should be used as soon as possible because even under ideal conditions of storage there is loss in nutritive value, flavour and freshness.
<br>14. Goods must be stored as soon as they are purchased. Potentially hazardous food items should not be left in the open yard or receiving area. They should be refrigerated or frozen immediately.
<br>15. Separate areas should be made available for storage of equipment, cleaning materials and empty cartons/ packaging materials.
<br>
<br><strong>THE DRY FOOD STORE
</strong><br>The dry food store should be airy, well lit, clean, protected from pests and from excessive moisture. All foods that do not spoil at room temperature are stored here, for example, whole cereal grains, pulses, flour, sugar, jaggery, oil, hydrogenated fat, canned foods and some fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, mangoes, roots and tubers, pumpkins and preserves like jams, jellies, papads and pickle.
<br>The temperature in the store should range from 15 to 21C (60 to 70F). Ideal temperature for maximum shelf life of commodities is 10C (50F) and a relative humidity of 50 to 60 per cent.
<br>
<br><strong>THE REFRIGERATED STORE
</strong><br>The term ‘refrigerated store' includes the domestic refrigerator, the reach-in refrigerator, the walk-in chiller, the cold room and refrigerated display cabinets.
<br>Storage of foods at refrigeration temperatures retards bacterial growth but cannot undo any damage already done.
<br>Perishable foods like raw meat, poultry, fresh fish, stocks, soups, gravies, milk and milk products, ground masala pastes, cooked cereals and some fruits and vegetables can be held for short periods in the refrigerator. The cabinet temperature should not exceed 4C.
<br>The temperature range is normally one to 4C in this store. The double door refrigerator with a separate deep freezer has a wider temperature range of —18 to 5C. It has the advantage of maintaining a steady temperature because the number of times the refrigerator door is opened is reduced as there is a separate door for the freezer. This keeps frozen foods fresh for a longer time with minimum temperature fluctuations in the freezer. Nowadays, three or four- door refrigerators are also available to store perishable items separately. The advantage of having three or four separate cabinets for food storage is a wider temperature range, lesser chances of cross-contamination and absorption of odours, and a steady temperature.
<br>The deep freezer of the domestic refrigerator has the lowest temperature and the crisper has the highest temperature. Bacteria, yeasts and molds grow more slowly at refrigerator temperatures as compared to room temperature, so although foods will spoil when they are refrigerated, the rate of deterioration is much slower because generation time is longer.
<br>
<br><strong><em>The maximum storage time in the refrigerator at ideal refrigeration temperature for some perishable foods
</em></strong><br>
<br>Shellfish    1 day
<br>Raw fish    2 days
<br>Minced meat    1-3 days
<br>Cooked fish    3 days
<br>Poultry     2-3 days
<br>Eggs     14 days
<br>Meat     3—5 days
<br>Milk     3-7 days
<br>Curds     5-15 days 
<br>Paneer     5 days 
<br>Cream cheese     2 weeks 
<br>Processed cheese (open)     3-4 weeks
<br>Cream     3 days  
<br>Egg white     3 days 
<br>Egg yolk     3 days
<br>
<br><strong><em>Ideal refrigeration temperature for specific foods
</em></strong><br>
<br>Fish     -1  to 1 C
<br>Meat and poultry     0 to 2C
<br>Dairy products     3 to 4C
<br>Fruits and vegetables     4 to 7C
<br>
<br>The temperature of the refrigerator should be checked regularly by placing a thermometer in the warmest part of the refrigeration unit. If temperatures below 50C are not maintained, it needs to be checked. The likely reasons for this inadequate cooling could be:
<br>
<br>1. opening the refrigerator door very often
<br>2. leaving the door open for long
<br>3. placing hot foods in the refrigerator
<br>
<br>The refrigerator should be cleaned inside out. Cleaning should coincide with defrosting. The time for cleaning should also coincide with the time when the refrigerator is relatively empty. This makes the task easier and minimises chances of contamination of food. All shelves and trays should be removed and washed in a warm soda solution, dried and replaced.
<br><br><strong>Operating Procedures
</strong><br>1. The refrigeration unit should be placed in an airy and well-ventilated place, away from any source of heat.
<br>2. It should not be overcrowded as this hampers the circulation of cold air. 
<br>3. Milk and milk products should be tightly covered to prevent absorption of odour and should be kept away from foods with a strong odour. 
<br>4. Prepared food should be stored above and not below raw food, to prevent cross-contamination. Liquid from raw food may drip onto food which will not be cooked again (for example, fresh cream pastries).
<br>5. Food stored in glass or metal containers should be stored in the lower part of the refrigerator to prevent condensation drippings from affecting other food items.
<br>6. The refrigerator should be opened for the shortest possible time and the door should not be left open. 
<br>7. Liquids, meat, fish and poultry should be placed in the coldest part of the refrigerator closest to the coils. Foods to be stored for the longest time should be stored at the coldest temperature. 
<br>8. Food should be stored in clean covered containers and not in their original pack or can. Covering food protects it from cross-contamination, drying out and from absorbing odours. Aluminium foil and cling film are useful in covering food which has to be stored. Food should be wrapped only after it has cooled. 
<br>9. Do not use refrigerators to cool foods which are at high temperatures. The escaping steam will not only increase the frost formation on the coils but will increase the temperature inside the refrigerator, thus favoring growth of dormant microbes.
<br>10. In walk-in coolers, store foods away from the walls and floor. Hang meat and poultry on&nbsp; hooks for better air circulation.
<br>11. Do not refrigerate canned and bottled foods unless specified on the label.
<br>12. The refrigerator should be defrosted regularly to prevent ice building up on the refrigeration&nbsp; coils. Additional ice on the coils reduces the efficiency of the refrigerator.
<br>13. Green leafy vegetables and mushrooms should be stored in perforated polythene bags in the&nbsp; crisper to prevent spoilage by moisture accumulation in the bag. Extra moisture accelerates&nbsp; the growth of microorganisms.
<br>14. Never use a sharp instrument to remove frost from the coils or frozen food that is stuck to
the coils, as this can damage them. Use a tray of warm water instead.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Chillers
</strong><br>Chillers are necessary in large catering establishments to reduce the temperature of large portions of food to 15C or lower in a short time of 1 1/2 hours. Once chilled, the food can be promptly refrigerated. The walk-in chilling room contains a refrigeration unit and a fan to circulate cold air.
<br>
<br><strong>THE FREEZER STORE
</strong><br>The term 'freezer store' includes the commercial deep freezing cabinets, walk-in freezers, open top display freezers, blast freezers and the frozen food storage compartment of the domestic refrigerator.
<br>The freezer store is used for preserving food for longer periods than the refrigerator, the temperature being so low that food turns into ice and is maintained in that state. This preserves the colour and flavour of food better than the refrigerator, especially if the food is blast frozen.
<br>Most bacteria can survive the freezing process and remain dormant for many months or years in frozen foods. Only fresh, high quality food should be frozen because freezing cannot improve the quality of contaminated food. When frozen food is thawed and the temperatures reach the danger zone, the dormant bacteria start multiplying rapidly. Therefore, food should be thawed properly before being cooked.
<br>Foods to be stored in the deep freezer should be at room temperature and wrapped in moisture-proof material to prevent dehydration and to keep odour and contaminants away. The wrapping should be airtight. All packets should be labelled and dated before being frozen.
<br>
<br>The temperature of the deep freezer varies from —6 to —25C or lower, as in the case of blast freezers. In blast freezers, it may be lower than —35C.
<br>The function of some freezers, like the frozen food storage compartment of the refrigerator, is to hold already frozen foods.
<br>The true freezer is capable of freezing fresh food and at the same time maintaining the temperature of the already frozen food kept in the freezer. The temperature range is -18 to -25C (0 to -15 F) and at these temperatures foods can be stored from one to 12 months, depending on the nature of the food. Such freezers have four-star rating.
<br>A star rating system has been prepared on the basis of the temperature in a freezer or frozen food compartment of the domestic refrigerator.
<br><br><strong>Guidelines for Freezer Storage
</strong><br>
<br>1. The temperature should be maintained at - 18°C to keep the food safe and the thermostat and the thermometer should be checked regularly.
<br>2. Each time the food is thawed, microbes start growing and this damage cannot be rectified by re-freezing.
<br>3. When thawed food is refrozen, the process of refreezing is relatively slow and results in the&nbsp;formation of large ice crystals which affects the texture of food when it is thawed again.
<br>4. Frozen food should be well-packed to prevent freezer burn, cross-contamination and absorption of odour and flavour. Freezer burn is caused due to very low temperatures and results in discoloration and dehydration of the exposed food.
<br>5. The temperature at which frozen foods are delivered should not exceed -15°C.
<br>6. The freezer, unlike the refrigerator, should be tightly packed with frozen food as cold air circulation is uneconomical. In the open-top display freezer, food should not be stored above the freezer load line as temperatures here are higher than in the main freezer compartment.
<br>7. In case of power failure or breakdown of the freezer, the freezer door should not be opened
and the food should be left inside. A well-stacked freezer can keep food frozen for a day or more. If the surface temperature of the food is below 5°C, the food is safe. It is better to cook foods which have thawed and then refreeze them.
<br>8. Lengthy freezer storage influences the taste, colour and texture of foods and increases the possibility of spoilage and contamination. The flavour of foods with a high fat content deteriorates faster than other foods.
<br>9. Frozen foods should be put in the freezer immediately after delivery and only the quantities required should be removed.
<br>10. The freezer should be adequately insulated, well lit and doors should have proper gaskets.
<br>
<br><strong>Blast Freezing
</strong><br>This is a method of rapid deep freezing of packed cooked or uncooked foods by a continuous blast of cold air in a tunnel or chamber at temperatures as low as -40C. Because of the very rapid method of freezing, the quality of the product, i.e., its freshness is preserved. Quick freezing produces very tiny ice crystals in food which do not damage the cells. Once frozen, food should be stored at -20 to -30C.
<br>Slow freezing forms large ice crystals which damage the cells and cause cell juices to drain out.
<br>This results in loss of flavour, colour and nutrients,
<br>The freezer is used to store raw meat, fish, poultry, pork, vegetables like green peas, fruit and fruit pulp, ice cream, etc.
<br>Nowadays, frost-free refrigeration units are becoming popular as they do not require defrosting and can maintain the temperature at —20 to (0 —60 F), Horizontal, vertical and table top models are popularly used in catering establishments like hotels, restaurant« and industrial canteens, ice-cream parlours and fast food centres.
<br>
<br><strong>STORAGE OF SPECIFIC FOODS
</strong><br>
<br>1. Meat and meat products should be refrigerated soon after delivery at zero to 2C (32 to 36F). This temperature minimises and controls bacterial growth if meat is contaminated. Raw meat should be wrapped loosely for better air circulation. Cooked meat should be wrapped tightly. Frozen meats should be wrapped and sealed in moisture-proof paper or containers to prevent freezer burn. Cooked and raw meat should be stored separately. Larger cuts of meat should be hung in the cold room and nothing should be stored below. Trays which collect blood drippings should be washed regularly (once a day).
<br>
<br>2. Poultry is more perishable than meat and should be stored at zero to 2C. Whole dressed birds may be loosely wrapped in wax paper or aluminium foil and refrigerated for three days. Frozen poultry is stored at a temperature of -18C and should be cooked soon after thawing. It should be used within six months after processing.
<br>
<br>3. Eggs should be stored at 4 to 7 c (39 to 45 F). Always refrigerate eggs. Eggs stored in the refrigerator can stay fresh for two weeks as against three days at room temperature.
<br>They should be stored with larger end up. At 20 C, eggs may be stored for 9-10 months. Treatment with pure, colourless, odourless mineral oil increases shelf life by several months. 4. Seafood should be stored at 0C (32F). Fresh fish covered with ice may be stored for three days. Crushed ice should be used as larger pieces bruise the flesh and enhance spoilage. If kept at  0C without ice, then fish should be used within 24 hours.
<br>
<br>5. Dairy products include milk, evaporated and condensed milks, butter, cheese, cream, etc. They readily absorb odours and should be kept away from strong smelling foods.
<br>(a) Fresh milk should be stored in the cold room or refrigerator. Tops and sides of bottles and packets should be washed before storing. Lids of milk urns should be replaced after drawing the required stock. Milk kept at room temperature should not be poured back into refrigerated cartons. Milk should be stored at 3 to 40C for five to seven days.
<br>(b) Milk powder should be stored at 10 to 21 C and can be stored up to one year if not opened. It should be refrigerated after opening.
<br>(c) Butter and other fats (margarine) should be stored at 3 to 4C for two weeks.
<br>
<br>6. Vegetables should be stored at a temperature of 4 to 7C. Onions and potatoes should be stored in ventilated containers in a cool, dry, dark place. Potatoes and other root vegetables should be stored in sacks if purchased in bulk. As vegetables respire, they require ventilated storage. They should be stored on wire racks adequately above ground level. Cabbage and leafy vegetables should be used as soon as they are received or else emptied on the racks and refrigerated. They should be checked thoroughly if they are to be held for a day or two.
<br>
<br><strong>Danger Zone
</strong><br>The food handler should always remember that food cannot be stored indefinitely as all food will ultimately spoil.
<br>Bacteria are present everywhere. Even if one is careful and all attempts are made to prevent contamination, some bacteria will still find their way into food and contaminate it. It is therefore necessary to prevent multiplication and contamination at every step of food preparation with the help of appropriate time-temperature control.
<br>Bacteria multiply over a wide range of temperature. The range of 5 to 63C (41 to 145F) is called the "danger zone" because the hazard of bacterial growth is great within this range. The golden rule of food protection is called time until it is ready to be served and temperature principle. It requires that all potentially hazardous food be kept at an internal temperature below 50C (41 F) or at an internal temperature above 630C (145F) during display and service. If, during periods of preparation, potentially hazardous or high risk foods must be exposed to temperatures between 5 to 63C, this exposure time must be kept to an absolute minimum. The longest period for which food may safely remain in this zone is four hours, but food should not be in the 15 to 490C range for longer than two hours.
