</strong><br>
<br><strong>Toiletries
</strong><br>More and more hotels are opting for toiletry ranges evolved after research and experimentation on the potent healing, curative, and therapeutic properties of herbs, their extracts, and essential oils on the skin and hair, especially as laid down in Ayurveda. These products are also not tested on animals and tend to be biodegradable. Some of the herbs and natural substances frequently used in toiletries such as shampoos, conditioners, creams, lotions, and so on are aloe vera, liquorice, citrus fruit, Indian gooseberry, neem, sunflower, basil, pumpkin, cucumber, turmeric, sandalwood, apricot, mace, clove, nutmeg, coriander, rose, henna, clay (especially China clay), alum, and honey.
<br><br><strong>Textiles
</strong><br>Some international chains and ecotels are experimenting with textiles made of bamboo fibres as an environmentally sustainable material for bed and bath linen and uniforms. Bamboo is one of the world’s most prolific, regenerative crops and is grown without the use of any pesticides or fertilizers. Fabrics made of bamboo are naturally antibacterial and hypoallergenic. Bamboo fibres are usually blended with cotton (65%: 35% or 40%: 60%) to yield more absorbent, softer, and smell resistant luxury bath linen than normal ones. Bamboo fabrics have a unique silky texture and are superior to cotton in terms of softness, durability, and comfort and are therefore ideal for the manufacture of bed linen. The fabrics do not pill. The bamboo fibre under the microscope shows various gaps and holes and hence the fabrics made out of it can rapidly absorb and evaporate moisture, making them exceptionally comfortable. Moreover, bamboo is cool in summer and warm in winter.
<br> 
<br><strong>Energy-conserving Products
</strong><br>Housekeepers are now looking for products and equipment that help conserve energy. One such product is the jet hand-dryer that produces bi-directional jets of cold air jets that come to a head at 68 m/s to leave wet hands bone dry in seconds, in an alternative to the conventional hot-air drying process. The dryer is activated by placing the hands in the dryer bin, whereby the jet starts up automatically. The product’s primary advantage is the enormous power saving due to its low energy consumption compared to the conventional hot-air model: this machine runs at 700W, whereas the conventional hot-air dryers run at 2000W. This leads to huge savings in power bills-often as much as 67 per cent.
<br>Housekeepers and interior designers today also have at their disposal energy-efficient lamps that consume a mere 9W of power and give the same light output as a 60W bulb. This can reduce power tariffs by as much as 80 per cent without taking away the aesthetic appeal of the property. Some trends in lighting that have been gaining momentum in Indian hotels are the use of luminaries and LEDs with sensor technology, compact luminaries and compact halogen lamps.
<br><br>Acids can cause further staining on metals if it is not washed off quickly, and may spoil the glaze on sanitary fitments. Toilet cleansers rely on their acid content to clean and keep the W/C pan hygienic and remove metal stains. They can be crystalline, powdered or liquid.
<br>Powdered toilet cleanser consists of a soluble acidic powder, chlorinated bleach, finely ground abrasive (to help when a brush is used) and an effervescing substance, which helps to spread the active ingredient throughout the water.
<br>Liquid toilet cleaners are a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, and should be used with great care, because the concentration may cause damage to the surface of the pan, it’s surrounding areas, and to the person using it (if the liquid is split).
<br>
<br><strong>ALKALIS:
</strong><br>These are used as cleaning agents in the form of liquids and powders. They are particularly useful in the laundry. Very strong alkalis should be used with utmost caution as they are corrosive and toxic. These are called caustic alkalis. Many alkalis act as bleaches.
<br>Caustic soda- based cleaning agents are used to clear blocked drains and to clean ovens and other industrial equipment.
<br>
<br><strong>ORGANIC SOLVENTS
</strong><br>These are chemicals that dissolve fat, oil, grease, wax or similar compounds from different surface, e.g. methylated spirit, white spirit (turpentine substitute), carbon tetrachloride. The former two are highly inflammable while carbon tetrachloride is harmful if inhaled, and hence should never be used in a closed area. Many are used for routine stain removal. They are harmful to skin and some surfaces and are fire hazardous.
<br>
<br><strong>POLISHES
</strong><br>They do not necessarily clean but produce a shine by providing a smooth surface from which light is reflected evenly. They do this by smoothing out any unevenness on the surface of the article, in many cases by forming a thin layer of wax on the surface, thus giving some protection.
<br><strong><em>Metal polishes –</em></strong> these remove the tarnish resulting from the attack on the metal by certain compounds and some foodstuffs. They are of two basic types, one for hard metal and other for soft. Either type may be liquid or paste. Liquid polish is a fine abrasive waxed with grease solvent, and sometimes with an acid, e.g. plate powder, precipitated whiting, jeweler’s rouge, methylated spirit, and ammonia. Abrasive when rubbed on the surface of the metal provides friction to remove the tarnish and produce a shine.
<br><br><strong><em>Floor polishes –</em></strong>They are of two basic types – Spirit based&nbsp; and Water based.
<br><br><strong><em>Spirit based polishes</em></strong> contain a blend of mainly natural waxes, dispersed in a spirit solvent. They may be in paste or liquid form and contain silicon, but too high a silicon content makes the floor slippery. The build up of polish can be removed by losing the wax finish with spirit and slight abrasion, and then picking up the loosened wax with a damp cloth mop. It is suitable for flooring those that are harmed by water like wood, cork, linoleum, and magnesite.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Water-based polishes </em></strong>are emulsions in which fine particles of natural and synthetic waxes are dispersed in water. They are suitable for use on thermoplastic, rubber, PVC, asphalt and combination floors as spirits can affect them. They can also be used on sealed flooring of wood, cork, magnesite and linoleum. Water-based polishes are always liquid but maybe fully buff able, semi-buff able or dry bright. The build-up polish can be removed by loosening the wax synthetic resin with hot water and alkali – no detergent.
<br>Floor polishes are floor waxes and have to be subjected to rough traffic. A more lasting surface can be obtained by use of a floor seal, with or without water based polish applied on it. Seals are semi-permanent materials, which renders the floor impermeable and protects it from dirt, stains and other foreign matter. They are not polishes.
<br>Furniture polishes are intended for wooden furniture and fittings. They are protective finishes, which provide the surface of the furniture with a thin layer of wax or resin. This layer gives protection against abrasion, absorption of spillages and a smooth surface from which light may be reflected to give a shine or sheen. It consists of waxes dissolved in a varying amount of spirits. They are of four types –
<br>● Paste wax polish – high proportion of wax plus silicon
<br>● Cream polish – greater amounts of spirit to give a cleaning action.
<br>● Liquid polish – has a great proportion of spirit requiring no buffing.
<br>● Spray polish – also has a high proportion of spirit.
<br>
<br><strong>FLOOR SEALERS
</strong><br>These are applied to flooring surfaces as a semi- permanent finish that acts as a protective barrier by preventing the entry of dirt, gems and liquid, grease, stains and bacteria. They prevent scratching and provide an easily maintainable surface. The right type of seal should be applied to each type of floor for effective protection and an attractive appearance. According to their functions, floor sealers can be finishing protective or combination of both.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Types of floor sealers
</em></strong><br>● Oleo-resinous sealers: they are used for imparting an attractive surface gloss penetrating the floor darkening the colour and highlighting the grain of wood floors.
<br>● One-pot plastic sealers: they are used on wood, wood- composition, cork and magnesite floors.
<br>● Two-pot plastic sealers: they are also used on wood, wood- composition, cork and magnesite floors.
<br>● Pigmented sealers: these may be used on concrete, wood, wood-composition, magnesite, asphalt, and stone floors.
<br>● water-based seals: these may be used on marble , terrazzo, magnesite, linoleum, rubber, thermoplastic tiles, PVCs, asphalt, concrete, stone-, and quarry tiles.
<br>
<br><strong>BLEACHES
</strong><br>Bleaches used for cleaning purposes are generally alkaline stabilized solutions of sodium hypochlorite and are useful for stained sinks, W/C pans, etc, but they must never be mixed with other types of toilet cleansers. They whiten and have germicidal properties. Great care should be taken to prevent spotting on other surfaces.
<br>
<br><strong>DIS-INFECTANTS AND DEODORANTS
</strong><br>Disinfectants, antiseptics and deodorants are not strictly cleaning agents, but are often used during the cleaning operations. Disinfectants kill bacteria; antiseptics prevent bacterial growth and are frequently diluted disinfectants. Use of disinfectants should not be necessary if the cleaning methods are correct.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Types of disinfectants:</em></strong>
<br>Disinfectants can be categorized in terms of their chemical action and compositions
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Phenols:</em></strong> these are hydroxyl derivatives of the aromatic hydrocarbon benzene. They are used in dilute or high concentrations to disinfect surfaces in hospitals especially in hotels, diluted phenols are used with their sharp smell masked by other additives.
<br><strong><em>● Halogens: </em></strong>the elements chlorine and iodine may be used as disinfectants .Chlorine is used both as bleach and as a disinfectant on many surfaces .Iodine is not often used to disinfectant surfaces because it tends to leave brown stains.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Quaternary ammonium compounds:</em></strong> these are cationic surfactants useful as bactericides.
<br>Natural pine oils: pine oils are obtained from pine trees. They are germicidal to some extent, but are mainly added changing formulation for their pleasant smell.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Deodorants</em></strong> mask unpleasant smells by either combining chemically with the particle causing smell, or by their smell being predominant. This is not required where there is good ventilation and thorough cleaning.
<br>They are used in restrooms, guestrooms, guest bathrooms, cloakrooms and public areas such as lobbies. Some deodorizers leave no trace of a perfume cover- up. They are usually available as aerosol sprays, Liquids, powders and crystalline blocks.
<br>
<br><strong>WINDOW OR GLASS CLEANSERS
</strong><br>Window cleansers consist of water-miscible solvents, often isopropyl alcohol, to which small quantities of surfactants and possibly an alkali are added to improve the polishing effect of the cleanser. Some also contain fine abrasives. Most glass cleaners are available as sprays or liquid. They are sprayed directly onto windows, mirrors and other glass surfaces or applied on with a soft cloth and rubbed off using a soft, lint- free glass cloth. An inexpensive glass cleaner that can be readily made in the housekeeping department is soft water to which some vinegar is added can be used with old newspapers.
<br>
<br><strong>ABSORBENTS
</strong><br>They carry out the action by absorbing the stain or grease. They are used only when the quantity of stain is too much. E.g. starch powder, fuller’s earth, bran, French chalk powder, etc.
