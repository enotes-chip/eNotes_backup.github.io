</strong><br>Eggs are one of the most nutritious and versatile foods in the kitchen and are served on their own, used as an ingredient in many dishes starting from soup to desserts. It provides texture, structure, flavour and moisture as well as the nutrition. Eggs can be brown or white; colour has no effect on quality or flavour but depends on the breed of the hen.
<br>
<br><strong>Nutritional Value
</strong><br>The nutritional value of eggs varies with their size; it is not an important factor in judging their quality. Larger the eggs, of course, have more food value than small ones. A single large egg provides 6.5grm of protein or about 13% of the recommended daily intake for adults, as well as 80 calories and a good amount of iron, phosphorus, thiamine and vitamins like A, D, E and K. 
<br>
<br>The disadvantage of egg as a staple diet is their high cholesterol content. The yolk of an egg is about 50% water,34%lipids, fats and related substances and 16% protein with traces of glucose and minerals. 
<br>
<br><strong>Significance
</strong><br>Eggs are essential to all kinds of cooking, not only in the preparation but as food in their own right. They produce meals that are economical in price, and with a minimum of waste and time. By the term egg we mean those of the domestic hen, but these are not the only edible eggs. There are those of ducks, geese, turkeys, also of wild birds such as plovers and gulls.
<br>
<br>An egg has been described as a “Complete Food” because they are highly nutritious and used in a range of recipes. Yolks and eggs are used separately.&nbsp; In all culinary preparations, eggs are used for binding, coloring, enriching, increasing volume, coating, etc.
<br>
<br>
