</strong><br>Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Table sugar, granulated sugar, or regular sugar, refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.
<br><br>Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond. Common examples are sucrose (table sugar) (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.
<br><br>Sugar occurs naturally in almost all plant structures. However, for general and commercial purposes, it is obtained from two major sources:
<br>•<strong><em> Sugarcane
</em></strong><br>• <strong><em>Sugar Beet
</em></strong><br><br>Sugar is not only added to food for taste, but also for functional reasons.Sugar alternatives or low sugar foods may not be healthier.Removing sugar can be technically challenging.
<br> Important roles of sugar
<br>Aside from making some foods more palatable and providing kilojoules, sugar has many important properties that contribute uniquely to a food’s appearance, texture, and shelf-life. It’s, therefore, an important ingredient in both the foods we make at home and the manufactured foods on our supermarket shelves. Reducing or removing sugar from a product often requires replacement with several substitute ingredients to achieve the same quality, taste and texture profile.
<br><br>Let’s see some major roles:
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>As a bulking agent
</strong><br>Sugar contributes to the texture of food, such as in meringue and biscuits. This is an important role of sugar in most baking applications.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>As a preservative
</strong><br>Sugar helps to prevent or slow the growth of bacteria, molds, and yeast in jams and other preserves. It also helps to prolong the shelf life of many foods on our supermarket shelves by acting as a humectant – maintaining and stabilizing the water content in foods.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Enhancing flavor
</strong><br>Adding a little sugar to nutritious foods such as sour fruits (frozen berries or rhubarb), or porridge, helps to make them more palatable. Sugar also enhances fruit flavors in foods.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>For color
</strong><br>On heating, sugar breaks down to produce the color and desirable flavor that characterizes many cooked foods. This is caused by sugars reacting with proteins as they break down in the cooking process, called the Maillard reaction. A sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon on top of fruit muffins makes for a browned crunchy topping and gives a nice texture.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Adds viscosity
</strong><br>Sugar provides body in drinks and semi-liquid foods like syrups, chutneys, and sweet sauces.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>As an anticoagulant
</strong><br>When it’s heated, sugar delays the coagulation of proteins (change in liquid form to solid or semi-solid form), such as in baked custards and other desserts.
<br> 
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF SUGAR
</strong><br>Sugar may be classified under one or a combination of the following: -
<br>• The source (sugarcane or sugar beet)
<br>• The country of origin
<br>• The method of processing which in turn will determine the type of sugar produced, e.g.: cube sugar, powdered sugar
<br>• The chemical group – sugars may be classified into two chemical groups Monosaccharides &amp; disaccharides
<br> 
<br><strong>MARKET FORMS OF SUGAR
</strong><br>Commercially; sugar is available in two forms:
<br>• Solid
<br>• Liquid
<br> 
<strong><br>SOLID FORMS</strong>
<br> 
<br><strong>1.    Granulated sugar:</strong> By far the most important sugar product on the market and is also known as sucrose. Granulated sugar is marketed as fine (the type most commonly used) or ultra-fine (used in the making of cakes and instant beverages).
<br><strong>2.   Powdered sugar:</strong> This is obtained from granulated sugar, through the process of pulverization. It is available in various degrees of fineness depending on the purpose that it is used for.
<br><strong>3.    Brown sugar:</strong> It is composed of sugar crystals which are suspended in flavoured and coloured molasses syrup and is often referred to as demerara sugar. Demerara sugar is brown sugar that comes from demerara in the WestIndies.
<br><strong> 4.   Cube sugar:</strong> This is ultra-fine granulated sugar which is compressed into small individual portion sized cubes. Very popular in fine dining restaurants. Sometimes it is made out of powdered sugar as well.
<br><strong>5.   Icing sugar:</strong> This is powdered sugar which has a small percentage of cornflour worked into the mixture. It gives a much smoother texture to the final product and as the name suggests, it’s used to produce various icings.
<br><strong> 6.   Maltose: </strong>Also known as malt sugar is used as a sweetener, flavouring and colouring agent. It is also used in the manufacture of beer besides being used in malt beverages, instant beverages, milk shakes and candy.
<br><strong>7.    Lactose:</strong> Lactose is commercially extracted from solutions of whey, by crystallization. It is added to bakery products because its presence contributes to the surface browning of baked products.
<br><strong>8.    Invert sugar:</strong> Invert sugars are desirable in baked products and in candies because they resist crystallization and also retain their moisture.
<br> 
<br><strong> LIQUID FORMS
</strong><br>Liquid sugars are available in the form of syrups. These syrups are liquid containing large amounts of sugar. Syrups can have a variety of flavors that make them a useful addition to other foods. The most frequently used syrups are:
<br> 
<br><strong>1. Molasses:</strong> known commonly here in India as jaggery (gur), but in the liquid form. It is a by-product of the sugar industry (sugarcane). However, black jaggery is obtained from the date palm and is also referred to as palm jaggery. In the manufacture of sugar from cane, the sugar goes through various stages of crystallization and refinement. The leftovers and by products are used to produce molasses.
<br><strong>2. Maple syrup:</strong> Maple syrup is obtained from the sap of mature sugar maple trees. The characteristic flavour of maple syrup is obtained from the volatile oils in the sap that is then concentrated by boiling. Maple syrup is very popular in the USA where it is popularly served with flapjacks (American pancakes). It is also popular in Canada and the maple leaf even figures on the Canadian flag.
<br><strong>3. Honey:</strong> is made by bees from the nectar of flowers and is stored for future use in cell-like structures called honeycombs. One property of honey that is very useful in cookery and bakery is its ability to retain water. Cakes and cookies that have honey as an ingredient will retain their moisture for a fairly longer time.
<br><strong>4. Corn syrup:</strong> Is used mainly to sweeten foods in the commercial production of foodstuffs. Corn syrup is a liquid sweetener consisting mainly of glucose or dextrose. It is made by converting cornstarch into simple sugar compounds by the use of enzymes.
<br><strong>5. High fructose corn syrup: </strong>This product is being used increasingly in commercial food production because of its intense sweetness. It is used in the manufacture of soft drink concentrates, fruit squashes, candy and some bakery products.
<br><strong> 6. Glucose:</strong> is present in fruits in the natural form but commercially is sold as dextrose. It is used extensively in the commercial production of candy. It is also used widely in making Icings like gum paste, pastillage and such products.
<br> 
<br><strong>FUNCTIONS OF SUGAR
</strong><br><strong>1. </strong>As a sweetener in products such as cakes, cold drinks and commonly in tea and coffee.
<br><strong>2. </strong>To soften gluten in flour and to make baked products more tender to eat and lighter in texture.
<br><strong>3. </strong>To colour baked products such as the crust of bread.
<br><strong>4. </strong>To retain moisture and prevent baked products in particular from drying out quickly.
<br><strong>5. </strong>To act as a preservative in jams, marmalades and canned fruit.
<br><strong>6. </strong>To help as an activator. Sugar helps yeast to grow faster by providing it with a readily available source of food and nourishment.
<br><strong>7. </strong>As an anticoagulant, sugar helps to delay the coagulation of protein in eggs.
<br><strong>8.</strong> It is used as the main ingredient in icings and candies.
<br> 
<br><strong>Cooking of sugar various-stages
</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong><em>There are 7 stages of cooking sugar.&nbsp;</em></strong><br>• <strong>Thread:</strong>  Cooked to 230° to 234° F. The syrup spins a soft, loose, short thread.
<br>•   <strong>Soft Ball:</strong>  Cooked to 234° to 240° F.  The syrup forms a soft, pliable, sticky ball.
<br>•  <strong>Firm Ball:</strong>  Cooked to 244° to 248° F. The syrup forms a firm, but still pliable, sticky ball.
<br>•  <strong>Hard Ball:</strong>  Cooked to 250° to 265° F. The syrup forms a hard, sticky ball.
<br>•  <strong>Soft Crack:</strong>  Cooked to 270° to 290° F. The syrup forms longer strands that are firm, but yet remain pliable.
<br>•  <strong>Hard Crack:</strong>  Cooked to 300° to 310° F. The syrup forms stiff strands that are firm and brittle.
<br>•  <strong>Caramel:</strong>  Cooked to 320° to 338° F. The syrup changes color, ranging from a light golden to a dark amber brown. It forms hard strands that are firm and brittle.
<br>
<br><strong>What is caramelization
</strong><br>Caramelization is the browning of sugar, a process used extensively in cooking for the resulting sweet nutty flavor and brown color. Caramelization is a type of non-enzymatic browning reaction. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals are released producing the characteristic caramel flavor. The reaction involves the removal of water (as steam) and the breakdown of the sugar. 
<br>
<br>The caramelization reaction depends on the type of sugar. Sucrose and glucose caramelize around 160°C (320°F) and fructose caramelizes at 110°C (230°F)
<br>
<br><strong>How To Caramelize Sugar
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Ingredients
</strong><br>• 1 cup granulated sugar
<br>• 2 tablespoons water
<br>• Drop of lemon juice, fresh-squeezed <em>(optional)
</em><br>
<br><strong>Instructions
</strong><br>• In a heavy-bottom, high-sided saucepan over low to medium-low heat, combine 1 cup sugar, water, and a drop of lemon juice (the lemon juice keeps the mixture from hardening). 
<br>
<br>• Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until sugar dissolves and mixture just begins to simmer.  Sugar melts at about 320° F. and will turn to a clear liquid at that temperature.
<br>
<br>• After sugar dissolves and syrup is simmering, cook for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, without stirring.  Hold the handle of the pan and gently tilt the pan off the heat to distribute color evenly as sugar caramelizes.  NOTE:  Boiling times will vary according to different stove tops and other factors.
<br>
<br>• If using a digital instant-read thermometer, the temperature on your cooking thermometer should register a final temperature of approximately 340 to 350° F. and the syrup should have a golden brown (light amber) color.  Watch the changing of the color and the temperature carefully as it can go past the light brown stage quickly and burn. 
<br>
<br>• The mechanism of caramelization development involves many steps starting with carbohydrates (reducing mono- and di-saccharides) decomposition, dehydration and degradation, followed by the formation of small molecules, a lag phase and eventual condensation or polymerization to form  complex molecules of varying molecular weights. 
<br>
<br>The exact type of products formed is dependent on the sugar chemistry as well as process conditions such as temperature, pH, water activity among others. Caramelization of sucrose, for example, can be divided into the following stages:
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>First stage – </strong>thermal decomposition and fragmentation to yield glucose and fructose. These sugars can individually lose water and react with each other.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Second stage –</strong> isomerization of fragmented sugars (aldoses to ketoses) and further elimination of water to form the sugars’ anhydro forms.
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Third stage  –</strong> additional fragmentation, polymerization and subsequent formation of volatile flavor compounds such as furan, maltol, ethyl acetate, diacetyl, etc. as well as brown colored compounds such as caramel.
