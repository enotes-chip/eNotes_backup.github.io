</strong><br>Vegetables refers to all plants or plants which can be eaten raw, cooked or preserved in some form. Vegetables are of great importance in our diet and especially with regard to the present trend when the people are shifting towards the vegetarian side. This plays a very important role in our diet to: properly choose, properly cooked or raw.
<br>They make an invaluable contribution towards the supply of vitamins and minerals whenever possible. We should serve two vegetables in our diet, also salads should be given importance and hence must be included in both the meals. Generally vegetables have high water content, which ranges from 70-90%.
<br>
<br><strong>NUTRITIONAL AND OTHER BENEFITS OBTAIN FROM VEGETABLES
</strong><br>Vegetables contain a good amount of vitamins and minerals. All the green,yellow, orange vegetables are rich sources of calcium, magnesium,potassium, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin A and vitamin K.
<br>Vegetables contain soluble as well as insoluble dietary fibres like cellulose,gums,pectin etc. Here, few examples:
<br><br>● Green beans : low in calories and contain no saturated fat but good source of vitamin, minerals and fibres.
<br>● Cauliflower: low in calories, low in fat and no cholesterol.
<br>● Bell pepper: fresh bell pepper is a rich source of vitamin C and also contains a good level of vitamin A.
<br>● Beetroot: low in calorie and fat but rich in dietary fibres, vitamins, and minerals.
<br>● Bitter gourd: rich in dietary fibres, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants.
<br>● Carrot: rich source of carotenoids and vitamins A.
<br>● Cucumber: it is a very good source of potassium.
<br>
<br><strong>Reasons for which vegetables are cooked
</strong><br>● to soften the product
<br>● to improve the flavour
<br>● to improve the palatability
<br>● to increase the digestibility
<br>● to preserve the vegetables
<br>
<br><strong>Effects of heat on vegetables
</strong><br>Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safer to eat, digestible and more palatable. Cooking also changes the appearance of the food. Heat breaks down the starches present; changes and blend flavour within the food,and also destroy bacteria in order to make food digestible.
<br><br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>CARBOHYDRATES: </em></strong>CARAMELIZATION AND GELATINIZATION. Both sugar and starch are carbohydrates. Caramelization is browning of sugars and vegetables get softened by the gelatinization of the starch.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>VEGETABLE FIBRES :</em></strong> Fibres are a group of complex substances that give structure and firmness to plants. They cannot be digested. Heat breaks down the fibers. Alkali makes fibres softer but makes them mushy and loses essential vitamins.
<br><strong><em>MINERALS,VITAMINS,PIGMENTS,AND FLAVOUR COMPONENTS:</em></strong> minerals dissolve in water during cooking. Vitamins and pigments may also be destroyed by prolonged cooking. Pigment and flavour may also determine whether the food is appetizing enough to eat or not.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>PROTEIN:</em></strong> when heat is applied to protein they become firm or they start to coagulate with heat. Protein becomes tough and dry when exposed to high heat.
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES
</strong><br><strong>1. Brassica :</strong> Brassica or the cabbage family consists of vegetables used their head, leaves or flowers are mostly used in broths ad braised dishes to accompany meats such as cabbage, cauliflower
<br>
<br><strong>2. Fruit Vegetables :</strong> These are the fruit of flowering plants. They also contain seeds such as Tomato, brinjal
<br>
<br><strong>3. Gourds &amp; squashes :</strong> The gourds are classified into summer and winter squashes. The long trailing vines of complex root systems bear this vegetables adorned by large leaves and attractive flowers such as bottle and ridged gourd, butternut squash.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Greens :</strong> This refers to vegetables that are leafy and eaten cooked with the exception of lettuce. Most of the greens are mildly spiced and slightly strong flavoured such as spinach and radicchio.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Fungus :</strong> Although not real vegetables, fungus is a plant that has no seed, steam or flower. It’s commonly known as mushroom. Always mushroom should select carefully. Mushrooms like button and shitake mushrooms.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Roots &amp; Tubers :</strong> Though roots and tubers are the same however, scientifically speaking tubers are fat underground stems whereas roots are the single bulbs which extend into the ground supplies the plant. The tubers would be more starchy. Root vegetable such as carrot and radish and Tubers such as Potatoes
<br>
<br><strong>7. Pods &amp; seeds :</strong> In some vegetables, only seeds are eaten such as in case of peas, corn and pulses
<br><br><strong>8. Stems : </strong>Also known as stalk vegetables, they have the highest percentage of cellulose fibre and are usually eaten when they are young &amp; tender such as celery.
<br><br><strong>9. Baby Vegetables : </strong>This is a very modern classification of vegetables that include vegetables created with hybrid varieties  or are picked up before maturity such as baby carrots, corns and potato.<br>
<br>
<br><strong>PIGMENTS AND COLOUR CHANGES
</strong><br>Pigments: Six major pigments are in the vegetables:
<br>
<br>● <strong>Chlorophyll:</strong> it is present in all green coloured vegetables such as cabbage, spinach, green beans, broccoli, peas etc. 
<br>● <strong>Carotenoids:</strong> it is present in orange coloured vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, corns, tomatoes etc
<br>● <strong>Flavones:</strong> it is present in white coloured vegetables such as cauliflower, turnips, potatoes, onion etc.
<br>● <strong>Anthocyanins:</strong> it is present in red &amp; purple coloured vegetables. Beet roots, red cabbage (not tomatoes).
<br>● <strong>Betalains:</strong> it is present in purplish red and some are in yellow vegetables such as beetroot
<br>● <strong>Anthoxanthin:</strong> it is present in whilte or colourless vegetables like flavonoids
<br>
<br><strong>CONTROLLING THE COLOUR &amp; NUTRIENT OF THE VEGETABLES
</strong><br>It is a challenge for the chefs to ensure that the colour of the vegetables is appetizing, even when the vegetables are fully cooked. Application of excessive heat can have adverse effects on the colour of the vegetables. The knowledge of pigments and the effect of alkali or acid on a particular vegetable help the chef to decide how to cook the vegetable to ensure that the colour is retained or is brightened to enhance the appearance without compromising on the texture and flavour of the ingredient. <br><br>Few things that the chef can keep in mind to control the colour of the vegetables while cooking are:
<br><br>● Cook vegetables, keeping in mind the pigments they contain and how the pigments react in the presence of heat, alkali, and acidic medium. For example, cook spinach uncovered as we want the acids to evaporate out and not discolour the chlorophyll pigment present in spinach.
<br>● Cook the vegetables in hot salted water for a brief time and wherever possible, drain and refresh in cold water to brighten the colour.
<br>● Blanch the vegetables first before applying methods of cooking such as sautéing, frying, or grilling.
<br>● Cut the vegetables into smaller pieces to ensure that the cooking period is brief. This helps in retention of the colour of the vegetables.
<br>● Avoid cooking on high heat or temperature
<br>● Longer duration of cooking
<br>● Too much of liquid that causes leaching; and
<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water).
<br>● Use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, high heat causes some nutrient loss.
<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time. 
<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering; but high heat can destroy the vegetable. Avoid adding too much liquid or alkali (baking soda, hard water).
<br>
<br><strong>Various Rules For Vegetable Preparation
</strong><br>● Do not let the vegetable soak in water unless necessary.
<br>● Wash the vegetables just before peeling.
<br>● Cook or bake the vegetable in their skin.
<br>● Use the minimum amount of liquid during boiling.
<br>● Use the water in which the vegetables are boiled (pot liquor).
<br>● Use the correct cooking medium which can be acidic, alkali or neutral.
<br>● Cut the vegetable as near to the cooking time as possible.
<br>● Serve the food as soon as it is ready for the service.
<br>● Keep the oxygen away from the vitamin-rich foods by covering them with water.
<br>● For uniform doneness, cut into uniform sizes before cooking.
<br> ● If the vegetables must be cooked in advance, slightly undercook them, cool rapidly in cold water, drain and refrigerate, then reheat to order.
<br><br>
<br><strong>STANDARD VEGETABLES CUTS
</strong><br>● Brunoise : vegetables are cut into fine dice.
<br>● Macedoine : vegetables are cut into ½ cm dices.
<br>● Julienne: vegetables are cut into very thin strips (1 ½ ’’long)
<br>● Jardinière: vegetables are cut into baton shape (1’’’x ¼ ’’ x ¼ ’’).
<br>● Paysanne : vegetables are cut into small triangles, circles and squares- uniform shape.
<br>● Wedges : tomato or lemon cut into four or six pieces.
<br>● Chiffonade : shredded leafy vegetables.
<br>● Matignon : evenly cut root vegetables.
<br>● Chateau : turning of vegetables into barrel shape.&nbsp;<br></p>
