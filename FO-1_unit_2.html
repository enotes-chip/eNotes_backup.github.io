                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>The hotel industry has grown to its present form by modifying itself with respect to services, architectural design, and care for its guests. The hotels/inns in the olden days only provided the basic need of shelter, and standards of hygiene and sanitation were almost non-existent. The modern hotel provides a clean, hygienic, and well-appointed room with excellent services to its guests. The industry is so diverse and specialized that each hotel has to have a unique selling proposition to survive in the business and also make a profit. Every hotel tries to establish itself as unique, offering the best service to its guests. The classification of hotels helps tourists select a hotel that meets their requirements. 
<br>
<br>The need for the classification of hotels was felt more with the advent of mass tourism. In order to provide travelers, an idea of the type of accommodation they offered, many private clubs, agencies, and travel associations came up with descriptions of their lodging properties in specified regions. Gradually, the governments, national and state tourism organizations, and associations of industries with stakes in the hospitality business, realizing the significance of this, backed the idea and set the standards for various hotel categories. In a nutshell, hotel classification serves the following purposes: 
<br>
<br><strong>• </strong>Lends uniformity in services and sets general standards of a hotel.
<br>• Provides an idea regarding the range and type of hotels available within a . geographical location.
<br>• Acts as a measure of control over hotels with respect to the quality of services offered in each category.
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF HOTELS AND OTHER TYPES OF LODGING
</strong><br>Hotels provide accommodation, along with services like food and beverages, and facilities like recreation, conference, and training arrangements, and organization of official or private parties. Each hotel has unique features associated with it. The features may be its location; a number of guest rooms; special services such as concierge, travel assistance, and valet parking; facilities such as speciality restaurants, bars, business meeting venues, swimming pools, and so on. The diversity in services and facilities provided by each hotel makes it quite difficult to have any single basis of classification of hotels, and if we classify them on different criteria there will be some hotels that will fall into more than one group. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Hotel Classifications by: 
</em></strong><br>» Star Rating 
<br>» Size 
<br>» Type of Clientele 
<br>» Level of Services 
<br>» Ownership 
<br>» Duration of Guest Stay 
<br>» Location <br>
<br><strong>1. Classification on the Basis of Star
</strong><br>The star classification system is among the most widely accepted ratings of hotels worldwide. Ratings of hotels in different countries are done by the government or quasi-government sources, independent rating agencies, or sometimes the hotel operators themselves. The Indian hotel industry follows the star rating system, which indicates the number and standard of facilities offered by the hotel. The classification of hotels is done by a central government committee called the Hotel Restaurant Approval and Classification Committee (HRACC), which inspects and assesses the hotels based on the facilities and services offered. The classification committee includes the Chairman (HRACC) and other members chosen from the government and industry associations such as the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India (FHRAI), Hotel Association of India (HAI), Indian Association of Tour Operators (JATO), Travel Agents Association of India (T AAI), or Institute of Hotel Management Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition (IHM). In the case of the Heritage category, a representative of the Indian Heritage Hotel Association (IHHA) is included in the committee. The committee visits the hotels and evaluates the facilities and services of the hotels before the grade is awarded.
<br>
<br><strong>Star Rating 
</strong><br><strong>‣</strong> One Star
<br><strong>‣</strong> Two Star
<br><strong>‣</strong> Three Star
<br><strong>‣</strong> Four Star
<br><strong>‣</strong> Five Star
<br><strong>‣</strong> Five Star Deluxe
<br>
<br><strong>Heritage Hotels</strong> 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Heritage Classic
<br><strong>‣</strong> Heritage 
<br>‣ Heritage Grand 
<br>
<br><strong>One-star Hotels</strong> These properties are generally small and independently owned, with a family atmosphere. There may be a limited range of facilities and the meals may be fairly simple. For example, lunch may not be served or some bedrooms may not have an en suite bath or shower. However, maintenance, cleanliness, and comfort would be of an acceptable standard. 
<br>
<br><strong>Two-star Hotels</strong> In this class, hotels will typically be small to medium-sized and offer more extensive facilities than one-star hotels. Guests can expect comfortable, well-equipped overnight accommodation, usually with an en suite bath or shower. Reception and other staff will aim for a more professional presentation than at the one-star level and will offer a wider range of straightforward services, including food and beverages. 
<br>
<br><strong>Three-star Hotels</strong> At this level, hotels are usually of a size to support higher staffing levels as well as significantly higher quality and range of facilities than at the lower star classifications. Reception and other public areas will be more spacious, and the restaurant will normally also cater to non-residents. All bedrooms will have an en suite bath and shower and will offer a good standard of comfort and equipment, such as a direct-dial telephone and toiletries in the bathroom. Besides room service, some provisions for business travelers can be expected. 
<br>
<br><strong>Four Star Hotels</strong> Expectations at this level include a degree of luxury as well as quality in the furnishings, decor, and equipment in every area of the hotel. Bedrooms will also usually offer more space than at the lower star levels. They will be well-designed with coordinated furnishings and decor. The en suite bathrooms will have both a bath and shower. There will be a high staff to guest ratio, with provisions of porter service, twenty-four-hour room service, and laundry and dry-cleaning services. The restaurant will demonstrate a serious approach to its cuisine. 
<br>
<br><strong>Five-star Hotels</strong> Five-star hotels offer spacious and luxurious accommodations throughout the hotel, matching the best international standards. The interior design should impress with its quality and attention to detail, comfort, and elegance. The furnishings should be immaculate. The service should be formal, well-supervised, and flawless in its attention to guest’s needs, without being intrusive. The restaurant will demonstrate a high level of technical skill. The staff will be knowledgeable, helpful, and well versed in all aspects of customer care, combining efficiency with courtesy. 
<br>
<br><strong>Heritage Hotels 
</strong><br>A recent addition to the hotel industry in the country, heritage hotels are properties set in small forts, palaces, or Havelis, the mansions of erstwhile royal and aristocratic families. They have added a new dimension to cultural tourism. In a heritage hotel, a visitor is offered rooms that have their own history, is served traditional cuisine toned down to the requirements of international palates, is entertained by folk artists, can participate in activities that allow a glimpse into the heritage of the region, and can bask in an atmosphere that lives and breathes of the past. Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur and The Oberoi Cecil in Shimla are examples of heritage hotels. 
<br><br>According to the Ministry of Tourism, the heritage hotels are further subdivided as follows: 
<br>
<br><strong>Heritage</strong> This category covers hotels in residences, Havelis, hunting lodges, castles, or forts and palaces built between 1935 and 1950. 
<br>
<br><strong>Heritage Classic</strong> This category covers hotels in residences, Havelis, hunting lodges, castles, or forts and palaces built prior to 1935 but after 1920. 
<br>
<br><strong>Heritage Grand</strong> This category covers hotels in residences, Havelis, hunting lodges, castles, or forts and palaces built prior to 1920. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>2. Classification on the Basis of Size</strong>
<br>The number of guest rooms in a hotel is a criterion to classify hotels. Hotels can be grouped into the following categories on the basis of the number of rooms or the size of the hotel: 
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Small
<br><strong>‣</strong> Medium
<br><strong>‣</strong> Large
<br><strong>‣</strong> Very Large
<br>
<br><strong>Small Hotels</strong> In India, hotels with twenty-five rooms or less are classified as small hotels, e.g., Hotel Alka, New Delhi, and The Oberoi Vanyavilas, Ranthambore. However, in the developed countries of Europe and America, hotels with less than 100 rooms are considered small. These hotels provide clean and comfortable accommodation but may not provide upmarket facilities, such as a swimming pool, restaurant, bar, etc. 
<br>
<br><strong>Medium Hotels</strong> Hotels with twenty-six to a hundred rooms are called medium hotels, e.g., Hotel Taj View, Agra, and Chola Sheraton Hotel, Chennai. However, in developed nations, hotels with up to 300 rooms are termed medium-sized. 
<br>
<br><strong>Large Hotels</strong> In India, hotels with 101 to 300 guest rooms are regarded as large hotels, e.g., The Imperial, New Delhi, and The Park, Kolkata. Whereas, hotels with 400-600 rooms are termed as large hotels in the developed world.
<br>
<br><strong>Very Large Hotels</strong> Hotels with more than 300 guest rooms are known as very large hotels in our country, e.g., Shangri-La Hotel, New Delhi, and Leela Kempinski, Mumbai. In developed nations, hotels with 600-1,000 rooms may be considered very large. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>3. Classification on the Basis of Location</strong> 
<br>The location of the hotel is one of the major criteria for a traveler to select and patronize a hotel. Hotels may be located in the city center, sub-urban areas, natural locations such as hill stations and sea beaches, near the port of entry into a country, etc. They may be classified into the following categories on the basis of their location.
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Downtown Hotel 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Sub-urban Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Resort 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Airport Hotel 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Motel 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Floatel 
<br>
<br><strong>Downtown Hotel</strong> A downtown hotel is located in the center of the city or within a short distance from the business center, shopping areas, theatres, public offices, etc. The center of the city may not necessarily be the geographical center, but it refers to an area that·is considered to be the commercial hub of the city. The room rates in these hotels may be higher than similar hotels in other areas, so as to cover the huge investment made on the land. They are generally preferred by business clientele as they find it convenient to stay close to the place of their business activities. Hotel InterContinental, New Delhi, and Hotel Le Meridien, Pune are examples of downtown hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Sub-urban Hotel</strong> As the land cost in the city center is higher and the space is limited, some entrepreneurs build their hotels near the outskirts of the city. Providing similar facilities as the downtown hotels, these hotels are set in sub­urban areas and have the advantage of quieter surroundings. Such hotels are ideal for people who prefer to stay away from the hustle and bustle of a city. The duration of the stay of guests in these hotels may be longer than at a hotel located in the city. The room rates in such hotels are moderate and may attract budget travelers. Trident Hotel, Gurgaon, and Uppal's Orchid, New Delhi are examples of suburban hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Resort Hotel</strong> Hotels that are located at tourist destinations such as hill stations, sea beaches, and the countryside are referred to as resort hotels. These hotels have a very calm and natural ambiance. They are mostly away from cities and are located in pollution-free environs. The room rates in these hotels may range from moderate to high, depending on the additional services offered. These hotels combined stay facilities with leisure activities such as golf, summer and winter sports, etc. Some of these hotels are projected as dream destinations for guests who wish to enjoy the beauty of nature and have a memorable holiday. The occupancy in resorts is normally higher during vacation time and weekends when guests want to take a break from their weekly routine. Taj Fort Aguada Beach Resort, Goa, and Wildflower Hall in the Himalayas, Shimla are examples of resort hotels.
<br>
<br><strong>Airport Hote</strong>l Airport Hotels are situated in the vicinity of the airport and other ports of entry. Offering all the services of a commercial hotel, these hotels are generally patronized by the passengers who need a stopover en route their journey. Hotel Centaur, Mumbai, and Radisson, New Delhi are examples of airport hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Motel</strong> The word motel is formed by merging two words motor and hotel. They are located primarily on highways and provide modest lodging to highway travelers. A motel offers facilities such as accommodations, food and drinks, garage facilities, a parking lot, and re-fuelling for vehicles. E.g: Motel Aaram, Kannur, Kerala 
<br>
<br><strong>Floatels</strong> Floatels are types of lodging properties that float on the surface of the water. This category consists of all lodgings properties that are built on the top of rats or semi-submersible platforms and includes cruise liners and houseboats. Some of them provide luxurious accommodation, along with food and beverage facilities to guests. The houseboats of Dal Lake (Shikara) in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir are some examples of Floatels in India.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>4. Classification on the Basis of Clientele</strong>
<br>Hotels cater to the needs of their guests. Every individual or a group of people who patronize a hotel has a different set of requirements. While some would prefer luxurious accommodation, others would like to stay in a simple and cheap room. Some would require facilities such as meeting rooms, business centers, and conference halls if their travel is business-oriented. Being a capital-intensive industry, the diversities in guest requirements discourage hotels from catering to all types of travelers. As a result, hotels choose to carve out a niche for themselves by catering to the needs of specific guest segments. Hotels can be classified into the following categories on the basis of their clientele
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Business or Commercial
<br><strong>‣</strong> Transient Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Suite Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Residential Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Bed and Breakfast
<br><strong>‣</strong> Casino Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Conference Centres
<br><strong>‣</strong> Convention Hotels
<br>
<br><strong>Business or Commercial Hotel</strong> Designed to cater to the business traveler, com­mercial hotels are generally situated in the city center.

They also provide in-house secretarial services, as well as facilities such as letter drafting, typing, fax, and photocopying of documents for the convenience of their guests. The guest amenities at commercial hotels may include complimentary newspapers, morning coffee, cable television, and access to channeled music and movies. The duration of guest stay is generally very short at these hotels. The occupancy level is higher during the weekdays and slightly lower during weekends. These hotels are also known as downtown hotels. The Park and Hotel InterContinental in New Delhi are examples of business or commercial hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Transient Hotel</strong> Transient hotels cater to the needs of people who are on the move and need a stopover en route their journey. Located in the close proximity of ports of entry, such as seaport, airport, and major railway stations, these hotels are normally patronized by transient travelers. They have round-the-clock operational room service and coffee shops and offer all the facilities of a commercial hotel. Transient hotels are usually five-star, and their target market includes business clientele, airline passengers with overnight travel layovers or canceled flights, and airline personnel. The occupancy rate is usually very high, sometimes more than 100 percent, as rooms can be sold more than once on a given day. Hotel Centaur and Radisson in New Delhi are examples of transient hotels in India. Airport hotels fall under this category. 
<br>
<br><strong>Suite Hotel</strong> Suite hotels provide the highest level of personalized services to guests. The guest rooms generally comprise a living area, a compact kitchenette, complete with a refrigerator and a microwave, a bedroom attached with a bathroom, and sometimes even a dance floor.

Guest rooms generally include a sitting room, bedroom, and small kitchenette. They are akin to small individual apartments. These hotels may have a fully operational restaurant or a dining room for the resident guests and may provide services such as daily housekeeping, telephone, front desk, and uniformed services. The guest may choose to contract some or all of the services provided by the apartment hotel. The hotel signs a lease with the guest and the rent is paid either monthly or quarterly. 
<br>
<br><strong>Bed and Breakfast Hotel </strong>A European concept, bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) hotels are lodging establishments, generally operated in large family residences. These range from houses with few rooms converted into overnight facilities to small commercial buildings with twenty to thirty guest rooms. The owner usually lives on the premises and is responsible for serving breakfast to guests. Guests are accommodated in bedrooms and breakfast is served in the room or sometimes in the dining room. The bathrooms may be attached to the guest rooms or maybe on a sharing basis. As the tariff is generally lower than a full-service hotel at these properties, they are suitable for budget travelers. 
<br>
<br><strong>Casino Hotel</strong> Casino hotels provide gambling facilities, such as Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. These hotels attract clients by promoting gambling, arranging extravagant floor shows, and some may also provide charter flight services to their clients.

Nowadays, these hotels are also attracting the MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) segment. The casinos of Las Vegas, USA are among the most famous casinos in the world. 
<br>
<br><strong>Conference Centres</strong> The word conference means 'a meeting, sometimes lasting for several days, in which people with a common interest participate in discussions or listen to lectures to obtain information. Thus, a conference center is a hotel that caters to the needs of a conference delegation. These hotels provide rooms to delegates of conferences; a conference hall with the desired seating configuration for the meetings; food and beverage requirements during and after the conference; and other requirements, such as a flip chart, whiteboard with markers, overhead projector, television, VCR/VCD/DVD player, slide projector, LCD projector with screen, computer, and public address system. These are large hotels, having more than 400 guest rooms. The services provided are of the highest standard. Normally, conferences are charged as packages, which include accommodation and meeting facilities. Hotel Ashok, New Delhi is an example of a conference center. 
<br>
<br><strong>Convention Hotels</strong> Convention is defined as a formal assembly or meeting of members, representatives, or delegates of a group for general agreement on or acceptance of certain practices or attitudes. This type of meeting involves a large number of participants. The hotels catering to the needs of this segment are known as convention hotels. These hotels may have more than 2,000 rooms to accommodate a large number of delegates. They are equipped with a state-of-the-art convention center with all the required facilities, such as seating configuration (T-shaped, classroom-type, workshop-style, and theatre-style), audio-visual equipment, and a public address system to meet the demands of a convention. Hotel Taj Palace, New Delhi, and Hoteljaypee Palace, Agra are examples of convention hotels in India. A convention hotel has a greater number of rooms to host a large number of attendees as compared to conference centers. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>5. Classification on the Basis of Duration of Guest Stay
</strong><br>On the basis of the duration of the guest stay, hotels may be classified into the following categories 
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Commercial Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Transient Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Semi-residential Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Residential/ Apartment Hotel
<br><strong>‣</strong> Extended Stay Hotel
<br>
<br><strong>Commercial Hotel</strong> The duration of guest stay in these hotels is short, ranging from a few days to a week. 
<br>
<br><strong>Transient Hotel</strong> Mostly occupied by travelers as stopovers en route their journey, the duration of stay at transient hotels is very short, a day or even less. 
<br>
<br><strong>Semi-residential Hotel</strong> These hotels are generally patronized by people who are staying at a location while in transit to another place. The duration of stay may range from a few weeks to some months. They incorporate the features of both transient and residential hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Residential/Apartment Hotel</strong> As the name suggests, residential hotels provide accommodation for a long duration and are patronized by people who stay for a long time. The duration of stay may range from months to a few years. 
<br>
<br><strong>Extended Stay Hotel </strong>In today's age of downsizing, outsourcing, and mobility, business executives are often away from their hometowns for extended periods of time and require more than a hotel room. These hotels are for those guests who wish to stay for a long period (from few days to weeks) and cater to their long-term needs with special services, amenities, and facilities, such as full-fledged kitchens with dishes and kitchenware, refrigerator, separate area to wash clothes, housekeeping services, grocery shopping services, and recreational facilities. The room rates of these hotels are determined by the length of stay. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>6. Classification on the basis of Level of Services
</strong><br>On the basis of services offered by a hotel, they may be classified into the following categories
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Upmarket/Luxury/World Class Services
<br><strong>‣</strong> Mid-market/ Mid-range Services Hotels
<br><strong>‣</strong> Budget/Economy Hotels
<br>
<br><strong>Upmarket/Luxury/World Class Services Hotels</strong> Targeting the affluent segment of society, hotels in the up-market category offer world-class products with personalized services of the highest standard. The emphasis is on excellence and class. These hotels provide upscale restaurants and lounges, exquisite decor, concierge service, opulent rooms, and abundant amenities. The design and interior decoration of the hotel itself reflects the standards maintained by the hotel. The guest rooms are large with exquisite decoration and furnishings. Generally, a valet is assigned to each guest room. These hotels have many specialty restaurants with full-assisted service. Top-end recreational facilities, such as golf courses, tennis courts, designer swimming pools with trained lifeguards, and other sports facilities, shopping arcades, beauty salons, health spas with saunas and jacuzzi, are a regular feature. 
<br>These hotels also offer the facility of health clubs with trainers and dieticians. The shopping arcade may have branded retail shops of books, gifts, souvenirs, jewelry, and handicrafts. These hotels are generally patronized by affluent people who care for quality and include business executives, celebrities, and high-ranking political figures. The Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur, and ITC Hotel Grand Maratha Sheraton &amp; Towers, Mumbai are a few of the luxury hotels in India. 
<br>
<br><strong>Mid-market/ Mid-range Services Hotels</strong> These hotels offer modest services without the frills and personalized attention of luxury hotels, and appeal to the largest seg­ment&nbsp; of travelers. They may offer services such as room service, round-the-clock coffee shops, airport/railway station pick-up and drop facilities; and multi-cuisine restaurants with bars. A typical hotel offering mid-range service would be medium-sized, having roughly 150 to 300 rooms. The room rent is much lower than the upmarket hotels. These hotels are patronized by business travelers, individual travelers, and groups. Since meeting rooms are usually found in mid-market hotels, people planning small conferences, group meetings, and conventions may also find these hotels attractive. Taj Residency, Lucknow and Trident Hotel, Jaipur are examples of mid-market hotels. 
<br>
<br><strong>Budget/Economy Hotels Budget hotels</strong> focus on meeting the most basic needs of guests by providing clean, comfortable, and inexpensive rooms. Also known as economy or limited services hotels, they appeal primarily to budget-minded travelers and groups.

These hotels have clean and comfortable guest rooms, a coffee shop, a multi-cuisine restaurant, an in-room telephone, and channeled music and movies. They may also have a swimming pool, a shopping arcade, and a beauty parlor. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>7. Classification on the Basis of Ownership</strong>
<br>On the basis of ownership of a hotel, they may be classified into the following categories 
<br>
<br><strong>‣</strong> Proprietary Ownership
<br><strong>‣</strong> Management Contracts
<br><strong>‣</strong> Franchise
<br><strong>‣</strong> Time-Share Hotels
<br>
<br><strong>Proprietary Ownership</strong> Proprietary ownership is the direct ownership of one or more properties by a person or company. Small lodging properties that are owned and operated by a couple or family are common examples of proprietary ownership. The advantages of this type of hotel are that they need not maintain a particular image and they are not bound to maintain any set targets, but can independently adapt quickly to the changing trends. They are usually autonomous. 
<br>
<br><strong>Management Contracts</strong> It is a contract between the owner of the property and a hotel operator (management contractor) by which the owner employs the operator as an agent to assume the full responsibilities for operating and managing the hotel.

Some of the franchising companies are Holiday Inn, Choice international, Ramada, 
<br>
<br><strong>Time-Share Hotels </strong>A new concept of ownership also called vacation ownership or holiday ownership concepts, mushrooming up in resort areas like hills, beaches, forests. As the name suggests, it entails purchasing tourist accommodation at a popular destination for a particular time slot in a year which can be a week or weeks. Each room or suite is owned by several people who will schedule their visits well in advance with the management office to ensure that the room or suites is available or rent a unit to other vacationers if they cannot avail of the facility. It is fully furnished rooms with kitchenettes may have a dining hall with a bar. More desirable the season, the higher the timeshare fee. The price of the property will depend on the week one intends to buy. <br>The guest can choose the peak seasons, semi-peak seasons, or lean seasons. It is also required to pay an annual contribution towards the maintenance of apartments and public areas, electricity, gas, water, safety, insurance, etc. The owner can also rent out the unit through management. The most common timeshare in India is Mahindra and Mahindra, Nanda Tourist Corporation, Sterling Holiday Resorts, Avalon Resorts, Hilton Grand Vacation, Marriott Vacation Club International. 
<br><br><strong>Alternative Accommodation</strong> 
<br>Alternative accommodation can be simply defined as 'all those types of accom­modation that are available outside the formal or organized accommodation sector'. These establishments provide bed and breakfast and some basic services required by guests at a reasonable price. An alternative accommodation, thus, provides sleeping space and modest food to its users. There are certain properties that cater to the needs of a large group.
