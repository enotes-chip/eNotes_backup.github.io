                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION - ISO
</strong><br>The International Organization for Standardization is an independent, non-governmental organization, the members of which are the standards organizations of the 165 member countries. It is the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards and it facilitates world trade by providing common standards among nations. More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.
<br>
<br>Use of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.
<br>
<br><strong>Why ISO important
</strong><br>Its aim is to help organisations meet the needs of their customers and other stakeholders more effectively. This is achieved by building a framework to ensure consistent quality in the provision of goods and/or services.
The standard is based on 7 quality management principles, which include having a strong customer focus, the involvement of top management, and a drive for continual improvement.
<br>
<br>The seven quality management principles are:
<br>
<br>1 – Customer focus
<br>2 – Leadership
<br>3 – Engagement of people
<br>4 – Process approach
<br>5 – Improvement
<br>6 – Evidence-based decision making
<br>7 – Relationship management
<br>
<br><strong>Key benefits of ISO</strong>
<br>ISO is an internationally recognized certification which ensures quality of products and services of a company. Being ISO certified has lots of benefits to corporations. Some of these benefits include but not limited to;
<br>
<br><strong>Increased Credibility and Recognition: </strong>ISO certification is issued by International Organization for Standard and is accepted worldwide. Therefore, having ISO certification increases the value of your company against your competitors as well as increases your status among your clients.
<br>
<br><strong>Increased Revenues:</strong> Since your company is ISO certified, it means your quality has been testified. Therefore, you can use this as an advertising point and price your products accordingly. Having more quality products will also help you gain more customers.
<br>
<br><strong>Improved Consistency:</strong> ISO helps you increase the control of your business processes and the more you control your business, the more your consistency increases. Increased consistency means your customers are getting the same service or same products every time they are making business with you.
<br>
<br><strong>Improved decision-making:</strong> You can detect and identify problems in good time, which means that you can quickly take steps to avoid the same mistakes in the future
<br>
<br><strong>Increased Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Customers will know that your products and services will always have quality and that they will work. They will know what to expect from you. Therefore, you will get less complaints and more satisfied customers.
<br>
<br><strong>Empowered Employees:</strong> ISO certification requires the training and development of your staff being maintained. Also, it provides the necessary tools for them to do their jobs such as procedures, instructions and metrics. As a result, your employees will be more knowledgeable of what they are doing and since they will keep getting trained, their careers will improve.
<br>
<br><strong>Few Important ISO Standards
</strong><br>
<br><strong>ISO-9000 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
</strong><br>
<br>The present ISO 9001:2008 (QMS) has undergone a number of revisions from 1987 when it was first
published. The first revision was done in 1994 based on actual experiences of several thousand companies. The next revision came in 2000. This third revision of the standard was necessitated because of the publication of the revised version of ISO 9001:2008 in the year 2008. This quality
standard is easy to apply and understand. It can be adopted by any organisation who is into
manufacturing or in services. Without making any major changes within the organisation, one
can reap the benefit to improve its actual system and also the quality of the product/services with
100% guarantee for the deliverance of defect free product/services.
<br><br><em>The benefits an organisation gets by adopting ISO certification are as follows.
</em><br>1. Increased business.
<br>2. 100% utilization of time and materials.
<br>3. Improved efficiency.
<br>4. Consistent quality and timely delivery.
<br>5. 100% customer satisfaction.
<br>o. Improved control of quality, processes.
<br>7. Motivated staff with consistency output. 
<br>3. The documented system helps in Backtracking.
<br>9. Less percentage of rejection.
<br>10. Total control on quality and output.
<br>11. Validated test records of equipment.
<br>12. Valid records readily identifiable.
<br>
<br><strong>ISO 9000 and TQM
</strong><br>ISO 9000 is not TQM, but is a subcomponent of TQM and a good start on the TQM path. ISO 9000
is only the minimum required quality standard that a supplier must demonstrate to receive the ISO
9000) accreditation. TQM by contrast is much more comprehensive. TQM links quality to customer
satisfaction by requiring action on four essentials:
<br><br>(i) a strong customer orientation (internal and external in all activities in the organisation);
<br>(ii) top management's direct involvement in the delivery of quality;
<br>(iii) total company-wide participation in the delivery of quality; and
<br>(iv) the systematic analysis of quality problems focused on continuous improvement of quality performance and the prevention of quality problems.
<br>
<br><strong>ISO 14000 - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</strong><br>ISO 14000 is a series of international standards on environmental management. It provides a framework for the development of an environmental management system and the supporting audit programme.
<br>The main thrust for its development came as a result of the Rio summit on the Environment
held in 1992.
<br>As a number of national standards emerged (BS 7750 being the first ), the International
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) created a group to investigate how such standards might
<br>benefit business and industry. As a result this group recommended that an ISO committee be
created to create an International standard.
<br>
<br>ISO 14001 is the cornerstone standard of the ISO 14000 series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organisation can be certified by a third party.
Other ISO 14000 standards in the series are actually guidelines, many to help one achieve registration to ISO 14001.
<br>
<br>● ISO 14004 provides guidance on the development and implementation of environmental management systems.
<br>●ISO 14010 provides general principles of environmental auditing (now superseded by ISO 19011).
<br>●ISO 14011 provides specific guidance on audit and environmental management system
(now superseded by ISO 19011).
<br>●ISO 14012 provides guidance on qualification criteria for environmental auditors and lead auditors (now superseded by ISO 19011).
<br>●ISO 14013/5 provides audit program review and assessment material.
<br>●ISO 14020 + labelling issues.
<br>●ISO 14030 + provides guidance on performance targets and monitoring within an Environmental Management System.
<br>●ISO 14040 + covers life cycle issues.
<br>
<br>Of all these, ISO 14001 is not only the most well known, but is the only ISO 14000 standard against
which it is currently possible to be certified by an external certification authority.
<br>
<br><strong>ISO 22000 FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</strong><br>ISO 22000 is an international standard that defines the requirements of a food safety management
system covering all organisations in the food chain from farm to fork.
<br>It is suitable for any business in the entire food chain, including inter-related organisations such as producers of equipment, packaging material, cleaning agents, additives and ingredients. ISO 22000:2005 is also for companies seeking to integrate their quality management system, e.g. ISO 9001:2000 and their food safety management system.
<br>
<br><strong><em>ISO 22000:2005 Provides
</em></strong><br>1. Interactive communication, internationally and across the supply chain.
<br>2. Compliance with HACCP principles such as hazard analysis, identify critical control points (CCPs) , establish critical links, monitor CCPs, establish corrective action, record keeping and verification.
<br>3. Harmony with voluntary and pre-requisite standards.
<br>4. A Structure that is aligned with ISO 9001:2000.
<br>5. Process control.
<br>
<br><strong>ISO 22000:2005 Certification Has the Following Advantages
</strong><br>●Improves the organisations profile and credibility.
<br>●Provides a harmonised standard accepted all over the world.
<br>●Simple to understand, apply and recognise because management system principles have been integrated with HACCP.
<br>●Helps in ensuring compliance with all food safety legislations.
<br>●Reduces possible risks of penalties and litigation.
<br>●Transforms the organisations corporate image.
<br>●Enhances the products quality and safety.
<br>●Allows Continuous improvement of the food system.
<br>●Enhances overall performance of organisation.
<br>●Ensures to compete effectively in national and international markets.
<br>
<br>ISO 22000:2005 specifies requirements for a food safety management system where an organisation
in the food chain needs to demonstrate its ability to control food safety hazards in order to ensure
that food is safe at the time of human consumption.
<br>It is applicable to all organisations, regardless of size, which are involved in any aspect of food
chain and want to implement systems that consistently provide safe products. The means of
meeting any requirements of ISO 22000:2005 can be accomplished through the use of internal and/
or external resources.
<br>
<br><strong><em>ISO 22000:2005 specifies requirements to enable an organisation.
</em></strong><br>
<br>●to plan, implement, operate, maintain and update a food safety management system aimed at providing products that, according to their intended use, are safe for the consumer,
<br>●to demonstrate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory food safety
requirements,
<br>●to evaluate and assess customer requirements and demonstrate conformity with those mutually agreed customer requirements that relate to food safety, in order to enhance customer
<br>satisfaction,
<br>●to effectively communicate food safety issues to their suppliers, customers and relevant interested parties in the food chain,
<br>●to ensure that the organisation conforms to its stated food safety policy,
<br>●to demonstrate such conformity to relevant interested parties, and
<br>●to seek certification or registration of its food safety management system by an external organisation, or make a self-assessment or self-declaration of conformity to ISO 22000:2005.
<br>
<br>The ISO 22000, is the one universal food safety management standard that works across all other
standards. This standard uses a common vocabulary and improves communications between
everyone involved in the food industry.
<br>
<br><strong>Few other Standards
</strong><br>
<br><strong>ISO 50001: 2018 - Energy Management
</strong><br>ISO 50001: 2018 provides guidance for companies in implementing an Energy Management System (EnMS) that aims at improving efficiency in the use of energy.&nbsp;This aims to reduce an organisation’s energy footprint by minimising greenhouse gas emissions. ISO 50001 is not obligatory, and many organisations implement it solely to comply with stakeholder expectations. Over 20,000 certifications have been issued for this standard with a 69% increase from 2015.
<br>
<br><strong><em>OBJECTIVE OF ISO 50001:2018
</em></strong><br>It’s designed to be S.M.A.R.T (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-based): 
<br>• Identify and monitor the costs of energy consumption. 
<br>• Involve collating and analysing the utility bills (electricity, gas, water) and any other bills relating to energy consumption. 
<br>• The charging system and tariffs should be checked to determine if an improved rate 
<br>• Reduction of wastes and improvement of recycling rate 
<br>• Promotion of energy and resource conservation 
<br>• Proper control of chemical substances 
<br>• Development of environmentally benign products 
<br>
<br><br><strong>ISO 31000: 2018 - Risk Management
</strong><br>Today’s business world is riddled with uncertainty. Risks facing companies have a direct impact on the economic performance, reputation, as well as safety and environmental outcomes.
<br>
<br>ISO 31000 cannot be used for certification purposes, but it provides a framework for managing risks. It offers guidance to organisations for internal and external audit programs, and enables organisations to achieve objectives in an uncertain environment by facilitating the identification of opportunities and threats.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Principles of ISO 31000
</em></strong><br>● Risk management must be integrated into all business operations and activities
<br>● The approach must be structured and comprehensive.
<br>● Processes and the risk management framework should be customized to suit the organization’s goals and context.
<br>● Stakeholders must be involved with the management framework; it must be inclusive.
<br>● Risk management must be dynamic and robust; preemptive thinking, anticipating, detecting, acknowledging and responding to changes.
<br>● Risk management takes into account any limitations of available information.
<br>● Human and cultural factors are paramount, and should be considered at all stages and aspects of risk management.
<br>● The risk management framework is continuously improved through learning and experience.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits of ISO 31000
</strong><br>
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Giving you a competitive advantage</em></strong> because ISO is an internationally recognized symbol for quality standards
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Increasing employee awareness of organizational risks</em></strong> by including them in the management framework and giving them responsibility for the processes they commonly use
<br>● <strong><em>Reduce the frequency of, and ultimately eliminate risks</em></strong> by educating employees and stakeholders on identified risks
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Improve trust of stakeholders</em></strong> by maintaining transparency and communicating risks (and demonstrating risk responsibility and mitigation)
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Foster forward-thinking mentalities </em></strong>by encouraging employees to envision all potential outcomes of a given situation
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Improve company culture </em></strong>by bringing disparate departments together to exchange fresh perspectives, and consider how they might work together more effectively
<br>●<strong><em> Improve success rate</em></strong> in all business operations by focusing on the process, thinking preemptively instead of reactively, and giving employees ownership of their work responsibilities
<br><br>ISO 31000 can be invaluable for preparing a business for all eventualities; by understanding the worst-case scenario, a business is better equipped to make the most of the resources and opportunities currently available to them.&nbsp;<br></p>
