</strong><br>Protective clothing is used in almost every workplace, from commercial kitchens to building sites. It protects the wearer from injury due to blunt impacts, electrical hazards, heat, chemicals and more. Each workplace uses different types of protective clothing, from goggles and lab coats to safety boots and hard hats, and employers have basic duties concerning the provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at work to protect their staff.
<br>
<br><strong>PPE FOR THE FOOD AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY
</strong><br>Much like construction workers, kitchen and hospitality staff need to be protected from their working environment. From chefs to cleaners, there are many tasks that can cause injury at work.
<br>
<br><strong>Why Wear Protective Clothing In The Kitchen?
</strong><br>Kitchens are hot, busy and dangerous places to work. Hot ovens, open fires, and sharp knives all add to the risk of injury. Even to the most experienced chefs. Wearing PPE when working in a kitchen helps you to prevent injury by protecting you from burns, cuts and more.
<br>
<br><strong>Why Wear Protective Clothing When Working With Food?
</strong><br>Wearing protective clothing when preparing and cooking food helps to protect both your customers and yourself. Food-safe gloves and hairnets help you to hygienically prepare food and prevent foreign objects from falling into food. Clean aprons, gloves, towels and more will help you to hygienically prepare food, protecting your customers from food poisoning or injury. Clothing can also help to protect you from injury when working with food too. But what clothing do you need?
<br>
<br>“More of protective clothing than uniform.” The Kitchen uniform consists of the following:
<br>
<br><strong><em>Toque/Headwear
</em></strong><br>• Keeps the head cool and prevents the hair from falling into the food.
<br>• Cotton/cloth caps are difficult to maintain whereas, paper caps are disposable hence they are neat.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Scarf/Neckerchief
</em></strong><br>• Absorbs sweat.
<br>• Identification/designation.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Double-breasted jacket
</em></strong><br>• Protects the chest and front.
<br>• Easy to remove overhead or sideways.
<br>• Cotton cloth buttons – heat resistant.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Apron
</em></strong><br>• Below-knee level.
<br>• Double protection prevents the jacket &amp; trousers from becoming dirty.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cotton checked trousers
</em></strong><br>• Double shade hides the dirt.
<br>• Identifies designation.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Shoes and Socks
</em></strong><br>• Clogs can be used but it is expensive
<br>• Metal frame in front protects the toes.
<br>• Easy to remove legs.
<br>• Socks
<br>• Absorbs sweat.
<br>• Provides good grip.
<br>• Steady steps while walking
<br>
<br><strong><em>Slipbuster Safety Boots
</em></strong><br>Kitchen footwear is also designed to keep you safe. Many have a non-slip construction to ensure you can stay on your feet, even when the floors are slippery. There are three different types of certification for non-slip footwear;
<br>
<br>SRA - tested on ceramic tile, wetted with a dilute soap solution
<br>SRB - tested on smooth steel with glycerol
<br>SRC - tested under both the above conditions
<br>
<br>Slipbuster footwear has SRC non-slip soles that make them perfect for use in commercial kitchens. Some slipbuster shoes are called ‘safety boots’ or ‘safety shoes’. They are made from strong materials, such as leather, to offer extra ankle support and protection against falling equipment and utensils.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cut-resistant gloves</em></strong> offer protection for your hands whilst you prepare foods. Great for training or for cutting unusually tough produce with razor-sharp knives; cut-resistant gloves are essential in every kitchen.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Oven gloves</em></strong> will protect your hands from hot cookware when using ovens and other cooking equipment. Their heat-resistant construction makes it safe for you to remove baking trays, dishes, and other cookware from ovens without burning your hands. Blue vinyl gloves offer protection from certain foods too. Some foods, such as hot chilies, can cause irritation if handled without gloves.
<br>
<br><strong>WHAT PROTECTIVE CLOTHING SHOULD BE WORN WHEN CLEANING?
</strong><br>Commercial cleaning chemicals can be dangerous if not used correctly or if you’re not wearing the right protective equipment. Strong acids can damage skin and eyes, so wearing the right protective clothing and equipment is crucial to maintaining safety.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Safety goggles </em></strong>are the best way to protect your eyes from accidental splashes of cleaning fluids. They are made from strong plastics and rubbers that make them comfortable to wear whilst giving you reliable protection. Goggles offer more protection when using chemicals as they have a surround that hugs your face, leaving no gaps for liquids to get in. Our safety goggles conform to the European standards for eye protection (EN166).
<br>
<br>Cleaning staff should also use rubber gloves to protect their skin from burns and irritation. These are available in a range of lengths and thicknesses to offer different levels of protection. Color-coded gloves are perfect for washing up and light-duty cleaning, whilst long length, heavy duty gloves are great for use with strong chemicals or tricky cleaning tasks such as cleaning ovens.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Waterproof aprons</em></strong> prevent damage to your clothing and add a layer of protection on top of your lab coat or overalls. They are available in both heavy and light duty variations for different tasks and environments; from washing dishes to bleaching floors. You can also use tabards rather than waterproof aprons. These often come with pockets for storing cleaning equipment, such as cloths and sprays. These aren’t waterproof, however, so are best suited to general cleaning duties such as dusting, polishing and vacuuming.
<br>
<br><strong>WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING PROTECTIVE CLOTHING
</strong><br>When deciding what protective clothing you and your staff will need to use for each task, you should consider;
<br>
<br>* What hazards do the tasks present? Knowing the hazards that come with each task will help you to plan which clothing and/or equipment you should use. For example, if you know there will be harmful chemicals, consider splashing and skin contact.
<br>* Is it suitable for the conditions? Make sure the clothing you choose is suitable for the working conditions and environment.
<br>* Does it offer the right level of protection? Choose the clothing and equipment that adequately protects the wearer.
<br>* Do you and your staff need training on the items or do the items require maintenance? Ensure your staff knows how to fit and wear the items properly to ensure maximum safety.
<br>* Do you know when/if/how the items need replacing? Knowing how to clean, repair, or replace worn-out safety clothing is crucial to keeping your staff protected.
<br>* Before you and your staff get started using your new protective clothing, you should consider the following questions;
<br>* Do the items fit properly? Wearing protective clothing that is too big can make tasks more difficult, so make sure each item fits correctly before use.
<br>* How do they feel? Is the wear suitably comfortable? The wearer can become distracted if the clothing is not comfortable, which increases the risk of accidents.
<br>* Does the protective clothing interfere with the task at hand? Thick gloves can make more intricate cleaning tasks more difficult; ensure all clothing is suitable for the task at hand.
<br>* Does the protective clothing create extra hazards, such as overheating or entanglement? Long aprons can get on equipment and machinery. Ensure the protective clothing and equipment don’t create any further hazards for you and your staff.&nbsp;<br></p>
