<br>
<br>Equipment, utensils and all food contact surfaces should be smooth, easy to clean, durable, non-toxic, non-absorbent, corrosion resistant and well maintained. They should be able to
<br>Withstand continuous contact with food, water, cleaning agents, sanitisers and heat. Meat blocks, chopping boards and tandoors are an exception and will be dealt with separately.
<br>While selecting equipment, certain standards need to be kept in mind.
<br>
<br><strong>1. Functional:</strong> It should do the job for which it is intended with maximum efficiency. It is desirable if there are less number of parts required for efficient functioning of the equipment.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Easy to clean:</strong> It should be easy to disassemble and reassemble. All parts should be accessible for cleaning. The parts should be easily reached and so constructed that dirt, food residue and cleaning material does not get logged in them.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Durable:</strong> The material used should not dent, buckle, pit or chip and should be able to Withstand heavy wear and tear. Stainless steel and kadappa are most durable and ideally suited for work surfaces in catering establishments.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Sooth and sealed surfaces:</strong> Cracks, crevices, open spaces and holes are likely to hide microorganisms, pests, dirt, and food particles,. and allow liquids to accumulate. Such surfaces are practically impossible to clean. All joints and seams in utensils, equipment, food areas and wash up areas should be sealed, for example, hollow handles on pots and Pans and faulty insulation in urness is undesirable.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Closed:</strong> In non-food areas, all openings should be closed, i.e. an opening of 0.8 mm or less is considered closed. This opening is not large enough to harbour pests or collect dirt.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Rounded corners and edges:</strong> Internal corners or edges should be covered or rounded off and external surfaces should have dosed, soldered corners or edges.
<br>
<br><strong>7. Non-toxic: </strong>Coating material used on a food contact surface should be nontoxic. Lead-based paints and some sealers are not permitted in the food area. Coating material should be hardy. It should not chip or crack by normal handling. Single service articles, plastics or disposables should be made from non-toxic, food grade material.
<br>
<br><strong>8. Non-absorbent: </strong>Material used should not impart taste, colour or flavour to food and should not react with any food ingredient or cleaning agent. Old equipment may become absorbent, and may retain food odours.
<br>
<br><strong>9. Safe:</strong> Electrical fittings should be well protected, sealed, water and shockproof and should not trail across floors or gangways.
<br>
<br><strong>10. Corrosion resistant: </strong>Material used should maintain its original quality and appearance in-spite of repeated exposure to food, liquid, cleaning material, sanitisers, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>11. Conformity: </strong>It should always meet the standards set by the regulatory agencies.
<br>
<br><strong>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR CLEANING EQUIPMENT
</strong><br>
<br>For all stationary equipment, follow the manufacturer's instructions for disassembling and cleaning the machine. Some stationary equipment is designed for cleaning-in-place by pumping a detergent and sanitising solutions through them.
<br>Although each piece of equipment in the catering establishment will need specific instructions for operating and cleaning, a list of general instructions is given below. From the safety and sanitation aspect it is essential that all employees using the equipment should be familiar with these procedures before cleaning or handling the machine.
<br>
<br>1. Read the instructions for operating the equipment as well as the cleaning procedures displayed on the plaque fitted near the machine. It is the responsibility of the management to display all instructions in a prominent place.
<br>2. Turn the switch to off position and let the unit cool after shutting off gas or electricity.
<br>3. Drain off or remove all leftover food.
<br>4. Remove plug from socket.
<br>5. Disassemble parts for cleaning. Immerse small parts in hot detergent solution and wash in the dishwashing machine if practicable or use suitable cleaning agents and tools. Remove adjustable shelves. Wash, rinse and sanitise all parts to remove all traces of soil by three bucket method. The three bucket method is explained in previous units under the three methods to wash, rinse and sanitise food contact surfaces.
<br>6. Start cleaning from the top. Use a dry cloth and polish metal surfaces. Clean legs and casters of movable equipment.
<br>7. Dry all parts thoroughly to prevent rusting, shock or microbial growth.
<br>8. Reassemble all cleaned and dried parts.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>INSTALLATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF EQUIPMENT
</strong><br>Equipment should be arranged in such a way that it is easy to operate, does not hamper the flow&nbsp; of work, facilitates easy cleaning as well as protects food from any nearby source of contamination
like soiled dishes, garbage bins, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Large Equipment
</strong><br>Large or heavy duty equipment is either permanently mounted on the floor or is mobile with casters fitted underneath. Mobile equipment is gaining popularity because it can be moved by one person and simplifies the cleaning of walls and floors near the equipment. It also permits a change in the overall arrangement.
<br>It should be easy to disconnect. Utility connections should be flexible and long enough to permit movement while cleaning. Free standing equipment or equipment that is immobile, requiring a number of people to lift it, should be mounted at least 15 cm (six inches) off the floor or permanent, fixed on a well constructed cemented platform, leaving no gaps for pests and dirt. It may also be sealed to the wall or to other equipment. Sufficient pace should be left between the equipment and the wall to permit easy cleaning and create no obstruction in work. If equipment is sealed to the floor, a 2.5 cm (one inch) to 10 cm (four inch) toe space should be left to prevent stubbing toes.
<br>
<br><strong>Wall Mounted Equipment
</strong><br>Alternatively, equipment may also be mounted on the wall, supported by a sturdy bracket, leaving the floor space clear. A suitable gap should be left between the wall and equipment to allow easy cleaning. The size of the gap will vary with the size of the equipment, and ranges from 15 cms to 45 cms (six to eighteen inches) for floor mounted equipment.
<br>
<br><strong>Small or Portable Equipment
</strong><br>It is placed on table tops or counter tops. Equipment which is occasionally used, can be stored on racks when not in use. Such equipment is generally light in weight and should be shifted often to keep the gap between rack and equipment clean.
<br>Heavy counter top equipment should be mounted on legs leaving a 10 cm (four inch) clearance
<br>between the base of the equipment and top of the counter for ease in cleaning.
<br>
<br><strong>FOOD PREPARATION SURFACES
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Work Tables and Platforms
</strong><br>Food preparation surfaces should be impervious and smooth and so designed that thorough cleaning is possible. Wooden surfaces are not recommended for preparation of food because it is difficult to maintain. Wood absorbs stains and Odors and holds moisture and swells. It encourages the growth of microorganisms and pests, and the surface gets cracked and chipped easily. Wooden surfaces should be Covered with Formica.
<br>
<br>Aluminium top tables get dented and pitted and are not as durable as steel. Stainless steel top tables on mild steel stands are recommended. Tables should not be placed against a wall. They should preferably be free standing. Naturally occurring stone, such as kadappa, granite OF marble platforms and work table tops are ideal. T hey are durable and easy to clean. Platforms built into the wall should have edges covered and sealed. The supporting structure of all tables should be easy to clean.
<br>
<br><strong>MATERIALS USED FOR MAKING LARGE AND SMALL EQUIPMENT'S
</strong><br><em><strong>Stainless steel:</strong> </em>This is an alloy of iron, chromium and nickel. It is relatively non-corrosive and is recommended for use in the kitchen. The thickness or gauge of the stainless steel sheet used will depend on the wear and tear that the equipment or the surface will be subjected to. It is used for tabletops, cooking ranges, sinks, urns, etc. and a wide variety of small equipment.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Galvanised steel and iron:</em></strong> This is steel treated with zinc. It has poor wear-ability and sanitary quality as it rusts easily and gathers soil.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Mild steel: </em></strong>This is an alloy of iron and carbon. It is used in supporting stands for equipment. Galvanised iron is used as a substitute for mild steel.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cold rolled steel: </em></strong>This is non-corrosive because it has a porcelain fused steel coat.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cast iron: </em></strong>It is ideal for equipment that is to be heated like grills, skillets, griddles, chapati puffer, and woks.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Aluminium: </em></strong>It is relatively non-corrosive, non-porous, smooth, lightweight and strong. As it is light it is suitable for mobile equipment. It is a good conductor of heat and is used for cooking utensils like pots, pans and griddles. ISI grade aluminium is permitted for food containers.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Hindalium</em></strong>: It is an aluminium alloy with chromium or nickel and is used for making utensils. Aluminium alloys are used for making legs, racks and hoods on equipment. It is not recommended for ovens and cooking ranges as it is not very durable.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Copper:</em></strong> It is an excellent conductor of heat, hence, it is used on the outer surface of utensils in contact with the flame or source of heat. Because of its attractive appearance it is used for food Service. In such cases, it should be tin-plated on the inner surface. Acidic foods in contact with Copper can poison food.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Brass: </em></strong>It is a good conductor of heat. It is an alloy of copper and zinc. All food contact surfaces should be tin-plated. It is used for making large pots and pans. Maintenance is costly,
<br>
<br><strong><em>Wood: </em></strong>It is popular as a chopping surface as it does not harm the knife blade. It is also used for making pushers for grinding machines. It is light in weight. It has poor wearability and sanitary quality because it absorbs stains, odours and holds moisture.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Polypropylene:</em></strong> It is gradually replacing wood and is used in making meat blocks, chopping boards&nbsp; and as pushers in wet grinders. It does not absorb moisture Or retain stains and odours.&nbsp; Polypropylene boards are available in different colors. To prevent cross contamination, select a specific colour for a particular section. The knives used should also have a colour tag. It should be sanitized in 200ppm chlorine solution for 15 minutes.
<br>
<br><strong>EQUIPMENT REQUIRING SPECIAL ATTENTION 
</strong><br>
<br><strong><em>1. Cleaning-in-place equipment:</em></strong> Some equipment is SO designed that it can be cleaned by circulating a cleaning and sanitising solution through the entire system. The solution cleans all food contact surfaces. This equipment should be self-draining and should leave no residue of cleaning liquid inside the machine. Some hand-operated beverage dispensers and automatic ice-making machines are cleaned in this way. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>2. Microwave ovens:</em></strong> They should be checked to ensure that no excessive high frequency emission is occurring, as this could be an invisible health hazard. Food to be heated should not be placed in metal containers or left indefinitely in the oven.
<br>Microwave ovens are also used to thaw frozen foods. Once thawed, such foods should be cooked immediately. Cleaning procedure should be strictly as per manufacturer's instructions.
<br>
<br><strong><em>3. Refrigerators and freezers:</em></strong> They should be so constructed that they are easy to clean. Cleaning&nbsp;procedures are explained in the previous unit under ‘Refrigerated Store’.
<br>
<br><strong><em>4. Dishwashers, sinks, ware tables and drain boards:</em></strong> Dishwashing machines should work efficiently and should also be easy to clean and maintain. Piping to and from machines should be short in order to prevent loss of heat. The machine should be installed at least 15 cm (Six inches) above the ground to facilitate easy cleaning beneath the machine.
<br>sinks, ware tables and drain boards should have a slope of 1 cm (1/8th inch) per metre to prevent collection of water and hasten drying. Other details have been discussed in previous units under Manual and Machine dishwashing.
<br>
<br><strong><em>5. Vending machines: </em></strong>These machines should be cleaned daily as per manufacturers’ instructions.
<br>
<br><strong><em>6. Chopping boards and meat blocks: </em></strong>They are traditionally made of absorbent materials like wood. Wooden boards and blocks develop cracks, criss-crosses on the surface and rough edges and they may chip. All such surfaces can harbour microorganisms and contaminate the food being chopped. Particles of wood may also get into food. To prevent this from occurring, the surface should be evened regularly and the wood used must be of a hard non-absorbent Variety. It should not contain toxic substances or impact any odor or taste to food. It should also be seamless. Wooden block and boards are being replaced by hard rubber and polypropylene. Wooden boards and blocks should be cleaned immediately after use. The surface should be wiped clean, brushed with a wire brush and Scrubbed clean with a cleaning solution. <br>
<br><strong><em>7. Tandoor:</em></strong> Also called the clay oven, it should be fitted with a hood and exhaust fan to remove smoke and prevent soot from collecting. It can be tiled with ceramic tiles on the outside for easy maintenance. As it is traditionally operated on coal, all accumulated ash should be removed daily. It needs to be replaced every three to four month as cracks develop inside the tandoor and it may break.&nbsp;<br></p>
