</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong>INTRODUCTION
</strong><br>Stocks are the favourable liquids that form the backbone of Western cookery. That is the reason they are termed as fond in French, which translates to ‘foundation’ or ‘base’. Stocks are used in almost all the cuisines around the world including South-East Asia. Over the years, cooks realized that during cooking, the nutrients leach into the water, causing the loss of flavours as well as essential minerals and vitamins. Thus, the need to use that liquid in one way or the other to retain the nutritional aspects of food arose. 
<br>
<br>Stocks give the entire body to a dish and stocks around the world have their own distinctive tastes and flavours. For example, Indian cooking uses a stock called yakhni for its biryanis and other dishes. whereas stock flavoured with seaweed is used in Japanese cooking. In this chapter, we will discuss various types of stocks and their usage in the gastronomic world.
<br>
<br><strong>STOCKS
</strong><br>Stock can be simply defined as a liquid chat has been simmered for a long time in order to extract
flavours from the ingredients used.
Any type of liquid can be used to start a stock. In almost all the cases, water is the liquid medium used, but then certain stocks can be made using a combination of milk and water as well.
<br>
<br>Stock is usually made from bones and vegetables. The types of bones used for a stock would depend
upon the final usage of the stock. To prepare chicken stock, one would use chicken bones only and
similarly, to get lamb stock, one has to use lamb bones and so on.
Bones are porous in nature and hence, prolonged amount of cooking at lower temperatures is the best method of cooking stocks.
<br>Stocks are simmered for a long time in order to extract the flavour from the bones and vegetables used. Boiling would not let the flavours leach into the liquid as the pores of the bones would seal in high temperatures and hence, it will hamper the secretion of juices into the liquid. Boiling would also make the stock ‘cloudy’. The bones and vegetables contain impurities, which when simmered rise up to the surface and it can be skimmed off. This results in a clear stock, which would give a nice visual appeal to the dish.
<br><br>Simmering of the stock is the most important part, which gives a definite characteristic to the stock.
A chicken stock simmered with Indian spices would be used only in Indian cooking, chicken stock with Thai flavourings would be used only for Thai dishes. Similarly, Western stocks would use herbs and other vegetables depending upon the type of stock. The bunch of herbs used to flavour Western stocks is termed as ‘bouquet garni’. Certain spices such as peppercorns, bay leaf, and dried thyme are used to spice up the stocks and are known as sachet d'epices, literally meaning ‘bag of spices’. A stock should be flavoured enough to allow it for easy identification but the flavours should not be overpowering to mask the real flavour of the stock.
<br>
<br><strong>Stocks form the foundation for
</strong><br><strong>1. </strong>Soups                                       
<br><strong>2. </strong>Stews                                          
<br><strong>3. </strong>Braised dishes
<br><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>Sauces
<br><strong>5. </strong>Gravies
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF STOCKS
</strong><br>The bones and vegetables are simmered to extract colour, flavour, aroma, and body of the resulting
stock. The stocks are basically classified according to their colours. Both white and brown stocks are made from bones and vegetables; however, the process followed for each one is slightly different. 
<br>
<br><strong>White Stock
</strong><br>Both white and brown stocks are made from bones and vegetables, however, the process followed for each one is slightly different. Many people think that white stocks are made from white meat and brown stocks from red; but this is not true. In case of white stock, the bones are blanched 'to get rid
of the impurities. Vegetables such as leeks. onions, celery, and turnips are used to flavour the stock as red-coloured vegetables like carrots will change the colour of the stock. No tomato product is used for white stocks.
<br>
<br><strong>Different kind of White Stocks
</strong><br>● White beef stock
<br>● White Mutton stock
<br>● White Veal Stock
<br>● White Chicken Stock
<br>● Fish Stock
<br>● Vegetable stock
<br>
<br><strong>Brown Stock
</strong><br>In case of brown stocks, the bones and vegetables are roasted or caramelized. Tomato paste is used and it is also sauteed to get a deep brown colour. The colour of the brown stock should be amber colour. The shin bones of beef have the best favours and hence, the most preferred for brown beef stocks.
<br>
<br><strong>Different kind of White Stocks
</strong><br>● Brown Beef stock (Estouffade)
<br>● Brown mutton Stock
<br>● Brown veal stock
<br>● Brown game stock
<br>● Vegetable stock
<br>
<br><strong>Points to be consider while Preparation of Stock
</strong><br>As the stock is an important ingredient in various dishes, care should be taken in the preparation as follows:
<br><br>• All fat should be removed from bones at the outset, as the stock becomes very greasy and becomes rancid soon.
<br>• Marrow must be removed and put aside for use as a separate dish (marrow toast) or as garnish (petite marmite-Soup)
<br>• The stock should only simmer. If allowed to boil, the agitation and particles of fat cause emulsification to become milky or cloudy.
<br>• Bouquet garni should be tied to a handle of the stockpot. Cut large pieces of vegetables and add later on, as it flavors the stock. If allowed to remain in the pot too long, the vegetables will begin to disintegrate, discoloring the stock.
<br>• The scum should be discarded.
<br>• For storing, the stock should be strained and liquid should be cooled. No fat should be allowed to remain on the surface, as heat is prevented from escaping and may cause the stock to turn or become sour.
<br>• Stock could be stored in a refrigerator or cold room.
<br>• Stocks turn cloudy, if boiled too rapidly and if a lid is used and not carefully strained and not skimmed properly.
<br>
<br><strong>Ratio of Flavouring and spices used in stock
</strong><br>●&nbsp;<strong>Standard Mirepoix:</strong> 50% onion/leek*+25% carrot/turnip*+25% celery/celery root* (starred for white stock)
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Sachet d'epices: </strong>1 sprig thyme+1 bay leaf + 3-4 parsley stems+5 gm pepper corns/optional+1 garlic clove (for 4 liters of water)
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Bouquet Garni:</strong> 1 sprig thyme + 1 bayleaf+1/6 “ of celery stick+1/6 “ of leeks (for 4 liters of water)
<br>
<br><strong>PREPARATION OF STOCKS
</strong><br>
<br><strong>1. FISH STOCK
</strong><br>French: Fumet 
<br>Yields 4 litres
<br>
<br><strong><em>Ingredients
</em></strong><br>• 5 kg Fish bones
<br>• 100 g Butter
<br>• 500 g White mirepoix
<br>• 1 litre White wine 
<br>• 4 litres Water
<br>• 1 Sachet d'epices
<br>
<br><strong><em>Method
</em></strong><br><strong>1. </strong>Clean and wash the fish bones to remove any dirt.
<br><strong>2. </strong>Cut the bones into smaller pieces and sauté with mirepoix.
<br><strong>3.</strong> Add wine and cook for two minutes.
<br><strong>4.</strong> Add cold water and sachet of spices and let the stock simmer for 20 minutes.
<br><strong>5.</strong> Remove from the fire and strain. Discard the mirepoix and bones and cool immediately for further.
<br><br><strong><em>Usage
</em></strong><br><strong>1.</strong> It is used for making various types of fish soups.
<br><strong>2. </strong>It is used for making fish stews such as bouillabaisse
<br><strong>3.</strong> It is used for making sauces, such as fish vefouté and lemon butter sauce, to accompany fish dishes.
<br><strong>4</strong>. It is reduced to a glaze and used as an aspic on cold poached fish.
<br>
<strong><em><br>Tips For Good Fish Stock :
</em></strong><br>1. Use good quality bones that are free from any foul smell. Heads of fish result in good-flavoured stock.
<br>2. Use bones that are free from any meat, as the bones with meat will make the stock cloudy.
<br>3. Sauté the fish bones with mirepoix in very little amount of butter as this will bring out the flavour. Excess butter will result in an oily stock.
<br>4. Do not use oily fish to make fish stock, as the oily fish are too strong in flavour and also it will result in an oily stock.
<br>5. Use cold water for making soup and do not boil the stock. Always simmer the stocks for maximum flavour.
<br>6. Do not cook the fish stock for more than 20 minutes, as it will make the stock bitter and too fishy in flavour.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Storage
</em></strong><br><strong>1.</strong> Strain the stock and cool it immediately on an ice bath. If kept at room temperature, it will give rise to microorganisms to breed as the temperature would be in the danger zone.
<br><strong>2.</strong> Store in a clean container preferably steel, as the other metals would react to cause food poisoning.
<br><strong>3</strong>. Label and mark with the date of production for the FIFO concept.
<br><strong>4.</strong> Store at 4 to 5°C for not more than two days. However, for longer storage, set the stock in ice cubes trays and once frozen, can be vacuum packed and stored in the freezer at -18°C one month.

<br>
<br><strong><em>Tips For Good Vegetable Stock :
</em></strong><br>1. Vegetables stocks are simple to make and do not require too much preparation time. It is suggested to make the vegetable stock for its intended use. For example, to make minestrone, one would use certain vegetables. After processing the vegetables, the leftover trimmings can be utilized to make a stock for minestrone as it would impart the body and real flavour to the soup. Similarly, for a mushroom soup, utilize the trimmings of mushrooms to prepare the vegetable stock.
<br>2. Skim the scum that keeps rising to the top, as these are impurities and if mixed with the stock will
result in a cloudy stock. .
<br>
<br><strong><em>Storage
</em></strong><br>1. Same as above stocks.

<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Few Basic Rules Commonly Prescribed for Preparing Stock
</strong><br>• The stock ingredients are simmered starting with cold water. This promotes the extraction of collagen, which may be sealed in by hot water.
<br>• Stocks are simmered gently, with bubbles just breaking the surface, and not boiled. If a stock is boiled, it will be cloudy.
<br>• Salt is usually not added to a stock, as this causes it to become too salty, since most stocks are reduced to make soups and sauces.
<br>• Meat is added to stock before vegetables, and the “scum” that rises to the surface is skimmed off before further ingredients are added.
<br>• The fat can be removed after the stock is finished and cooled, as it floats, separates, and solidifies into globs within the stock, and can be removed with ease.
<br>• Stocks can be frozen and kept indefinitely but are better fresh.
<br>
<br><strong>Care and precautions:
</strong><br>• Golden rule is to simmer not to boil. Always simmer the stock for extraction of better flavour. No green leaf (leaf from celery stick) should be added to avoid discolouration of stock. 
<br>• Use of proper timings is always important. Blanching of bones in hot water is very important, before you make white stock of bones. 
<br>• Always roast the bones to an even brown colour and not to burn them. 
<br>• Do not stir while simmering, as few vegetables get mushy and while stirring they get mushy and make the stock cloudy. 
<br>• Add sachet d’ epice at later stages so that spices don’t over power the flavour and aroma of the main ingredient used.
<br>
<br><strong>Important terms:
</strong><br>
<br>● <strong>Broth:</strong> It's known as bouillon in French, it is a result of poaching meat or vegetables in a liquid medium.
<br>●<strong> Court bouillon:</strong> water boiled with seasoning and flavourings with an acidic medium, such as wine or lemon juice, is called court bouillon.
<br>● <strong>Neutral stock</strong>: It is usually referred to a veal stock which is white in colour and has a neutral flavour.
<br>●<strong> Fumet:</strong> Fish stock is called fumet in French. A strong-flavoured cooking liquid used for flavouring sauces, fumet usually refers to concentrated mushroom and fish stocks
<br>● <strong>Remouillage:</strong> It is a stock that is made from bones that have already been used once to make a stock. The stock is weaker than the first stock and is sometimes called "second stock". It is sometimes used for water in making another stock or is reduced to make a glace.<br></p>
