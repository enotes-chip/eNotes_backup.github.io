</strong><br>Nature has given us many kinds of food in various forms. A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.
<br>
<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was
cooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.
<br>
<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur
in food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.
<br>
<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to
create an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.
<br>
<br><strong>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?
</strong><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.
<br>
<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.
<br>
<br><strong>CARBOHYDRATES</strong> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.
Heat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and
gelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the
Sugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a
caramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.
<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,
The thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.
<br>
<br><strong>VEGETABLE FIBRE</strong> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.
<br>
<br><strong>PROTEINS</strong> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.
<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in
dissolving few connective tissues.
<br>
<br><strong>FATS</strong> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.
<br>
<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond
a certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>CONCLUSION
</strong><br>
<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.
<br>
<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:
<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.
<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.
<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.
<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.
<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.
<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.
<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.
<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.
<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.
<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.
<br>
<br>
Now, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES
</strong><br>
<br><strong>VARIOUS TEXTURES
</strong><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:
<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel
<br>
<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.
<br>
<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.
<br>
<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.
This satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.
<br>
<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.
<br><br>● Airy
<br>● Spongy
<br>● Jelly
<br>● Soft
<br>● Hard / Firm
<br>● Short
<br>● Flaky
<br>● Coarse
<br>● Heavy
<br>● Light
<br>● Grainy
<br>● Smooth
<br>● Crispy
<br>● Crunchy
<br>● Creamy
<br>● Chewy
<br>● Crusty
<br>● Chunky
<br>
<br><strong>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES
</strong><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:
<br><br><strong>1) Thick consistency:</strong> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.
<br><strong>2) Pouring consistency:</strong> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.
<br><strong>3) Thin consistency:</strong> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.
<br><strong>4) Frozen consistency:</strong> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.
<br>
<br>
<strong><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Fibre</strong> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.
<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components. The amount of fiber varies in different vegetables, for example, tomatoes and spinach have fewer fibers than turnips or carrots. Even the age of vegetables would determine the amount of fiber in it, for example, young baby carrots would have less fiber as compared to older tougher carrots. In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.
<br>
<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the
cooking time.
<br>
<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.
<br><br><strong>Sugars</strong> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>Starch</strong> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.
<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.
<br>
<br><strong>Doneness</strong> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.
<br>
<br><em>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:
</em><em><br></em><br>● Do not overcook.
<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.
<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.
<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.
<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.
<br>
<br><em>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:
</em><em><br></em><br>● Cooking for a short time.
<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.
<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.
<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.
<br>
<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.
<br>
<br><em>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:
</em><em><br></em><br>● High heat or temperature
<br>● Long cooking
<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching
<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)
<br>
<br><em>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:
</em><br>
<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.
<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.
<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.
<br>
<br><strong>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION
</strong><br><strong>1) Washing:</strong> to remove dirt.
<br><strong>2) Peeling:</strong> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.
<br><strong>3) Pairing:</strong> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.
<br><strong>4) Cutting:</strong> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)
<br><strong>5) Mincing:</strong> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.
<br><strong>6) Shredding:</strong> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.
<br><strong>7) Slicing:</strong> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.
<br><strong>8) Slitting:</strong> example green chilies.
<br><strong>9) Grating:</strong> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.
<br><strong>10) Grinding:</strong> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.
<br><strong>11) Mashing:</strong> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.
<br><strong>12) Pressing:</strong> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.
<br><strong>13) Sieving:</strong> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.
<br><strong>14) Refining:</strong> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.
<br><strong>15) Skimming:</strong> removing a floating layer.
<br><strong>16) Rendering:</strong> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.
<br><strong>17) Filtration:</strong> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.
<br><strong>18) Evaporation and reduction:</strong> removal of water without the lid.
<br><strong>19) Homogenization:</strong> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).
<br><strong>20) Emulsification:</strong> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.
<br>
<br><strong>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:
</strong><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.
<br>
<br><strong>1) Beating:</strong> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.
<br><strong>2) Blending:</strong> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.
<br><strong>3) Cutting:</strong> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.
<br><strong>4) Creaming:</strong> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual
incorporation of sugar as in cake making.
<br><strong>5) Folding:</strong> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.
<br><strong>6) Kneading</strong>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.
<br><strong>7) Marinating:</strong> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.
<br><strong>8) Stirring:</strong> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.
<br><strong>9) Whipping:</strong> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>
