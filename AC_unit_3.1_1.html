</strong><br>In simple words, a salad is a composition of ingredients that can be raw, cooked, or cold, usually served with a dressing, and eaten as an appetizer or as a main course. The word ‘salad’ originated from the Latin word <strong><em>sal</em></strong>, meaning salt. Salads are generally served as an accompaniment to a dish but can be served as a course itself, an appetizer, sweet course(fruit salad).
<br>Salads have come a long way since ancient Roman times, but even till date, a salad will always
comprise the following:
<br>
<br><strong>THE SALAD COMPRISES OF FOUR PARTS
</strong><br>Base
<br>Body
<br>Dressing
<br>Garnish
<br>
<br><strong>Base
</strong><br>The salad is built up on the base. Common bases include iceberg cups, chiffonade of lettuce, to the
more contemporary bases such as noodles, avocado halves, and pineapples. The main purpose is to keep the plate or bowl from looking bare and to provide contrast colour to the other parts of the salad.
<br>
<br><strong>Body
</strong><br>It is the most important part of the salad and is placed on top of the base. It is the most substantial part that can comprise various ingredients, thus giving the salad its name. The body may include a variety of ingredients such as fish in a tuna salad or apples in a Waldorf salad. Body constituents are the major portion of the salad.
<br>
<br><strong>Dressing
</strong><br>Dressing is used to moisten and add flavour to the salad. It helps to reduce the excessive bitterness that some salad leaves may have. It can be served by the side or tossed with the salad. It should be added towards the end or as close to the service time as possible. It adds flavour, provides food value, helps in digestion and improves palatability and appearance. A dressing is in a liquid or semi liquid form.
<br>
<br><strong>Garnish
</strong><br>Garnish is of prime importance in any salad; it is the focal point of the salad and gives the salad its
distinctive nature. It provides the salad with colour, contrast, and elevation. Common garnishes are
chopped walnuts, crostini, fresh herb sprigs, fresh sprouted seed leaves, any of the fruit and vegetables,cut into simple, appropriate shapes, may be used as garnish.
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF SALADS
</strong><br>Salads are of three types:
<br>
<br>● Simple Salads
<br>● Compound Salads
<br>● Tossed Salads
<br>
<br><strong>Simple Salads
</strong><br>These salads comprise only one primary ingredient, which makes up the body. with one or two other
ingredients that make up the garnish. These salads are usually tossed with a dressing and one must use ingredients that are grown fresh during the season. 
<br><strong><em>Examples:
</em></strong><br>● Celery salad: chopped celery with vinaigrette.
<br>● Cabbage salad: shredded cabbage with vinaigrette.
<br>● Cucumber salad: cucumber roundels with vinaigrette.
<br>
<br><strong>Compound Salads
</strong><br>Compound salads are very elaborate in nature and can vary depending on the skill and the imagination of the chef. They comprise more than one ingredient and can be classified as follows depending on the ingredient used in the body:
<br>● Fish based
<br>● Fruit based
<br>● Meat based
<br>● Vegetable based
<br>● Miscellaneous salads
<br>
<br><strong>Tossed Salads
</strong><br>This is a type of salad where varieties of cooked vegetables, mushrooms, truffles, meats, fish or shellfish etc. are tossed up together with a dressing. Many of the compound salads are also tossed salads. but they are classical and hence, form a different category. All the other creative salads, which are tossed together. will fall in the tossed category.
<br>
<br><strong>Various types of Lettuce used in salads
</strong><br><strong><br></strong><br><strong><em>Iceberg:
</em></strong><br>One of the most popular lettuce varieties, it gives a very crisp bite. It’s found very commonly in all supermarkets.
<br><strong><em>Radicchio:
</em></strong><br>The leaves have deep red to pink colour with white ribbing. It can be eaten raw in a salad, grilled with olive oil or stuffed
<br><strong><em>Romaine:
</em></strong><br>It’s used in the famous caesar salad. It has very good flavour and crunchy texture.
<br><strong><em>Bibb Lettuce:
</em></strong><br>This is also called butter head lettuce and it’s not commonly available and hence, it is very expensive.
<br><strong><em>Mizuna:
</em></strong><br>The leaves are bright green in colour and have serrated edges, They are a great addition to tossed green salad.
<br><strong><em>Dandelions:
</em></strong><br>These leaves are used in salad to give it a sharp to bitter flavour. The younger leaves can be eaten raw in a salad.
<br><strong><em>Frisée:
</em></strong><br>These are curry lettuce, with long tender leaves that are attached to a whitish stem. The tip of the leaves have a serrated edge.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>SALAD DRESSING
</strong><br>The salient features of salad dressing are as follows:
<br>● Dressing heightens the flavour and improves the food value.
<br>● It is usually in a liquid or semi-liquid form, which helps in improving the appearance of the salad.
<br>● The dressing should complement the ingredients being used.
<br>● The modern concept of using flavoured oils and reducing the use of fruit juice and extracts in salads is a trend that is fast catching up.
<br><br><em>Dressings can be classified as follows:
</em><br><strong>Oil-based Dressings
</strong><br>These dressings are temporary emulsions consisting of olive oil and vinegar, commonly called vinaigrette. The dressing can be made in bulk and kept for later use.
However, the oil and vinegar/water separate, with the oil rising to the surface, on standing. Such dressings therefore need to be whisked just before application. Oil-based dressings are best held/stored at near room temperature. The guidelines given below should be followed when making, holding, and applying vinaigrette products:
<br><br>● For production, choose good quality ingredients, namely oil, vinegar, fresh herbs, and flavourings.
<br>● Prepare and mix dressings well in advance allowing the flavours to fully infuse with each other.
<br>● Hold/store prepared oil-based dressings at near room temperature for best results. Holding in the fridge will cause the emulsion to separate.
<br>● Always re-emulsify the dressings (by agitation or whisking) just before use to ensure the dressing is thoroughly blended together.
<br>● Ensure the ingredients being favoured/moistened have been properly prepared before the dressing is applied, otherwise the dressing will not coat the salad.
<br> ● Do not use excessive amounts of dressing. The tossing technique is an ideal way of achieving this requirement.
<br>
<br><strong>Fresh Cream-based Dressings
</strong><br>These kinds of dressings are prepared using fresh cream. The cream is used to moisten the salad and add to the food value. Cream-based dressings have to be stored under refrigeration and have a very short shelf life.
<br>
<br><strong>Mayonnaise-based Dressings
</strong><br>Mayonnaise is one of the most popular salad dressings used. It is highly versatile and goes well with fruit-, fish-, and vegetable-based salads. It should always be stored under refrigerated conditions and should be made in smal] quantities. Mayonnaise can also be flavoured by adding ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, basil, mustard, etc. to make variations. 
<br>Mayonnaise is a relatively stable emulsion, conditions may arise that will cause prepared mayonnaise to break or separate into an unacceptable product of curdled appearance. To prevent this from happening, it should be stored in a suitable sealed container in cool conditions.
<br>
<br><strong>Natural Yoghurt Dressings
</strong><br>Yogurt-based dressings are healthy and thus popular in today’s time. It provides a lighter product with a piquant taste that is so desirable in salads.
<br>
<br><strong>Other Dressings
</strong><br><strong><em>Russian dressing:</em></strong> mayonnaise, chilly sauce,horseradish,minced onion.
<br><strong><em>Lemon dressing:</em></strong> same as vinaigrette dressing using lemon juice instead of vinegar.
<br><strong><em>Thousand island dressing:</em></strong> mayonnaise, hard boiled eggs, tomato ketchup, chopped gherkins, chopped onions, pimentos, olives and paprika powder.
<br>
<br><strong>SALIENT FEATURES OF PREPARING GOOD SALADS
</strong><br>The possible permutations and combinations of ingredients used in the preparation of salads are almost unlimited and this can give wide scope to the person entrusted with their preparation. It does, however, require and understanding of the compatibility of ingredients and for colour, balance, and presentation. Thus, attention should be given to careful decoration and garnishing of all salads; a good colour balance is essential for mixed or composed salads using a number of different ingredients. Care should be given to the following points:
<br>
<br>● All raw salad ingredients should be fresh and of good quality.
<br>● All leaf salad vegetables should be carefully trimmed of all discoloured or damaged leaves and roots, then washed in cold water, drained, and dried thoroughly.
<br>● Large salad leaves are best if carefully torn into manageable-sized pieces instead of cutting with a knife.
<br>● Use the core part of the lettuce often referred to as ‘hearts of the lettuce’ wherever possible, as this part is very crisp and offers a natural crunch to the salad.
<br>● The cutting of vegetables, either raw or cooked, should be carried out as evenly and neatly as possible. This is essential for a good presentation.
<br>● Some items, such as avocado, pears, small raw artichokes, and some fruits like banana, tend to discolour quickly when cut. This can be prevented by preparing them at the last minute and using a lemon-based dressing. Alternatively, they may be sprinkled first with a little lemon juice.
<br>● Always mix the salad with dressing at the last minute or the salad can become limp and loose its texture.
