                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Building Transport System
</strong><br>
<br>Most multi storied hotels have many floors above the ground floor and also one/two floors below the ground floor.  Hence appropriate and efficient building transport systems are not only important but necessary also for operation.The systems should be a mix of manual and automatic operations. 
<br>
<br>There are two types of building transport system namely Vertical Transport System and Horizontal Transport System.
<br>
<br><strong>A. Vertical Transport System
</strong><br>1. Stairs
<br>2. Elevators / Lifts
<br>3. Escalators (Moving Stairs)
<br>4. Gravity Chutes (for goods)
<br>5. Dumbwaiter<br>
<br><strong>Stairs
</strong><br>This is the most common and essential for vertical movement of people and goods. It is also mandatory as it is an escape route in case of fire in buildings. In case of power failure, lifts do not operate and hence stair case is the only alternative for vertical movement. It must be fire proof so that guests can safely exit to upper and lower building floors. Provision of hand rails and non-slip steps are recommended for safety purpose.
<br><br><strong>Elevators
</strong><br>An elevator is a transportation device used to transport people and goods vertically. Elevators are generally automatic safety units for up and down transport purpose. It consists of a platform travelling in vertical guides in a shaft with hoisting and lowering mechanism and a source of power. The enclosure moving up and down in the guides is known as car.
<br>There are two types of lift systems.
<br>* Cable elevators – They are more common because they are fast, smooth and quite.
<br>* Hydraulic elevators - are elevators which are powered by a piston that travels inside a cylinder. An electric motor pumps hydraulic oil into the cylinder to move the piston. The piston smoothly lifts the elevator cab/car. They are used when the number of floors to be serviced is less. The elevators require regular inspection and maintenance and generally have a life of 20 years.
<br><br><strong>Escalators
</strong><br>The term escalator is a combination of elevator and “scala” the latin word for steps. Escalators are the moving step type lifts operating at constant speed between two levels in an inclined course for moving large number of people in a short time. It consists of a staircase whose steps move up and down on tracks which keep them horizontal. Most escalators also have a moving handrail which approximately keeps pace with the movement of the steps. The direction of movement (up and down) can be permanently the same or can be controlled by operators according to the requirement. Generally two units are required side-by-side at each level, one moving upward and the other downward.
<br>Gravity Chutes
<br>Gravity chutes are used by hotels for transporting soiled linen, garbage and waste from different floors of the hotel to an outlet point (generally kept on the ground floor). It is an efficient system as minimum power is involved in operating it. Gravity chutes save workers motion, time and increase their productivity.
<br><br><strong>Dumbwaiter</strong><br>A dumbwaiter is a small freight elevator or lift intended to carry food. Dumbwaiters found within modern structures, including both commercial, public and private buildings, are often connected between multiple floors. When installed in restaurants, schools, hospitals, retirement homes or in private homes, the lifts generally terminate in a kitchen.<br><br><strong><em>a) Hand Operated Dumbwaiters</em></strong>
<br>
<br>Hand operated dumbwaiters, as you might have guessed, are operated manually.  You operate the controls yourself in order to raise or lower the dumbwaiter.  They are surprisingly easy to use as they have an intricate combination of gears, brakes, and counterbalances which means you need to use very little effort and they are also very safe.  The automatic brake system that is included means that you’ll never accidentally drop the dumbwaiter as you are using it!  hand operated dumbwaiters have operating capacities of between 25 kilograms and 300 kilograms so you are sure to find one that suits your needs. They generally come in standardised sizes but you can have them custom made if you need.
<br><br><strong><em>b) Electrically Operated Dumbwaiters
</em></strong><br>Electrically operated dumbwaiters are nearly foolproof as they operate with just the push of a button. They use either the standard 240 volts, or they can operate using 415 volts.  Three phase power is most commonly required but single phase power options are becoming more common.  The equipment necessary to operate the dumbwaiter such as the motor, controller, gearbox and pulleys is hidden in a control box.  In some cases, the motor and equipment will need to be below floor level but many modern dumbwaiters have an all in one shaft so there is no need to excavate the fit the motor in.<br><br><strong><em>* Window Type Dumbwaiter</em></strong> – these are our most popular option. They’re small goods lifts that are installed at chest height for easily loading goods by hand. They’re most often used for the transport of food from the kitchens to the table, goods from the warehouse to the store, and books, or documents from one floor to another.
<br><strong><em>* Floor Type Dumbwaiter</em></strong> – these are installed where there are goods that need to be loaded onto a forklift, or pallet truck. They are most often used for the movement of bulky items such as laundry, furniture for public events, or boxes of documentation for conference venues.
<br><strong><em>* Goods Lift Dumbwaiter</em></strong> – this is a larger model, and it looks more like a traditional elevator. It features a modular structure with a self-supporting design, which means it’s easy to install as it doesn’t need a pit and shaft. The controls are on the outside because these lifts are not designed to carry people under any circumstances.<strong><br></strong><br><br><strong>B. Horizontal Transport System
</strong><br>1. Conveyor belts (moving sidewalk, moving walk way or travellator)
<br>2. Electric cars
<br>3. Manual trolley for transportation of luggage.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Travellators (Moving pavements)
</em></strong><br>Travellators also known as horizontal moving sidewalks, moving walkways is a slow speed conveyor belt to transport people, they can walk along or stand on it.
<br>They are often installed in pairs, for movement in opposite direction. Travellators may be used when there is substantial distance between the hotel entry point and the reception point.
<br><strong><em>Electric Cars</em></strong>
<br>Electric car is an electrically operated open car with 6 to 8 seats. This is an alternative to travellators and particularly very useful for disabled persons.
<br><strong><em>Manual Trolley
</em></strong><br>Manual trolley is used for transportation of luggage of guest.<br></p>
