Both customers and businesses can benefit from advances in communication, reservations and guest services systems. Technology allows continuous communication and streamlines the guest experience, from reservation to checkout.
<br>
<br><strong>What is a Hotel PMS?
</strong><br>A hotel property management system (PMS) is a set of solutions that hoteliers use to manage their day-to-day hotel operations activities such as reservations, front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, billing and invoicing, analytics and reporting. All of these activities can be labour and time-intensive, so the goal of a modern (Cloud-Based) PMS system is to save hotel managers and their employees time and money.
<br>In recent years, property management systems have increased their capabilities and moved beyond just completing basic front-office tasks. With a PMS system, you can now offer loyalty programs to guests, gather and analyze data, manage food and beverage services and more. But many hotels still rely on outdated and time-consuming methods to manage their property. Running a hotel is a complex business, and it’s important to stay on top of the latest technology to get ahead in a competitive market. Using a modern PMS can help you stay ahead of your competitors and make sure that your guests have a great experience.

<br>
<br><strong>Back Office Module
</strong><br>The back office module provides an integrated system for managing the hotel's financial and statistical information. It simplifies accounting processes such as posting of accounts payable, transfer of accounts receivables, compilation of the payroll, budget preparation, and the production of the hotel's profit-and-loss statement and balance sheet. The financial information entered on a terminal in back office updates all accounting records. The back office module is also linked with the night audit module, which helps in streamlining the accounting process.
<br>
<br><strong>PMS INTERFACE WITH STAND-ALONE SYSTEMS
</strong><br>When the PMS is integrated with other stand-alone automation systems like points of sale, energy management system, call accounting system, and electronic locking system, it becomes more effective and useful for hotel operations.
<br>
<br>1. Point of Sales In a hotel, the points of sale (POS) are the products/services other than accommodation from where the hotel generates revenue. These include restaurants, bars, discotheque, night club, health center, etc. Each point of sale is equipped with a stand-alone automated support for billings. If this is linked with the PMS, the data is immediately transferred to other modules for further processing. For example, a resident guest's credit sale in a restaurant will be immediately transferred to the cashier module, where it will be posted in the respective guest folio.
<br>2. Call Accounting System Hotels provide telephone facility to their guests. The resident guests can make local as well as long distance calls from the comfort of their rooms. The call accounting system is a stand-alone automated system, which tracks all outgoing and incoming calls. It has the following features: identification of outward dialing, automatic route selection, and call rating programme. When the call accounting system is integrated with the PMS interface, the calls are automatically posted in the respective caller's account.
<br>3. Energy Management System An energy management system is designed to manage the operations of equipment’s and instruments that consume energy. One typical function would be to shut down the operations of equipment’s that are not is use; for example, when a guest locks his room with the electronic key, the weather control system and lights are automatically turned off.
<br>4. Electronic Locking System The electronic locking system is used widely nowadays. This system helps the hotels to control access to guest rooms. Only a person with the proper card key coded for the specific room can enter that room. When the electronic locking system is networked with the PMS, the front desk person is able to code the room keys for the guests. The coding is such that the key will become non-functional after the check-out time on the date of departure.
<br>

<br>    8. Holiday Inn Worldwide
<br>
<br><strong>Points to consider while selecting a PMS
</strong><br>1. Budget: Budget must be a consideration while selecting a Property Management System for your hotel. A small hotel may want to opt for a local, lesser known brand for the cost constraints while bigger hotels may opt for well known brands as they can afford it.
<br>2. Brand: Well known PMS brands are considered reliable which may help bigger hotels to decide upon selecting hotel management software based on their brand image.
<br>3. Cost of Operation: The hardware (computer, printer, back-up discs etc) used by the PMS should be replaceable at a reasonable cost. Costs for operating supplies, such as paper and cartridges should also be reasonable. Systems that require such hardware part which cannot be obtained economically, readily and locally should be avoided.
<br>4. Ease of Installation: Hotel’s operate 24hrs a day and 7 days a week, so any disruption in the continuous operation of its PMS can affect the hotel and its guests. Before selecting a new PMS, the FOM should thoroughly investigate the amount of time required in the installation of the new system. Installation time and its actual cost must be a common consideration in the selection of a new PMS.
<br>5. Ease of Use: New Front Office employees must learn how to use the PMS. The ease with which they can learn the system is a factor in reducing training costs and increasing the pace at which new employees become comfortable operating the system.
<br>6. Ease of Interface Integration: Information needed by FOMs to professionally manage Front Office comes from a variety of sources. Hotels use many automatic systems like card-key machines, telephone systems which must interface with the PMS for operational utility and efficiency.
<br>7. Maintenance Requirements: Like any other hotel equipment, the PMS must be properly maintained to operate efficiently. The cost of effective preventive maintenance may vary from one PMS to another. The FOM must determine and understand the time and money required to minimize down time and to maximize system efficiency by providing routine, ongoing maintenance.
<br>8. Ease and Frequency of Upgrading: Technology advances at a fast pace. Hardware and software upgrades are routinely issued by manufacturers, and most of these significantly improve the operational effectiveness of a PMS. FOMs should anticipate significant increases in demand for up gradation, memory, and speed and should provide for the same at the time of procurement.
<br>9. Quality and Availability of Support Services: A PMS is a computerized system and is vulnerable to hardware malfunctioning, software glitches, and potentially damaging intrusive viruses. Support services personnel, preferably via a toll free telephone number must be accessible on a 24 hrs and 7 days basis.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits of Using Hotel Management System
</strong><br>Year of 2000, as many as 25% of Indian hotels still reported using pen and paper or Excel spreadsheets to manage all of their front-office tasks like room bookings, billing, and room availability. This can be an inefficient way to do things in the long run. And what would happen if your spreadsheet or paper records got lost or destroyed?
<br>Using a hotel management system can save you time by automating recurring tasks like updating room rates and availability, sending out reminder emails to guests prior and upon arrival, and invoicing your guests. You can also connect your property management system to a channel manager so that you can take bookings on various channels online, and they will all arrive in your PMS, so you have a way to easily keep track of them all in one place. With a PMS system, your staff spends less time on administrative tasks and more time on satisfying your guests.
<br>Using a modern hotel management system can increase your revenue by tracking your performance and gathering data about your hotel, analyzing it, and creating reports. From there, you’ll be able to see a clear overview of how your hotel is doing, and you can use this data to make better decisions about how to run the business. For example, you can use your property management system to adopt a dynamic pricing strategy, so you can keep more of your rooms filled at rates that make the customer happy.
