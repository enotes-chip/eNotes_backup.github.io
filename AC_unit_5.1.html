</strong><br>Raising agents are also known as leavening agents. Leavening is the production or incorporation of gases in a baked product to increase volume and to produce taste and texture as well as shape. These gases must be retained in the product until the structure is set enough by the coagulation of gluten and /or egg protein to hold its shape. Exact measurement of leavening agents is important, because small changes can produce major defects in baked products.
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF RAISING/LEAVENING AGENTS
</strong><br>• <strong>Biological:</strong> Yeast
<br>• <strong>Chemical:</strong> Baking powder, Baking soda, Baking ammonia
<br>• <strong>Mechanical:</strong> Air, Steam
<br>
<br><strong>YEAST
</strong><br>Fermentation is the process by which yeast acts on carbohydrates and changes them into carbon dioxide and alcohol. This release of gas produces the leavening action in yeast products. The alcohol evaporates completely during and immediately after baking. The process of fermentation is brought about by an enzyme called zymase. Yeast is a microscopic plant. As a living organism, it is sensitive to temperatures.
<br><br>➜ 45°F (7°C) Inactive; storage temperature 
<br>➜ 60-70°F (15-20°C) Slow action
<br>➜ 70-90°F (20-32°C) Best growth, proofing temperature for dough
<br>➜ Above 100°F (38°C) Reaction slows
<br>➜ 140°F (60°C) Yeast is killed
<br>
<br>Yeast will contribute to flavour in addition to leavening action. There are various market forms of yeast, which are available. Dried Yeast: is a mixture of yeast and corn flour or cornmeal, which are pressed into cakes and dried. The yeast continues to live, but in an inactive state. When furnished with warmth and moisture, it begins to develop and multiply, but this process is slow. Dried yeast has to be soaked in lukewarm water and mixed with very soft dough for a preliminary period before the other ingredients are added.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Activated Dried Yeast:</em></strong> This develops more rapidly than dried yeast and is the type that is most commonly used these days. It can be added straight into the flour. It is also less perishable than compressed yeast (see below). The shelf life of both dry and activated dry yeast is longer when stored in the refrigerator.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Compressed Yeast:</em></strong> This is a moist mixture of yeast plants and starch. The yeast remains active and will grow and multiply rapidly when added to dough. It has to be kept refrigerated and will keep well only for a few days. If held in the freezer, it retains its activity for a longer period.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>CHEMICAL LEAVENERS
</strong><br>Chemical leaveners are those that release gases produced by chemical reactions.
<br>
<br><strong>Baking Soda</strong>&nbsp;is the chemical sodium bicarbonate. If moisture and acid are present, soda releases carbon dioxide gas, which will leaven the product. Heat is not necessary for the reaction, although the gas will be released at a faster rate if the temperature is increased. For this reason, products leavened with soda must be baked immediately otherwise the gases will escape and the leavening power will be reduced. Acids that react with soda in a batter or dough would include honey, molasses, buttermilk, fruits, cocoa and chocolate. Sometimes,  acids, such as cream of tartar are added to induce the production of carbon dioxide.
<br>
<strong><br>Baking Powder</strong> is a mixture of baking soda and an acid such as cream of tartar and diluted with cornflour to give a product of the desired strength. The cornflour also serves to separate the acid and the base, thereby increasing the stability of the mixture. General proportions used are 1 to 2 tsps /500 GMS of the flour or foundation ingredients. Baking powders are more versatile since they do not depend on acids for their leavening power. Do not include more baking powder in a recipe, as it will create an undesirable flavour.
<br>
<br><strong>Baking Ammonia</strong> is the chemical ammonium carbonate. It decomposes during baking to form carbon dioxide gas and ammonia gas. Only heat and moisture are required for it to work. No acid is required for reaction to take place. Baking ammonia releases gases very quickly and can only be used in small products like cookies or in products like choux pastry where rapid leavening is desired. Because it decomposes quickly, it leaves no residue, which could affect the flavour.
<br>
<br><strong>MECHANICAL AGENTS
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Air&nbsp;</strong>is incorporated in a batter primarily by two methods. This air expands during baking and will leaven the product.
<br><em>1. Creaming –</em> is the process of beating fat and sugar together. Besides breaking up the fat into minute particles, it also incorporates air into the mixture. It is an important technique in cake making and in cookie making as well. Some pound cakes and cookies are aerated entirely by this method.
<br><em>2. Foaming –</em> is the process of beating eggs, with or without sugar, to incorporate air. Foams made with whole eggs are used for sponge cakes, while meringues, angel food cakes and soufflés are aerated with only egg whites.
<br>
<br><strong>Steam </strong>when water turns to steam, it expands to 1600 times its original volume. Because all baked products contain some moisture, steam is an important leavening agent. Bakery products such as eclairs and cream puffs rely on steam for aerating. If the starting temperature for the baking of these products are high, steam will be produced and rapidly aerate the product. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Flour
</strong><br>Wheat is among the most extensively cultivated cereal crops in the world; it is a member of the grass family and is botanically named Triticum. It is an annual or biennial crop that grows in the temperate regions
of the world. Commercially, wheat is classified into three broader sections:
<br>
<br>1. Triticum vulgare, used for making bakers flour
<br>2. Triticum durum, used for making pastas
<br>3. Triticum compactum, also known as clubbed wheat is used for making low gluten flours
<br>
<br>Four is obtained when we mill grains and pulses. The milling can be of various degrees to give a&nbsp;particular structure to the product and the usage of each milled product will be different from one
another. For example, the milling of wheat grain can produce bulgar, couscous, semolina, and flour.
When in bakery we refer to Four, we always mean the refined flour, unless specified as wholemeal Four of any other name for reference.
<br>
<br><strong>By-products of wheat
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Wholemeal flour
</strong><br>This is also called as atta in India, and it's the whole milled wheat kernel. The flour is cream to brown in colour as it has the bran grounded with it. It's not advisable to sift the whole wheat flour as you will lose most of the bran, which is an important dietary component. 
<br>
<br><strong>Strong flour
</strong><br>These are milled from hard flour, in other words, from high protein flours. The strong flours absorb more water than weak flours, as gluten can absorb twice their own weight of water. This flour is used for products that will have a high rise in the oven such as—yeast breads, choux pastry, and puff pastry. Strong flour is also known as baker's flour.
<br>
<br><strong>Weak Flour
</strong><br>Weak flour is also known as soft flour or cake flour. As the name suggests, this flour has less gluten and hence, these are used for products that need a softer texture such as cookies and cakes and sponges.
<br>
<br><strong>All-purpose flour
</strong><br>The all-purpose flour is a blend of flours and has medium strength. In India, all the refined flour that we get is all-purpose flour only.
<br>
<br><strong>Cake flour 
</strong><br>Refer to weak flour.
<br>
<br><strong>Pastry flour</strong> 
<br>They are produced from very finely ground polished soft wheat kernels usually enriched and bleached.
<br>
<br><strong>Self-raising flour
</strong><br>This flour is usually of medium strength and contains baking powder in a proportion. Since the flour contains moisture, this can react with the baking powder; thus lessening the effect of baking powder and hence, it is not advisable to buy the commercial self-raising flour. It is advisable to use 60 gms of baking powder to 1 kg flour to make itself raising. This flour is commonly used to make afternoon cookies called scones.
