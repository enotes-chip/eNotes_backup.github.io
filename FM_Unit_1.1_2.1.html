</strong><br>
<br>Nowadays, there are many changes has been occurred in the fields like industry, computer as well as software. They have contributed significant progress in all different sectors. By pushing the switch or button, you call a metal box that transports you from one floor to another with safely. In fact, an elevator is mandatory for a building which has more than four to five floors high. For most of the people, an elevator offer ease as well as convenience, and also makes life easier for physically handicapped persons. This article discusses what is the elevator, how does it work and types.
<br>
<br><strong>What is Elevator (Lift)?
</strong><br>An elevator can be defined as an electric lift which is used as vertical transportation of goods as well as people among the floors in buildings using bins otherwise silos. As usual, these are activated with the electrical motors that also to drive counterweight system cables for drive transaction such as a hoist, otherwise, pump hydraulic fluid for raising a cylindrical piston such as a jack.
<br>
<br><strong>How Does a Lift work?
</strong><br>The working principle of an elevator or lift is similar to the pulley system. A pulley system is used to draw the water from the well. This pulley system can be designed with a bucket, a rope with a wheel. A bucket is connected to a rope that passes throughout a wheel. This can make it very easy to draw the water from the well. Similarly, present elevators use the same concept. But the main difference between these two are; pulley systems are operated manually whereas an elevator uses sophisticated mechanisms for handling the elevator’s load.
<br>Basically, an elevator is a metal box in different shapes which is connected to a very tough metal rope. The tough metal rope passes through a sheave on the elevator in the engine room. Here a sheave is like a wheel in pulley system for clutching the metal rope strongly. This system can be operated by a motor. When the switch is turned ON, the motor can be activated when the elevator goes up and down or stops.
<br>The elevator can be constructed with various elevator Components or elevator parts that mainly include speed controlling system, electric motor, rails, cabin, shaft, doors (manual and automatic), drive unit, buffers, and safety device.
<br>
<br><strong>Different Types of Elevator
</strong><br>The different types of lifts or elevators include building lift, capsule lift, hydraulic elevator, pneumatic elevator, passenger lift, freight elevator, traction elevator/cable driven, residential elevators, machine room-less elevator, etc.
<br><br><strong>1) Hydraulic Elevator
</strong><br>A hydraulic elevator is power-driven by a piston that moves within a cylinder. The piston movement can be done by pumping hydraulic oil to the cylinder. The piston lifts the lift cab easily, and the oil can be controlled by an electrical valve.
<br>The applications of hydraulic elevators involve in five to six-floor buildings. The operating of these elevators can be done at speeds up to 200 ft or 61 meters for each minute. All the current hydraulic pumps are designed with a mechanical Y-delta starter otherwise solid state contractor. For the power supply of motor as well as building, solid-state starters are superior. Because the winding stay longer as well as there is no voltage drop across the building power supply.  In Y-delta type starter, the motor can be activated by using two contractors on a decreased speed, after that continues with full speed. Older hydraulic elevators now started up suddenly, transmitting mains power at full-blast right into the electric motor. This sets a lot of damage on the motor, which will make it burn out quicker than motors on Solid-State or Y-Delta Contactor starters. The hydraulic elevators are classified into four types such as holed, hole less &amp; roped elevators 
<br>
<br><strong>2) Pneumatic Elevator
</strong><br>The pneumatic elevator can be designed with an external cylinder, and the cylinder is a crystal clear self-supporting cylinder. This cylinder includes modular sections to fit effortlessly into one by one. The top of this tube is designed with steel material that ensures tight air shutting by suction valves as well as inlets. A lift car runs within the cylinder, &amp; the head unit on the top cylinder surface consists of valves, controllers, and turbines for controlling the elevator movements.
<br>Pneumatic elevators are very easy to fit, operate as well as maintain when compared with the traditional elevators. These are used in existing homes because of their solid design. The main benefits of using these elevators include solid design &amp; smooth, speed and flexibility, energy efficient and very safe.
<br>
<br><strong>3) Cable Driven or Traction Elevator
</strong><br>The traction elevator or cable driven elevators are the most popular elevators. It consists of steel cables as well as hoisting ropes that run above a pulley which is connected to the motor. This is geared otherwise gear-less-traction type elevator. In this kind of elevator, several wire and hoisting cables are connected to the surface of an elevator car with covering around it on sheaves at one end &amp; the other side is connected to a counterweight that travels up &amp; down on its guide rails. The counterweight is equivalent to the car’s weight and half of the weight of the passenger in the car. This means, throughout the lifting process it needs extra power for the additional passengers in the car; the rest of the load is managed with the weight of the counter. When the control system is connected to the lift, then it drives the motors in a frontward way, and sheave turns around to move the car lift upwards and stops in the preferred floor where the car is controlled by the weight of the counter. 
<br>For the car downstairs movement, overturn occurs during a rotating motor through a control method. For conserving the energy, some types of lift use electric motors with four quadrant operation in the regenerative method. Because of the high rise as well as high-speed capacities, these are applicable in several escalators, lifts, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>4) Capsule Lift
</strong><br>Capsule lift or Elevators are used in prestigious buildings, which can be called as decoration of a building because they improve the building’s beauty as well as carries life into it.
<br>The main features of this elevators mainly include design, and travel comfort is best. The interior design of these lifts is attractive with a large glass panel for viewing. The ultramodern design of these lifts offers a cosmic zone travel experience for the passengers. These lifts are consistent and inexpensive with the least maintenance.
<br>
<br><strong>5) Building Lift
</strong><br>A building lift is a vertical transportation among the floors of the building. These are frequently used in public buildings, complexes, offices, and multistory building. These lifts are important in providing vertical movement, mostly in high buildings, for a wheelchair as well as other non-ambulant building customers. Some type of lifts also is applicable for emigration &amp; firefighting purposes.
<br>
<br><strong>6) Passenger Lift
</strong><br>This type of lift has entirely included a lift car that moves vertically in a specially equipped lift shaft. Passengers are traveled between the floors in the building at quick speed. The control systems in the lift frequently designed to offer the most economical sharing of passengers all over the building. These lifts are very space efficient which are used in existing buildings where space is at a best.
<br>The main advantages of using passenger lift give a very comfort traveling among different floors, particularly space efficient, fully fixed shaft, small construction works, and no level loading on the building.
<br>
<br><strong>7) Freight Elevator</strong>
<br>In the world of elevators, these lifts are workhorses. These are very useful for transporting materials, goods in warehouses, manufacturing industries, shopping malls, seaports, etc. This type of elevator is separated into classes, to describe their load capacity as well as application. These lifts are strong in nature, and they are specially manufactured by engineers.
<br>The features of this elevator include: the range of loading capacity is from 2500 lbs to 10000 lbs, height of the travel up to 50fts. The benefits of these elevators include; these elevators are designed for commercial as well as industrial applications. The flexible design to hold the application, door designs can be changed, eco-friendly, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>8) Residential Elevators
</strong><br>Residential elevators provide stylish options to the platform as well as stair lifts. These lifts can be effortlessly incorporated in any available home, otherwise incorporated in edifice plans for latest homes. These types of elevators are available in different styles, and these can be installed in your home walls, otherwise included effortlessly to improve your home’s decoration. The main benefits of residential elevators are; they can move you securely among floors even during a power failure. Quick installation and offers you an effortless life.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>B. Escalator Working principle:
</strong><br>
<br>1. The core parts of the escalator are two chains, which rotate around two pairs of gears. At the top of the escalator, an electric motor drives the transmission gear to rotate the chain ring. A typical escalator USES a 100 horsepower engine to turn the gears. The engine and chain systems are mounted in trusses, which are metal structures that extend from floor to floor.
<br>2. Unlike the conveyor belt moving a plane, the chain ring moves a set of steps. The most interesting thing about escalators is the way they move. The steps remain level as the chain moves. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the steps fold into a platform. This makes it easier to get up and down the escalator.
<br>3. Each step of the escalator has two sets of wheels, which rotate along two separate tracks. The top gear (wheels near the top of the steps) is connected to a rotating chain and is pulled by a drive gear located at the top of the escalator. The other wheels simply slide along the track behind the first wheels.
<br>4. The two tracks are separated from each other, so that each step can be kept level. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the track is in a horizontal position, flattening the steps. There are a series of grooves inside each step to connect the front and rear steps during the leveling process.
<br>5. Besides rotating the main link, the motor in the escalator can also move the handrails. The armrest is just a rubber conveyor belt that circulates around a series of wheels. The conveyor belt is precisely configured to move at exactly the same speed as the steps, making the rider feel smooth.
<br>6. The escalator system is not capable of lifting people up dozens of floors as elevators do, but it is suitable for providing short distance transportation. This is because of the high load rate of escalators. When the elevator is full, no one else can get on until it reaches the designated floor and returns. On escalators, as long as one person reaches the top, it makes room for others.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The difference between an elevator and an escalator</strong><br>● Escalators are necessary “moving stairs” that carry the public up or down between levels of a building. But an elevator is a room type lift which holds a few people at one time and transports people up and down between levels of building. 
<br>● Elevators are used in multi storied buildings such as offices, apartments, banks, hospitals, etc. But escalators are used in malls, metro and railway stations, etc.
<br>● Elevators are closed cabins about Escalators are moving stairs. 
<br>● Escalator consists of a motor driven chain on an individual track which cycles on a pair of tracks. An elevator is a type of vertical transportation that moves people or goods between levels of a building. It is powered by an electric motor that attaches a traction cable and counterweight system just like a cylindrical piston.
<br>● Escalator are power boozers as they have to operate continuously, whereas elevators save electricity. 
<br>● Elevator can carry only 10 to 15 people at one time. But escalators can carry more than 20 people at one time.
<br>● Escalators are energy guzzlers as they have to operate continuously, whereas elevators consume electricity only when in operation. 
<br>● Patients, luggage, etc can’t travel in escalators but can travel in Elevator.
<br>● Escalator does not require a specific machine room to control the system of escalators. But elevators require a specific machine room to control the elevator.&nbsp;<br></p>
