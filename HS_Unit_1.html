</strong><br>Hygiene refers to the set of practices associated with the preservation of health and healthy living. In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent the spread of disease-causing harmful microorganisms. Since cleaning process removes infections - microbes as well as dirt and soil, they are often the means to achieve hygiene. It is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion of health because of the risk of food poisoning. Kitchen Hygiene refers to maintaining the cleanliness of Kitchen equipment’s, surroundings and including personal hygiene.
<br>
<br><strong>Sanitation
</strong><br>The word sanitation comes from the Latin word sanitas, which means “health”. Sanitation means creating and maintaining hygienic and healthful conditions. It is an applied science and relates physical, chemical, biological, and microbial principles to food, the environment and health. Sanitation is more than just cleanliness. Food or equipment can be free of visible dirt and still be contaminated with microorganisms or chemicals that can cause illness or food spoilage.
<br>Sanitary practices and hygienic conditions are becoming more and more important because food is being processed, prepared and sold in larger volumes than before. Some microorganisms cause food spoilage and food-borne illness, but others are beneficial in food processing and preparation. Sanitation can reduce the growth of microorganisms on equipment and dirt on food. This can reduce contamination of food by microorganisms that cause food-borne illness and food spoilage. Sanitary principles also apply to waste disposal and can help reduce pollution and improve ecological balance.
<br>
<br><strong>The benefits &amp; importance of a good sanitation program</strong>
<br>• Compliance with statutory regulations.
<br>• Preventing food-borne illness outbreaks.
<br>• Improving quality and shelf life of foods.

Food can transmit disease from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Rules regarding food hygiene are:
<br>
<br>• Prevent contaminating food with pathogens spreading from people, pets, and pests.
<br>• Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.
<br>• Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill temperature.

<br>
<br><strong>5. Nose: </strong>The nose should not be touched when food is being handled. Avoid sneezing or coughing near food. Use a disposable tissue to wipe the nose.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Mouth:</strong> Never touch the mouth or lips as germs in saliva pass from Fingers to food and table-tops. If food needs to be tasted during preparation, a clean spoon should be used and not the fingers or utensils used in preparation.

<br>
<br><br><strong>BASIC RULES TO BE OBSERVED WHILE FOOD SERVICE
</strong><br>
<br>A number of diseases can be spread due to unsanitary practices while serving food. These diseases
can be avoided by following certain basic rules of sanitation.
<br>
<br>Protecting food during service is very important. Food should be protected at all times from contamination by people, dust. flies as well as changes in temperature.
<br>
<br>1. Practice personal hygiene.
<br>
<br>2. Avoid handling food with your bare hands. Bread rolls, chapatis, papad, sugar cubes, salads,
cold cuts. cheese. ice and even garnishes should not be touched. Always use a pair of tongs, spoon or plastic gloves to pick up these foods.
<br>
<br>3. Maintain temperature control. Food that is to be held during a long lunch hour should be
kept at temperatures outside the danger zone. Potentially hazardous or high-risk foods may remain in the danger zone for a maximum period of four hours, after which they should be
held outside the danger zone.
<br>
<br>The temperature of food in the bain-marie or hot cupboard should be above 63°C and the temperature of food held in the refrigerated case should be 5 to 8°C or lower, depending on the nature of the food.
<br>
<br>4. Foods held on buffet tables must be kept at proper hot or cold holding temperatures. Check
the temperature of all foods with a probe thermometer.
<br>
<br>5. Do not re-serve leftovers that have been displayed on buffets. Foods on buffets remain on the table for several hours and are exposed to contamination by customers who may have coughed, sneezed or touched the food during the meal hour. The top portion of cold foods may get warmed by air and spoilage may begin. Therefore, after a buffet closes, consider all food articles on display contaminated and discard them.
<br>
<br>However, in a poor country like India, this rule is not practical and, therefore, the food handler should follow proper temperature control.
<br>
<br>6. Food which has once been served to a customer should never be re-served, for example, bread rolls, leftover butter, etc. Only foods that are not potentially hazardous and are packed or wrapped may be served again.
<br>
<br>7. Handle dishes and utensils in a sanitary manner. Plates should be held by the bottom or edge. cups by handles or bottoms, silverware by handles. Avoid touching the eating surface of crockery and cutlery.
<br>
<br>8. Single service items should be dispensed in such a way that customers remove one item at
a time without touching other items.
<br>
<br>9. Before food service begins, all service personnel should check serving dishes for any sign’
of soil or improper cleaning.
<br>
<br>10. Do not serve food in chipped or cracked dishes.
<br><br>
<br><strong>SPECIAL RULES FOR DINING ROOM WAITERS 
</strong><br>
<br>1. Avoid cross-contamination: Food and clean utensils may get contaminated by dirty plates and utensils if separate stations are not maintained for clean and dirty items. The waiter stations are reserved for clean utensils and food being served to customers, while side stands are reserved for used cutlery, crockery and garbage.
<br>
<br>Contamination may also occur when waiters serve food without washing their hands after wiping tables and bussing soiled dishes. These practices are harmful and workers must be made aware of the hazards.
<br>
<br>2. Clean and organise your waiter stations and do not use them to store personal belongings.
<br>
<br>3. Minimise handling of foods with your hands. Do not rearrange food on the plate unnecessarily,
<br>
<br>4. Avoid touching the food or mouth contact surface of utensils as bacteria from the fingers are easily transferred to food. Pick up utensils by the bottom, side or handles. Never pick up glasses or cups bv putting your fingers inside.
<br>
<br>5. Clean and sanitise all service utensils like plates, glasses, silverware, etc. Do not wipe it dry
with a cloth but allow it to air dry. Wiping with a towel or cloth will contaminate the wares.
<br>
<br>6. Store all service utensils correctly after they are sanitised. Flatware and serving utensils
should be placed face down. Place silverware in baskets with the cating ends down.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>SPECIAL RULES FOR BARTENDERS AND BAR WAITERS
</strong><br>1. Store and handle all drink mixes and food items properly. Keep drink mixes and cream refrigerated or on ice. Avoid handling cut fruit and cherries with bare hands. Wear plastic gloves while cutting fruit and use toothpicks to place the cut fruit in glasses. Keep fruit covered.
