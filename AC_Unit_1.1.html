</strong><strong><br></strong><br>Skills may be grouped into 3 general categories.
<br><strong>1) Supervisory level:</strong> The head of the food service, whether called executive chef or kitchen director, must have management and supervisory skills as well as a thorough knowledge of food production. He should be able to:
<br>● Organize and motivate people under him.
<br>● Planning menus and production procedures.
<br>● Controlling costs and managing budgets.
<br>● Purchasing food supplies &amp; equipment.
<br>● Must be an experienced chef in order to schedule food production.
<br>● Train and instruct workers.
<br>● Control quality.
<br>
<br><strong>2) Technical level:</strong> The cooks are the backbone of the kitchen. These workers carry out the actual food production. They must have knowledge of and experience in cooking techniques. They must be able to function well with their fellow workers and coordinate with other departments. Cooking food in hotels is a team activity.
<br>
<br><strong>3) Entry-level:</strong> this level of workers usually requires no particular skills &amp; experience. The jobs assigned to them are stewarding or basic pre-preparation of vegetables. As their knowledge, skill &amp; experience increases, they may be given a more complex task which will eventually make them skilled chefs. Many Ex-chefs begin their career as pot washers. Beginning in an entry-level position and working one’s way up has been the traditional way of advancing in a food service career. Today, however, who is a graduate from hotel management start at entry-level already possessing knowledge of food production practices, which would give them a head start over other beginners who have no knowledge.
<br>
<br><strong>B. ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR IN THE KITCHEN
</strong><br>
<br>A CUISINE means the kitchen. Also ‘Art of cooking’
<br>
<br><strong>C</strong>are of equipment
<br><strong>U</strong>nderstanding the basic method (to achieve quality)
<br><strong>I</strong>ntegrity in handling &amp; serving food 
<br><strong>S</strong>afety in handling equipment 
<br><strong>I</strong>nitiatives you will have to take
<br><strong>N</strong>eatness during work &amp; presentation. 
<br><strong>E</strong>fficiency of yourself.
<br>
<br><strong><em>“Be positive and think positive’’
</em></strong><br>
<br>The emphasis of a food service education is on learning a set of skills. But attitudes are more important because a good attitude will help you not only to learn skills but also to preserve and overcome many difficulties you will face in your career. The successful food service workers follow an unwritten code of behavior and set of attitudes, which may we call “professionalism”.
<br>
<br>Set of qualities are:-
<br>
<br><strong><em>1. positive attitude</em></strong> towards the job: in order to be a good professional chef you must like cooking and want to do it well. The satisfaction of doing your job well and making everything run smoothly will give you enjoyment, which you will always cherish. A chef with a positive attitude works quickly, efficiently, neatly, and safely. Professional chefs take pride in their work and want to make sure that the work is something to be proud of.
<br>
<br><strong><em>2. Staying power:</em></strong> A food service personnel requires good health, physical and mental stamina, and a willingness to work for longer hours.
<br>
<br><strong><em>3. Ability to work</em></strong> with people: works as a team &amp; it is essential to be able to work well as a team and to co-operate with your colleagues.
<br>
<br><strong><em>4. Communication:
</em></strong><br>● With your supervisors: let them know your difficulties.
<br>● With your colleagues: share knowledge and also learn from them. Nobody knows everything.
<br>● With your subordinates: respect them &amp; be courteous.
<br>● With the food &amp; beverage staff: control your temper.
<br>
<br><strong><em>5. Eagerness to learn:</em></strong> there is more to learn about cooking than you will learn in a lifetime. The food service industry is changing so rapidly that it is vital to be open to new ideas. No matter how good your techniques are, you might learn an even better way to do the same thing, which you must have been doing for a long time.
<br>
<br><strong><em>6. Must develop a full range of skills:</em></strong> A chef must not only be a good cook but is also important to develop and maintain other skills that are necessary for the profession. <br>● Must be able to understand and manage food cost and other financial matters
<br>● Manage and maintain proper inventories.
<br>● Deal with suppliers.
<br>● Understand personnel management.<br>
<br><strong><em>7. Experience: </em></strong>there is no substitute for years of experience. Practice more &amp; more to gain more experience.
<br><br><strong><em>8. Aiming for quality: </em></strong>whatever you do must have a distinctive sign of quality.
<br><br><strong><em>9. Creativity:</em></strong> the sky is a limit, as in “nouvelle cuisine’’.
<br><br><strong><em>10. Return to basics: </em></strong>experiments and innovation need a good understanding of basics first.
<br><br><strong><em>11. Care of equipment:</em></strong> equipment has been put at your disposal to help you. TAKE CARE OF IT. Treat it as your own, even if it does not belong to you, for others will also be using it.
<br><br><strong><em>12. Safety: </em></strong>kitchens can be dangerous places injuries can occur by cuts, burns, handling of machines and equipment, falling, etc. Think about yours as well as others’ safety first.&nbsp;<br></p>
