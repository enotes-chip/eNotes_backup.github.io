                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>LINEN EXCHANGE
</strong><br>Linen is provided for rooms and F&amp;B areas following one of these four procedures: 
<br>Fresh-for-soiled/one-for-one This is a simple method of linen exchange. Fresh linen is provided only if an equivalent soiled article is given back. The advantage of this method is that there need be no record format. Usually, uniforms are exchanged according to this method. Even though fresh-for-soiled or one-for-one is the simplest exchange, in the case of large numbers of linen, it will take more time on account of the counting of both fresh and soiled and the fetching of the requisite amount of fresh articles. 
<br>
<br><strong>Set amount</strong> In this system, a set amount of linen is provided on a daily basis. 
<br><strong>Topping up</strong> This is the bringing up of the stock to the optimum level at periodic inter­vals or whenever it falls short of the predetermined optimum. 
<br><strong>Requisition</strong> This method of linen exchange is mostly used for banquet linen, where the requirements may vary from day today. A requisition slip is filled in, on the basis of which linen is provided. 
<br>
<br><strong>Room Linen Exchange Procedure 
</strong><br>In a hotel with an OPL, soiled room linen may be received directly by the laundry or it may be sent via the linen room to the laundry. The floor supervisor counts up the soiled linen from the floor and enters the count into the room linen control form. This form is prepared in duplicate and sent along with the soiled linen to the linen room. If the soiled linen goes directly to the laundry. 
<br>The linen room/laundry supervisor again counts up the soiled linen and stamps 'Received' on the form. One copy of this form is returned to the floor, the second and the third copy are filed at the linen room and the laundry respectively. The linen room supervisor issues fresh linen on a one-for-one basis, filling out the linen exchange form) and signs il If the linen room is short of linen, the supervisor enters the balance amount and issues them with the next lot. The form is countersigned by the floor supervisor and maintained in the linen room. 
<br>
<br><strong>Restaurant Linen Exchange Procedure 
</strong><br>Article of restaurant linen is exchanged at stipulated timings. An F&amp;B employee brings the soiled linen into the linen room. The linen room staff check the soiled linen received for damages. All items are counted and verified with the count in the F&amp;B linen exchange form. The count is entered in the linen exchange register for F&amp;B. The fresh linen is issued and the details are also entered in the linen exchange register. 
<br>
<br><strong>PAR STOCK
</strong><br>This refers to the amount of each type of linen required to make up all the guest rooms of the hotel at a given time, and so is the minimum quantity of clean linen that must be on and at any time. The par-stock quantity of linen is also referred to as 'house set-up'. 
<br>A number of factors, outlined in this section, go into the setting up of the par stock for linen. 
<br>
<br><strong>The laundry cycle</strong> Does the hotel have its own laundry? If yes, the number of sets can be reduced as the linen is washed the same day. If a contract laundry handles the linen, the delivery period has to be taken into account and extra stocks kept on hand for the interim period. 
<br>
<br><strong>Occupancy level and usage</strong> How busy is the hotel? What are the peak periods? The summer season and humid climates necessitate more frequent changes of towels. Whether lowering the par would lead to overuse of each linen article, leading to rapid deteriora­tion and condemnation, is also to be taken into account. 
<br>
<br><strong>Replacement</strong> The general rule of thumb is to store one full par-stock quantity of new linen on an annual basis as a replacement for worn-out, damaged, lost, or stolen linen articles. 
<br>
<br><strong>Emergency</strong> A power failure or equipment damage may shut down the hotel's laundry operations and interrupt the movement of linen through the laundry cycle. One par stock of linen is kept on hand for such emergency situations. 
<br>
<br>Thus, a par number has to be set up to maintain the par stock of linen. The 'par number' is a multiple of the 'one par' or set-up quantity required to support daily housekeeping functions. Thus two pars of linen comprise the total number of each type of linen needed to outfit all guest rooms twice. In the same way, three pars of linen is the total number of each type of linen needed to outfit all guest rooms three times, and so on. In most deluxe hotels, the par number is kept at 4-5 times the set-up. For instance, in a 100-bed property with an OPL, there may be 500 pairs of sheets so that: 
<br>
<br><strong>• </strong>100 pairs, the first par, would be in circulation 'today'.
<br><strong>•</strong> 100 pairs, the second par, by way of 'yesterday’s linen, would be in the on­ premises laundry.
<br><strong>•</strong> 100 pairs, the third par, comprise the linen to be stripped from the guest room beds 'today' and meant for laundering 'tomorrow'.
<br><strong>•</strong> 100 pairs, the fourth par, being the emergency linen in the linen room.
<br><strong>• </strong>100 pairs, the fifth par, of replacement linen stored in the linen room.
<br>
<br>In hotels where the soiled linen is washed on the same day they have stripped away,3 ½ pars of linen may be maintained. Where contract laundries handle the linen, 6 pars of linen may have to be maintained. <br></p>
