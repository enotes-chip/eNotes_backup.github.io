</strong><br>Linen is the highest annual cost inventory in the housekeeping department, hence get­ting good value for the money spent should be an important priority for an executive housekeeper. Therefore, the housekeeper must have a thorough knowledge of the composition, construction, and properties of various types of fibers and fabrics. 
<br>
<br><strong>General Selection Criteria for Fabrics 
</strong><br>The fabrics chosen must not only retain their appearance throughout their useful life, but must also be serviceable, easy to maintain, and long-lasting. The general criteria for the selection of fabrics for bed linen, bath linen, soft furnishings, F&amp;B linen, and health-club linen are outlined here. 
<br><strong><br></strong><strong>Strength</strong> The strength of the fabric depends upon the type of fiber used. Synthetic fibers (such as polyester and acrylic) have more strength than natural ones (such as cotton and wool). The type of weave and the closeness of the weave also affect the fabric strength. The strength of the selvage too should be checked by tugging at it. 
<br>
<br><strong>Laundering</strong> Linen and laundering costs come right after labor costs on the list of highest expenditures. Synthetics require lower temperatures and shorter cycles while laundering than cotton. No-iron blends do not require pressing. 
<br>
<br><strong>Comfort</strong> This depends on the feel, texture, softness, and weight of the cloth. Any fabric that comes into contact with the skin must be absorbent. Cotton has very high absorbency compared to synthetics. 
<br>
<br><strong>Shrinkage</strong> Synthetics do not shrink, whereas natural fibers shrink by about 6-8 percent unless they have been sanforized. Wool loses its shape if not carefully laundered. 
<br>
<br><strong>Colour</strong> patterns, texture, and color, in fabrics, can impart character to a room. At the same time, one should not forget the need for ease of maintenance. Most hotels prefer white linen as it can be safely laundered without fear of its color fading. The colored fabric should be checked for dye stability. Fabrics dyed at the yarn stage (vat-dyed) are definitely more color-fast than ones dyed at the fabric stage. Dyed natural fibers will fade after several washes. Dark-colored fabrics show dust and lighter marks, whereas light­coloured ones show dirt and stain easily; these will be less apparent in a medium-toned fabric. The colors chosen must also be easily available when replacements are required. 
<br>
<br><strong>Pattern and texture</strong> A patterned fabric can hide marks. Abstract patterns will not hide marks as much as mottled patterns. Large patterns can make a large area look filled and vice versa. As for texture, a more open texture collects more dust and dirt. 
<br>
<br><strong>Flame-retardancy</strong> Wool is naturally flame-retardant. Synthetic fabrics-such as Tekla which are manufactured to be flame-retardant are also available, though not yet in India. Flame-retardant fabrics can be used for drapery, upholstery, and carpets. 
<br>
<br><strong>Thermal insulation</strong> The warmth of a fabric used for coverlets and such is determined by its thermal insulation properties, measured in units called 'togs'. This must be checked for blankets. Drapery should also help to maintain the temperature of a room to some extent. 
<br>

<br>
<br><strong>Linen Lifespan 
</strong><br>The lifespan of linen is measured in terms of how many times it can be laundered before becoming too worn to be suitable for guest room use. Durability, laundry considerations, and purchase price are the main criteria that an executive housekeeper has to bear in mind while selecting linen. The housekeeper needs to calculate the cost per-use in order to evaluate alternative linen purchases using the following formula: 
<br>
<br><strong>Cost per use</strong> = Purchase cost + Lifespan laundering costs / Number of lifespan launderings <br><br>where, 
<br><strong>Lifespan laundering cost</strong>= Item weight x Laundering cost per kg x Number of launderings withstood 
<br>
<br>The expected useful life of the linen is often more important than the purchase price in determining whether alternative products are economical or not. The cost of launder­ing linen over their useful life is usually much greater, and therefore more important than their initial price. 
<br>
<br><strong>DISCARDS AND THEIR REUSE 
</strong><br>Discarded or condemned linen are items that are no longer useful in their present condition due to some irreversible damage such as a permanent stain or simply wear and tear. 'Cutting down' refers to the using of any discarded materials for some other purpose, such as bedsheets being used as dust sheets or being made into pillow covers. Turning discards into rags is one of the simplest and most common ways of recycling. Large discarded sheets can be cut down for use as crib sheets, aprons, and other such articles. On some properties, discarded linen is sold to hotel staff at reasonable prices. Some properties also donate used linen to charities. Whatever the norm, all discards should be accounted for and properly recorded.
<br>
<br><strong>Linen Hire
</strong><br>Hiring linen is uncommon in India, but many hotels in other parts of the world do not purchase linen and prefer to hire laundered linen from a hiring company. Linen hire companies supply clean linen to hotels on a hire basis. Thus it is a contract with a company that rents and launders linen. The system has both advantages and disadvantages.
<br><strong><br></strong><strong>Advantages
</strong><br>» Initial purchase investment is eliminated.
<br>» No laundering of linen is necessary.
<br>» Less storage space.
<br>» Less staff which means fewer salaries to pay.
<br>» No need to order linen so the purchase function is eliminated.
<br>» No repairing of linen by the hotel.
<br>» It is ideal for spasmodic trade such as seasonal hotels, by avoiding capital expenditure and the need to store seldom-used linen.
<br>» Linen hire charges may be no greater than the combined depreciation and laundering costs.
<br> 
<br><strong>Disadvantages
</strong><br>» No individuality.
<br>» The choice is limited – the linen specifications, sizes, and standards may be different from those required by the hotel.
<br>» No cut-downs or makeovers are possible.
<br>» Damages have to be paid for, usually at a higher rate. u
<br>» The hotel is totally dependent on the hiring company.
<br>» There is no control over the quality of the wash.
<br>» Linen supply may be affected by bad weather or strikes causing a breakdown in operations.
<br>» If there is low occupancy, there is a loss due to unused linen.
<br>» The excess requirement is charged at the current rate.
<br>» Guest laundry will have to be dealt with or co-ordinated with a commercial laundry&nbsp;<br></p>
