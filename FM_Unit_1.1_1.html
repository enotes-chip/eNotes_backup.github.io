                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Electrical Terms
</strong><br>
<br>The four most basic physical quantities in electricity are:
<br> • Voltage (V)
<br> • Current (I)
<br> • Resistance (R)
<br> • Power (P)
<br>
<br>Each of these quantities are measured using different units:
<br>• Voltage is measured in volts (V)
<br>• Current is measured in amps (A)
<br>• Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω)
<br>• Power is measured in watts (W)
<br>
<br><strong>What is a volt?
</strong><br>A "volt" is a unit of electric potential, also known as electromotive force, and represents "the potential difference between two points of a conducting wire carrying a constant current. Voltage" (V) is the potential for energy to move and is analogous to water pressure.
<br>
<br><strong>What is a amp?
</strong><br>An "amp", short for ampere, is a unit of electrical current which is defines in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. "Amperage" is the strength of a current of electricity expressed in amperes.
<br>
<br><strong>What is an ohm?
</strong><br>"Ohm" is a unit of an electric circuit that is defined as the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.
<br>
<br><strong>What is a watt?
</strong><br>A "watt" is a measure of power. One watt (W) is the rate at which work is done when one ampere (A) of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt (V).
<br>
<br>Simple way to understand……
<br>Watts = Amps x Volts
<br>Volt = Watts / Amps
<br>Amps = Watts / Volts
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Fuses and Circuit Breakers
</strong><br>Fuses and Circuit Breakers both serve the same purpose – which is to protect electrical circuits by preventing overloads that can cause fires. They both interrupt the flow of electricity, but in very different ways from each other.
<br><br>Fuse is made of a piece of metal that melts when overheated.
<br>● Cartridge Fuse 
<br>● Plug Fuse
<br>
<br><strong>Fuses</strong>
<br>Fuses come in different types – for both residential and commercial use. The most common type is made from a metal wire or a filament that is enclosed in a glass or ceramic and metal casing. In residential homes, the fuse is usually plugged into a central fuse box, where the building’s wiring passes through. When electricity flows, the fuse will permit the power to pass unobstructed across the filament between circuits. If overloads occur, the filament melts and stops the flow of electricity.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Circuit Breakers 
</strong><br>Circuit breakers on the other hand, have internal switch mechanisms that can be tripped by an unsafe surge of electricity. 
<br>Circuit Breakers have two different ways of working – the first is through the use of an electromagnet and the other is through the use of a bi-metal strip. In both instances, when turned on, the breaker allows electrical current to pass from a bottom to an upper terminal across the strip. Once the current reaches any unsafe levels, the magnetic force of the strip becomes strong enough to throw a metal lever in the switch mechanism, breaking the current. The other option that can happen is that the metal strip can bend, throwing the switch and breaking the connection. 
<br>
<br><strong>Circuit breaker components
</strong><br>The five universal circuit breaker components are: 
<br>
<br>● Frame – Protects internal parts of the circuit breaker from outside materials 
<br>● Operating mechanism – Provides a means of opening and closing the circuit breaker 
<br>● Contacts – Allows the current to flow through the circuit breaker when closed. 
<br>● Arc extinguisher – Extinguishes an arc when the circuit breaker interrupts a fault. 
<br>● Trip unit – Opens the operating mechanism in the event of a prolonged overload or short circuit.
<br>
<br><strong>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage 
</strong><br>* Fuse is a less expensive device to protect from over current. It reacts quicker than the circuit breakers, and it as a hope that it won’t cause more failure than the breakers because of it as less moving parts. Whereas in circuit breakers if the inner working parts have some faulty, the damage to the electrical appliances will be more because they react slower than the fuse. 
<br>* One must be careful when replacing the fuse. If you install a 30amp fuse on a 20amp circuit, it ultimately leads to cause an electric fire. 
<br>* Keep on replacing melted fuses can become more expensive but, in circuit breakers, you need to flip the switch. 
<br>* Installation of a circuit breaker is complicated and expensive and also the maintenance cost is high but in a long-term, it saves a lot of money. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>The Difference Between Fuse and Circuit Breaker 
</strong><br>* Fuse works on the principle of electrical and thermal properties of the conducting materials whereas the Circuit breaker works on the Electromagnetism and switching principle. 
<br>* Fuses once used cannot be reused again, but the Circuit breaker can be reused. Hence, there is no need to change the circuit breaker after any fault takes place and the coil is tripped. 
<br>* Fuse cannot be used as an ON/OFF switch whereas Circuit Breaker can be used as an ON/OFF switch. 
<br>* Fuses are independent of ambient temperature, but Circuit Breaker not require any ambient temperature. 
<br>* The Fuse provides protection against only power overloads whereas Circuit Breaker provides protection for both power overloads and short circuits. 
<br>* Breaking capacity of the fuse is low as compared to that of a Circuit Breaker. 
<br>* Operating time of fuse is very less about 0.002 second, whereas Operating time of a Circuit Breaker is comparatively more than that of the fuse. It is about 0.02 – 0.05 second. 
<br>* Mode of operation of Fuse is completely automatic, but Circuit Breakers can be operated manually as well as automatically with the help of a relay system. 
<br>* The cost of the fuse is low, whereas Circuit Breakers are more costly. 
<br>
<br><strong>Voltage drop 
</strong><br>A voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when a current passes through the cable. It is related to the resistance or impedance to current flow with passive elements in the circuits including cables, contacts and connectors affecting the level of voltage drop. The longer the circuit or length of cable the greater the voltage loss. The impact of a voltage drop can cause problems such as motors running slowly, heaters not heating to full potential, lights being dimmed. To compensate for voltage drop larger cross-sectional sized cables may be used which offer less resistance / impedance to current flow. 
<br>
<br>V=IR 
<br>Ohms Law: V = I R 
<br>*Ohm’s Law (I = V/R) says: 
<br>* The current (I) through a wire or electrical resistor is 
<br>* proportional to the potential difference V across the two ends, and 
<br>* inversely proportional to its resistance R. 
<br>* Resistance (R) depends on Surface 
<br><strong><br>Single- phase &amp; three- phase electric power 
</strong><br>* single-phase electric power is the distribution of alternating current electric power using a system in which all the voltages of the supply vary in unison. Single-phase distribution is used when loads are mostly lighting and heating, with few large electric motors. A single-phase supply connected to an alternating current electric motor does not produce a rotating magnetic field; single-phase motors need additional circuits for starting (capacitor start motor), and such motors are uncommon above 10 kW in rating. 
<br>
<br>* Three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating current voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400 V across any two phases. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Three Phase Supply Benefits 
</strong><br>* Copper Utilization Reduction 
<br>* Lessening of Security Risks for Employees 
<br>* Labour Treatment Costs 
<br>* The efficiency of the Conductor is Greater 
<br>* Facility to Run High Power Loads 
<br>
<br><strong>Single Phase Supply Benefits 
</strong><br>* The benefits of choosing a single phase supply include the following. 
<br>* The design is less complex 
<br>* Design cost is less 
<br>* Most efficient AC power supply for up to 1000 watts 
<br>* Single Phase AC Power Supply is most competent for up to 1000 watts. 
<br>* Wide-range of application uses 
<br>
<br><strong>Key Differences between Single Phase and Three Phase Supplies 
</strong><br>* The definition of the single-phase power supply is, the power supplies through a single conductor 
<br>* The definition of the three-phase power supply is, the power flows through three conductors. 
<br>* The single-phase power supply has one distinct wave cycle whereas; three phase has three distinct wave cycles. 
<br>* Single phase requires the single wire to connect the circuit whereas; 3-phase needs 3-wires. 
<br>* The voltage of the single phase is 230V, whereas three phase voltage is 415V. 
<br>* The phase name of the single phase is split phase, whereas three phase has no other name. 
<br>* The capacity of power transfer in the single phase is minimum, whereas three phase has the maximum. 
<br>* The connection of single phase is simple whereas in 3-phase is complicated. 
<br>* The power failure happens in a single phase, but not occurs in three phase. 
<br>* The loss in single phase is maximum whereas in three phase is minimum. 
<br>* The single-phase efficiency is less whereas in three phase is high. 
<br>* The single-phase is inexpensive whereas the 3-phase is expensive. 
<br>* The single-phase AC power supply is utilized for home appliances and three phase power supply is used in huge industries to run heavy loads. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>AC &amp; DC System 
</strong><br>There are two systems of electric generation and supply, 
<br>1. Direct current or DC. 
<br>2. Alternating current or AC. 
<br>
<br>● Direct Current: it is the kind of electric current that may or may not change the magnitude but the direction of the current will never change. E.g. Cells, Batteries and DC Generator. 
<br>
<br>● Alternating Current: it is the kind of electric current, which not only changes its magnitude but also its sign as time passes, in a definite manner. This is the current that is supplied by Power station for domestic and commercial use. 
<br>
<br><strong>Kilowatt hour 
</strong><br>One kilowatt-hour is equal to the work done or energy consumed when a device of power 1 kW is used for 1 hour. The hour is a unit of time listed among the non-SI units accepted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for use with the SI. Its combination with the kilowatt, a standard SI unit, is therefore permitted within the standard.
<br>
<br><strong>Electricity sales 
</strong><br>Electrical energy is typically sold to consumers in kilowatt-hours. The cost of running an electrical device is calculated by multiplying the device's power consumption in kilowatts by the operating time in hours, and by the price per kilowatt-hour. The unit price of electricity charged by utility companies may depend on the customer's consumption profile over time. Prices vary considerably by locality. In the United States prices in different states can vary by a factor of three.
<br>
<br>While smaller customer loads are usually billed only for energy, transmission services, and the rated capacity, larger consumers also pay for peak power consumption, the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes. This compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power. These charges are billed as demand changes. Industrial users may also have extra charges according to the power factor of their load. 
<br>
<br>Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours (TWh) for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year. A 365-day year equals 8,760 hours, so over a period of one year, power of one gigawatt equates to 8.76 terawatt-hours of energy. Conversely, one terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of about 114 megawatts for a period of one year. 
<br>
<br><em>Examples 
</em><br>An electric heater consuming 1000 watts (1 kilowatt), and operating for one hour uses one kilowatt-hour of energy. A television consuming 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt-hour. A 40-watt electric appliance operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt-hour. In terms of human power, a healthy adult male manual laborer performs work equal to about one half of one kilowatt-hour over an eight-hour day.
<br>
<br><strong>Electrical Earthing 
</strong><br>The process of transferring the immediate discharge of the electrical energy directly to the earth by the help of the low resistance wire is known as the electrical earthing. The electrical earthing is done by connecting the non-current carrying part of the equipment or neutral of the supply system to the ground.
<br>Mostly, the galvanised iron is used for the earthing. The earthing provides the simple path to the leakage current. The short circuit current of the equipment passes to the earth which has zero potential. Thus, protects the system and equipment from damage.
<br>
<strong><em><br>Types of Electrical Earthing
</em></strong><br>● Neutral Earthing 
<br>● Equipment Earthing
<br>
<strong><br>Importance of Earthing 
</strong><br>The earthing is essential because of the following reasons 
<br>
<br>● The earthing protects the personnel from the shortcircuit current. 
<br>● The earthing provides the easiest path to the flow of shortcircuit current even after the failure of the insulation. 
<br>● The earthing protects the apparatus and personnel from the high voltage surges and lightning discharge.<br></p>
