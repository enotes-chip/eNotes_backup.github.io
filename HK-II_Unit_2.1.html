</strong><br>Space should be allotted in the linen area for a sewing room where linen, uniforms,  and guest clothing can be repaired and attended to. The first essential for successful sewing is a good work area. Ideally, it should be a small room set apart for the purpose or in smaller hotels, a well-lit corner kept solely for sewing.
<br>
<br><strong>Activities in the Sewing Room
</strong><br><strong>• </strong>Designing, stitching, altering and mending uniforms, Hemming, stitching of hooks, buttons, repairs to torn pockets, replacements of zips, etc. are carried out.
<br><strong>•</strong> Stitching and patching of table linen and various F&amp;B linen-like serviettes, jupone, napperons, etc.
<br><strong>•</strong> Making ‘make-overs’ or ‘cutting down’ from condemned linen into still-usable forms for guest areas or staff areas. Make-overs are rarely used in guest areas. A discarded or condemned bed sheet can be made over into a pillowcase or a discarded table cloth can be cut down to a perfectly usable serviette.
<br><strong>•</strong> Making crib-size sheets, blankets and pillowcases.
<br><strong>•</strong> Sewing soft furnishings such as draperies and bedspreads if fabric is available.
<br><strong>•</strong> Repairing curtains, bedspreads, etc. whatever is an expensive item and requires a minimum of repair to put it in order or be of use.
<br><strong>•</strong> Mending of linen and uniforms Frayed parts and tears frequently occur in towels, table and bed linen. These are repaired by machine darning. Patching, repairing flaps of pillowcases and torn pockets are common sewing tasks. Ideally mending should be carried out before laundering, but dealing with soiled or wet articles is unpleasant, so mending is usually done on laundered articles.
<br><strong>• </strong>Straightforward ordinary machining is done for hems on sheets and towels, and table linen. New items which require straight stitching like bedsheets and tablecloths may be made.
<br><strong>•</strong> Repairing guests’ clothing can be done on request and charges may or may not be levied as per hotel policy.
<br><strong>• </strong>Machine marking and monogramming may be carried out. For marking linen, it is usual to mark on the right side of the article, on the wrong side, the name of the hotel and the department and the date it was put into circulation. The latter shows the wearing quality of the article and helps to estimate the lifespan of the article.
<br><strong>•</strong> Stitching of upholstery
<br><strong>•</strong> Making recommendations for the quantity of material required for upholstery, curtains, and so on
<br><strong>•</strong> Converting condemned linen into reusable form
<br> 
<br><strong><br></strong><strong>JOB SPECIFICATION OF A SEAMSTRESS/TAILOR
</strong><br>To perform skilled tasks in the making and repairing of such articles as draperies, curtains, slipcovers, lampshades, and towels. 
<br> 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>Must be proficient in the use of the following: sewing machine, electric iron, button-holing machine, sewing needles and thimble, scissors, and measuring tape. 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>Promotion possible to posts of Head seamstress, linen room attendant, and linen room supervisor. 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>The duties of this job may be divided between a seamstress of draperies and curtains and a seamstress of fine linen (such as napkins and tablecloths). 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>The duties of this job may be included with those of linen room maid or linen room supervisor. 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>Hazards: Possible injury to hands from sewing machine needles. 
<br><strong>‣ </strong>Not only are there eye guards and finger guards on the machines, but also proper grounding of electrical connections is ensured.
<br>
<br><strong><br></strong><strong>SEWING AREA AND EQUIPMENT
</strong><br>The basic sewing room equipment includes a work table, an ironing board, and sewing machines. Heat-patching machines for the neat repair of holes in linen are also useful. An over-edging machine is used for remaking discards such as towels into waste cloths. It cuts. seams. and overcasts in one operation. 
<br><br>Good lighting in the sewing room is essential. Storage space should be provided for fabrics patterns and smaller equipment. A pegboard screen is useful for hanging tool clothes and storage bags. The work surface should be large enough-at least 2 x I sq metre-for cutting and pinning, and also firm enough to bear the load of the sew­ing machine. Small items such as thread, zippers, and trimmings should be stored in a basket, workbox, or shallow drawer. Repairs should be made with 100-percent polyester threads, which give strength and do not shrink. <br>
<br>Good quality tools make sewing easier and less time-consuming and the results more professional. All the machines should be dusted and oiled regularly by the operators. 
<br>A regular servicing schedule should also be made with the company providing the machines. 
<br>
<br><strong>Cutting tools 
</strong><br>Fabric shears or scissors should be used only for cutting fabrics, as using them on paper will blunt them. An appropriate size is 10-12 inches. Use small scissors with sharp, pointed ends for buttonholes, embroidery, and cutting the ends of cotton thread. A seam ripper, which has a tiny protected blade, cuts stitching without harming the fabric. Pinking shears give a zigzag, fray-resistant finish to raw edges. 
<br>
<br><strong>Measuring tools</strong> 
<br>Choose a fibreglass tape measure - this material does not stretch. It should be marked with metric as well as imperial measurements. A metre stick or metre rule is essential for working on soft furnishings. It is also useful for marking long lines on patterns or checking hem levels. A set square is needed when cutting curtains or upholstery to ensure true right angles at the corners. Perspex rulers and set squares allow one to see the grain of the fabric. 
<br>
<br><strong>Pins and pincushions 
</strong><br>Use fine, sharp pins, preferably 18 mm long. Shorter pins can be used for lightweight fabrics and paper. Glass-headed pins can be used for sheer or lacy fabrics. Longer, 30-mm pins are needed when cutting out loose covers. A pincushion held on the wrist on a band of elastic keeps pins and needles handy while working. It can also be hung on the sewing machine.
<br>
<br><strong>Needles and thimble 
</strong><br>Needles are graded by number, ranging from No. 1 (longest and thickest) to No. 24 (smallest and finest). Keep a darning needle and darning mushroom in the work basket. Keep needles threaded in a dry place, such as a felt-paged needle-book, to protect them. 
<br>
<br>Thimbles are protective covers worn on the thumb and second finger when sewing. Steel thimbles are the best. They should fit the fingers snugly. 
<br>
<br><strong>Clips and weights</strong> 
<br>When cutting a long piece of fabric, fix it to the edge of the table with clips. Weights are also useful for preventing the material from slipping or twisting off-grain. 
<br>
<br><strong>Pattern paper 
</strong><br>The special pattern paper is available, marked with squares to make pattern drawing easy. But large sheets of lining paper or brown paper can also be used for soft-furnishing patterns. Tissue-paper patterns that are being used a lot should be transferred to heavier paper. 
<br>
<br><strong>Marking equipment 
</strong><br>Tailor's chalk is used for marking alterations. Test fabrics first to make sure that the chalk will not permanently mark them. Coloured carbon paper can be used with a tracing wheel to transfer pattern markings onto the fabric. For delicate fabrics, use a smooth-edged wheel. For everything else, use a spiked wheel. 
<br>
<br><strong>Sewing machine 
</strong><br>The machines should be able to handle various thicknesses of fabric and blind-stitch so that the stitching does not show on the other side. Computerized machines are more expensive but they are easy to operate, very accurate, and do double duty. Zig-zagging machines or attachments can be used for mending, darning, and sewing buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
