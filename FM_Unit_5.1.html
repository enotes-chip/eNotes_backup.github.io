                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>VENTILATION<br><br>Introduction</strong><br>It is well known that if a closed space is occupied by human beings and/or contains organic matter as in a kitchen or store room, the air inside, if not properly circulated and replaced by fresh outside air, soon becomes hot, humid, and stale. Staying inside will become very uncomfortable and the organic matter would also deteriorate in quality under such conditions. The purpose of ventilation is to provide controlled air to such spaces to prevent unpleasant conditions of internal air. Proper ventilation can provide a very comfortable interior environment to such spaces. Ventilation is, thus, necessary for public areas, guest rooms, banquet halls, kitchen, and other stores. However, it is to be borne in mind that a substantial amount of energy is expended to move a large volume of air through various units in the ventilation route for the purpose.
<br>
<br>Ventilation is, thus, about helping air to circulate inside rooms and public areas in the hotel. It allows moisture and airborne pollutants to escape, and fresh, clean air to be drawn into the desired space. Well-designed ventilation provides cooling in summer. In winter, it lets stale air out to keep warmth in. There could be two basic mechanisms for ventilation, namely 
<br>(a) natural circulation (also called passive ventilation) as air flows naturally through doors and windows and 
<br>(b) mechanical ventilation using fans to drive air in and fans to extract air out in the ventilation system of a given space.
<br>
<br><strong>CONDITIONS OF COMFORT AND VENTILATION SYSTEM
</strong><br>The feeling of comfort for persons inhabiting a space depends largely on the following factors.
<br>
<br>● Amount of oxygen available for easy breathing
<br>● Speed and distribution of air passing around them
<br>● Quantity of dirt, smoke, and odour in the room
<br>●Humidity or amount of moisture in the air
<br>●Temperature
<br><br>The purpose and design of a good ventilation system are to provide optimal conditions of comfort. Not all spaces in an establishment require the same degree of control for all the factors of comfort. For example, a kitchen may not have close control on temperature, odour, and smoke, while a banquet hall may have very close control of almost all the factors of comfort. Ventilation, thus, has
to perform the following functions for complete control of the factors of comfort:
<br><br>1. Supply of fresh air to
<br>(a) Replenish oxygen in the space
<br>(b) Remove smoke and odour
<br>(c) Carry away the heat given off by human body, organic matter, and heat appliances in a kitchen
<br>2. Proper distribution of air at different spaces inside an establishment through sound design of ducting
<br>3. Control of temperature by air cooling/heating arrangement
<br>4. Control of humidity as a part of air-conditioning system
<br>5. Control of dirt by using filters in the air intake system
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF VENTILATION
</strong><br><strong>1. </strong>Natural Ventilation
<br>● Cross Ventilation
<br><strong>2. </strong>Mechanical Ventilation (Artificial)
<br>● Balanced Ventilation
<br>● Supply Ventilation
<br>● Exhaust Ventilation
<br>● Plenum Ventilation
<br>
<br><strong>Natural Ventilation
</strong><br>Ventilation provided in the building for the entry of fresh air through the door, windows ventilators. It’s called natural ventilation . It’s natural ventilation whatever the external conditions are their same things will be maintained inside the building also. The advantage of natural ventilation is free and no additional devices are required to treat the air.
<br>
<br><strong>Cross Ventilation
</strong><br>In this method of natural ventilation the openings such as windows or ventilators are provided in the adjacent walls or opposite walls so that fresh air can enter from one side of the opening and the used air can go out from the other end.
<br>
<br><strong>The balanced system</strong> 
<br>It uses a fan to supply air to the interior and another one to remove air from the interior. In many ventilation systems, a lot of energy is saved by a design where a part of the return air from various rooms (already cold/hot and relatively free from dirt albeit a little less fresh) is mixed with fresh air intake.
<br>
<br><strong>The supply-only system 
</strong><br>It uses one or more fans called ‘forced draught’ fans to supply air to the building interior, relying on exfiltration outflow through doors, crevices, etc. to remove air from the building. The air inlet is generally at a high level with louvers that are adjusted to prevent downward draught of cold air.
<br>
<br><strong>The exhaust-only system 
</strong><br>It uses one or more fans called ‘induced draught’ fans to draw air out of the building interior, relying on infiltration or inflow through doors, crevices, etc. to provide the make-up air supply required.
<br>
<br><strong>Plenum Ventilation
</strong><br>A system of mechanical ventilation in which fresh air is forced into the spaces to be ventilated from a chamber (plenum chamber ) at a pressure slightly higher than atmospheric pressure, so as to expel foul air. This ventilation is used in cinema halls, multiplex, banquet halls to provide the fresh air supply.
<br>There are two types of Plenum Ventilation
<br>● Upward Plenum
<br>● Downward Plenum
<br>
<br><strong>Upward Plenum
</strong><br>In upward plenum fresh air is forced into the building through the ducks which are fitted at the lower level of buildings and the utilised air is removed through the outlets which are fitted below the ceilings wall. In this process the air force pattern is upward and hence the name upward plenum process.
<br>
<br><strong>Downward Plenum
</strong><br>In this type of ventilation air is forced into the building through the ducks which are fitted at the higher level (below ceiling level) and utilized air is removed through the ducks which are fitted at the lower level of the building.
<br>In this process the air force pattern is downward and hence the name downward plenum process.
<br><br><strong>VENTILATION AIR QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS
</strong><br>Depending on the exact nature of space to be ventilated, building codes and ventilation engineering handbooks provide the standards for requirements of fresh air in the space. Fresh air requirement to replenish is only 20 percent of the air needed to remove body odour. So, the amount of fresh air needed is usually based on the requirement to remove odour and the heat generated inside the room. Kitchen requirement usually would not be guided by the requirement of providing an
<br>odour-free environment.
<br>
<br>1. Room-volume basis
<br>2. Floor-area basis
<br>3. Occupant-based method, and
<br>4. Equipment-based method
<br>
<br><strong>Room-volume Basis
</strong><br>As the name suggests, room-volume basis specifies air requirements for 1 cu m of room volume. Codes usually specify the requirements in terms of number of air changes per hour. One air change is equal to the introduction of fresh air of volume equal to the volume of the room. Thus, if the size of the room is 5 m x 6 m X 3 m (volume being 90 cu m) and if the code specifies that the particular room needs 20 air changes per hour, it would mean that 20 x 90 cu m of air has to be introduced into the room every hour. Some codes specify this requirement not on the basis of gross volume of room space but on the free air space available therein. The number of air changes per hour required for the room depends upon the type of activity being carried on in the room. 
<br>
<br><strong>Floor-area Ventilation Method
</strong><br>The second common procedure involves calculation of fresh air requirements on the basis of gross floor area. A common figure could be 3 cu m of fresh air per hour per square meter of floor area.
<br>
<br><strong>Occupant-based Method
</strong><br>In this method, the fresh air requirement is specified on the basis of volume of fresh air needed per hour per person. The volume of fresh air needed per person per hour depends on the air space available for each person. Clearly, if free air space available is more per person, the fresh air needed is less. This requirement further depends upon whether or not smoking is permitted in the space. For example, a space where 3 cu m of air space is available per person, the fresh air requirement is 60 cu m per hour per person for non-smoking zone (82 cu m for smoking zone), whereas a space where each person has 12 cu m of air space available inside the room, the fresh air requirement drops to 22 cu m per hour per person for non-smoking zone (30 cu m for smoking zone). The minimum requirement as specified in different building codes range from 18 cu m per hour per person to 21.5 cu m per hour per person.
<br><br><strong>Equipment-based Method
</strong><br>In spaces such as kitchen, stores, machine room, boiler, engine room, and laundries, factors such as the number, size, power consumption, safety requirements, heat potential of the equipment as also the moisture given off by the equipment could be the appropriate basis of calculation of fresh air requirement. The requirement could be specified either per unit of equipment or per net sq m occupied by the equipment. This figure would again vary depending on the type of equipment based on the factors as mentioned.
<br>
<br><strong>SCHEMES OF VENTILATION SYSTEM
</strong><br>There are many schemes of operations and related installation layout for ventilation systems. They can be classified as follows:
<br>
<br>1. Central ventilation system with complete central control
<br>2. Central ventilation system with separate heating/cooling control for each room/space
<br>3. Separate ventilation system for each room
<br>4. Zonal ventilation system
<br>
<br><strong>Central Ventilation System with Complete Central Control
</strong><br>A central ventilation system includes all sorts of air condition controls such as heating, cooling, humidity control, and dust control. However, a particular estate may not decide to install all the conditioning elements in its ventilation system. This arrangement economizes on the power requirement as the return air is relatively cleaner and cooler/hotter, as the case may be, than fresh
air and to put it in simple words, it is to a large extent already conditioned except for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide and odour.
<br>The important features of central ventilation systems are as follows:
<br>● There is continuous air (cold/hot, etc.) movement through all the rooms whether or not the rooms are occupied. Even if only one room is occupied, the entire system must be operated to provide ventilation to that room.
<br>● Only one set of equipment for each function (for example, one fan, one cooler/one heater, one dehumidifier/one humidifier, one air filter, etc.) is required for the purpose.
<br>
<br>An analysis of these features indicates that though the capital cost of a central ventilation system may be less, its running cost tends to be high, and it lacks selective control of conditions for different spaces.
<br>
<br><strong>Central Ventilation System with Separate Heating/Cooling Control for each Room/Space
</strong><br>This system introduces control on selective cooling/heating of rooms while retaining
the essential features of a central ventilation system. Although whenever a room is not occupied, the particular heating/cooling unit can be put off, it still circulates fresh air inside unoccupied rooms causing energy and money wastage.
<br>
<br><strong>Separate Ventilation System for each Room
</strong><br>This system is opposite to the concept of central ventilation system and provides for local fans and other components for ventilation for each room/space. The major advantage is that each room/space can be closely controlled for ventilation requirements. However, the total cost of components is liable to go up as also the cost of carrying large inventory goes up.
<br>
<br><strong>Zonal Ventilation System</strong>
<br>This is a compromise between local and central systems of ventilation. Separate independent ventilations units are provided for all the rooms/spaces in a particular zone. A zone could be a floor, or a wing, or a building depending on the size, importance of the rooms/space, and level of control desired. If there are some guest rooms still available in zone I while rooms in zone II are all vacant (and hence ventilation systems there not put on operation), a new guest should be encouraged to take room in zone I instead of zone II to economize on costly energy.
<br>
<br>
<strong><br>Factors Affecting Ventilation System Design and Performance 
</strong><br>Various factors that affect the design. selection and performance are the following:
<br><br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Type of space being served</em></strong> A kitchen should be ventilated by an extraction fan to prevent spread of odour to other rooms. while in public rooms, storehouses. should be ventilated by inlet fans forcing fresh air free of any odour.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Number of probable occupants</em></strong> Bedrooms can have less air changes per hour than a kitchen or a boiler house.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Amount of dust and pollutants in free air</em> </strong>This affects the efficiency of cleaning of the filter units in a ventilation system.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Type of gas being ventilated out</em></strong> Exhaust outlets from areas that may be contaminated by noxious dust, fumes, steam, gases, odour or other contaminants harmful to people should be placed above the roof level. The discharge to the atmosphere should be located as far as possible, usually not less than 8 m from any operable window, door, and/or outdoor intake for a fan.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Types of space to be ventilated on a particular floor</em></strong> If a particular floor has all different types of requirements for different space, a locally controlled system is advisable, while if the floor contains space that can be grouped together according to the ventilation needs, such as a number of guest rooms on a particular floor, it can be served by a dedicated ventilation system with common control.
