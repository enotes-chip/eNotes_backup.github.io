                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Successful companies are organized, and many businesses use hierarchical management for their structure. This structure – which makes clear that all employees are under the leadership of another person or department.
<br>Hierarchical management is a workplace leadership structure in which authority is assigned in ranks and employees take directions from their superiors. 
<br>
<br><strong>HIERARCHY AND KITCHEN STAFFING
</strong><br>Hierarchy refers to the flow of authority from top to bottom in an organization and with respect to the kitchen. It refers to the flow of authority commencing from executive chef and goes to the bottom i.e. kitchen staffing refers to not only assigning the positions but also filling them with the suitable manpower. Staffing is the actual strength of the employees working at different levels, which depends upon the various factors as:
<br>
<br>• The extent of the menu and the market a kitchen is serving.
<br>• Use of prepared convenience foods.
<br>• Types of equipment available.
<br>• Need of skill involved at the various levels
<br>• The size of the establishment
<br>
<br><strong><em>Kitchen organisation: The organisation of the hotel and restaurant kitchen depends upon the:
</em></strong><br>• Size of the operation
<br>• Type of the menu
<br>• Type of the service
<br>• Type of clientele.
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSICAL BRIGADE</strong>
<br>Chef Auguste Escoffier gave the concept of classical brigade, which means the actual work force requirement of any particular establishment. He divided whole of the kitchen into parties/ corners
and the system is followed in the organizations. Purpose of the classical brigade is to fix the duties and responsibilities and fix the area of work by party/ corner. We mean grill party, roast party, vegetarian party etc. It was the time when few machines were available so more need was there to know about the manpower requirements.
Following are the key points related to the classical brigade in a professional kitchen:-<br><br>* A professional kitchen operates with a very distinct rank just like army of soldiers , probably this is why Escoffier called it a brigade.
<br>* Each member of the kitchen has his/her role to play for the success of a team.
<br>* It was based on the various sections of the kitchen (for ex. Pastry, butchery, bakery etc.)
<br>* Every section was named in French.
<br>*Every section featured a head of department, with cooks, helpers and porters working under him/her<br></p>
