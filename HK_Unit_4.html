                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Housekeeping is a department in the hotel industry that maintains cleanliness, hygiene &amp; perfect ambiance in each and every sector except the kitchen. Housekeeping is also one of the backbone of the hotel industry. The hotel business depends on the guest. A frequent guest knows the difference between a good and mediocre hotel. To him, a hotel is both a home and an office which will be visited many times in a year. In a competitive situation, the guest will choose a hotel in which he feels welcomed. The guests want just more than wine and dine. Housekeeping is the department that is perhaps responsible to bring back the guest to the hotel again and again. This is so because the guest wants personal recognition and the housekeeping department has ample scope to pay attention so to all guests, thus making them feels important.
<br>
<br>Moreover, this is the department that is indirectly responsible for earning the maximum revenue for the hotel. The rooms sold by the front office are the rooms made by the housekeeping. We must remember that rooms are the most perishable commodity in a hotel.
<br>
<br><strong>Importance of Housekeeping
</strong><br>• Hotel’s largest margin of profit comes from the sale of rooms because a room once made can be sold over and over again. Housekeeping helps in the sale of rooms (FO can sell the room only when the HK cleans &amp; makes them ready for sale). A good hotel operation ensures optimal sales to get maximum profit.
<br>• Room sale is also dependent on the quality of decor, room facilities, cleanliness, and safety of room which is ensured by the housekeeping department.
<br>• It creates a “home away from home” experience
<br>• Maintains guest satisfaction by providing a clean, comfortable &amp; safe environment
<br>• Contributes towards the reputation of the hotel
<br>• Helps in getting repeat business. Unless the room décor is appropriate, the air odour free plus cleanliness all over, the hotel may lose the guest as a potential repeat customer.
<br>• Satisfied guests also spread the word of mouth about the property which helps in getting more business.
<br>• Makes sure that the other departments work also goes on smoothly
<br>• The tasks performed by a housekeeping department are critical to the smooth operation of any hotel and it is a 24 X 7 X 365 operation.
<br>
<br><strong>Role of Housekeeping
</strong><br>1. First Impression: Housekeeping helps us to give a good impression to any customer because when a customer first comes into a hotel, he/she will feel good to see the good system regarding decoration &amp; make his/her visit again and again.
<br>2. Home Away From Home: Housekeeping provides a home away from home because when any customer takes a room &amp; sees that everything that a room requires is placed on its right place &amp; all the facilities like home are there in the room so he/she will feel that he/she is not away from home.
<br>3. Repeat Business: When a customer will be satisfied with the services provided by the hotel &amp; also likes the decoration or view of the hotel, he/she will visit the same hotel again&amp; again. Also, he/she will tell others to be the customer of that hotel so we can say that housekeeping plays the role of repeat business.
<br>
<br><strong>Benefits of Housekeeping
</strong><br>The benefits to be given from adopting planned housekeeping and or maintenance subsystem can be considered in financial, aesthetic, and human terms.
<br><br>• Aesthetic Benefit: Any area looks more attractive if it is maintained clean and if things are placed in the right place and this is achieved by good housekeeping practices. Cleaning is not only essential to retain the appearance of surfaces and total areas, both inside and outside the building but also helps in improving appearance e.g. Floor seals. Appearance and apparent cleanliness do have a psychological effect on the building user – who may value judgment of total experience based on his perception of an initial view of appearance and standards of cleanliness.
<br>
<br>• Financial Benefit: Financial benefit refers to good earnings of the hotel when the customer or guests will come again &amp; again so the hotel will get more revenue or earnings that will give financial benefits to the hotel. Over a period of time, it proves more cost-effective to provide cleaning and maintenance services on a regular planned schedule basis. This helps in extending the life span of equipment surfaces, furniture, fittings, and furnishings. Thus deferring the heavy expenditure of frequent replacement or renovation.
<br>
<br>• Human Benefit: These benefits are divided into two ways:
<br><br>1. Guest Benefit: Clean, attractive, well-maintained surroundings are more pleasant, enjoyable, and comfortable for clients to use, increase customer satisfaction, affect repeat business. Housekeeping provides a good facility to the guest so that he feels good &amp; gives them a proper place to stay out of the home without any feeling that we are away from home.
<br><br>2. Employee Benefit: Employees get a good atmosphere for doing their work or job which is made possible if the hotel has good housekeeping practices. If employees get a good working atmosphere it increases their morale, they work hard &amp; efficient works lead to an increase in the revenue. This in turn not only affects labour turnover and recruitment, but it also contributes to creating hygiene and safety hazards.
