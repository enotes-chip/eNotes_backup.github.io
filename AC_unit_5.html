</strong><br>Fats and oils are nutritionally useful and, in some form, economical sources of energy and give a satiety value to the dish. They also contribute characteristic palatability, qualities of flavour and texture. They are popularly used as the medium of cooking. Fats are solid at ordinary temperature and melt when heated. Oils are liquids at ordinary temperature. Only coconut oil solidifies at low temperature.
<br>
<br>The scientific term /lipid comprises a group of substances that include natural fats and oils. Both these lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol. The only difference between fats and oils is that oils are liquid at room temperature whereas fats are solid as they contain saturated fatty acids. The exception to this rule is coconut oil and palm oil, which are solid at room temperature. The saturation is increased artificially by adding hydrogen into fat by a process known as saturation or hydrogenation of oil. The oil is converted into margarine by passing hydrogen into the oil to make it saturated. This is done to stabilize the fats and oils and therefore, the shelf life of the product increases as it does not oxidise easily. 
<br>
<br>Fats and oils do not dissolve in water; but they can be emulsified with liquids to produce salad dressings and sauces. Fats along with carbohydrates and proteins make up the major components of food. Fats and oils are extracted from animals, seeds like nuts, and spices. Animal fats such as suet. and lard come naturally from animals such as beef and pork, respectively, and products like butter are churned mostly out of cow's milk. The choice of oil or fat used for cooking, gives an instant recognition to the origin of the dish. The dishes made in olive oil immediately tell us that they are from Mediterranean region and sesame oil is mostly used in Asian dishes. Even in India, mustard oil is more prevalent in the east, coconut oil in the south, and ghee and butter are commonly used in the north.
<br>
<br>Every fat or oil has its own breakdown point where at a certain temperature, if the fat is held for a
longer duration, the fats breakdown into fatty acids and glycerol. Upon further heating, this glycerol
gets further converted into a compound known as acerolin, which is difficult to digest by the body and produces cancer-causing cells. So while selecting fats and oils for cooking, choose depending upon the usage. For deep-frying choose a fat with high smoke point, and for salads and dressings use nutritious and high quality oils such as olive oil and nut-based oils. 
<br>
<br>Another term that we should be aware of is the flashpoint of oil or fats. This is the point, where the fat or oil has been heated so much that it catches fire. Lipids should never be heated beyond smoke point, as it breaks down the fat and can also cause accidents.
<br>
<br>Various fats used in cooking are lard (pig’s fat), suet (fat around kidneys), dripping (tallow beef fat), butter, margarine, ghee, hydrogenated fat, cocoa butter (for confectionery).
<br>
<br>Oils are extracted from coconut, palm, sesame, cotton seed, olive, peanut, mustard, corn and sunflower. Salad oil is a deodorised vegetable oil and is used for salad dressings, etc., as olive oil-the best for the purpose is very expensive and scarce.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Fats and oils are used for various purposes; the major culinary part played by them are as
</em></strong><br><strong>(1)</strong> spreads
<br><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;shortenings
<br><strong>(3)</strong> tempering
<br><strong>(4)</strong> salad dressings
<br><strong>(5)</strong> frying medium
<br>
<br><strong>Spreads:</strong> Butter and margarines are used for spreads, and their function is to add to the flavour, nutritional value and satiety value of breads.
<br>
<br><strong>Shortening:</strong> These are fats which shorten the gluten strands, surround them and make them more easily broken (short). When added to bread, it gives a bit of tenderness, richness and a sheen to the crumb.
<br>
<br><strong>Tempering:</strong> Dals, curries, rice dishes, etc., are tempered. The fat or oil is heated to which cumin seeds or mustard, or fenugreek seeds, etc.. are added and poured over the dals.
<br>
<br><strong>Salad Dressings:</strong> Fat is used for the various salad dressings hot animal fat dressings, which consist of bacon fat, vinegar and seasonings, served hot, are used on green hot salads. Cooked dressing is a cooked mixture of egg, vinegar, fat, starch and seasonings. French dressings are emulsions of oil, vinegar or lemon juice and seasoning. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, acid, egg yolk and seasoning.
<br>
<br><strong>Frying Medium:</strong> Fats and oils are used as a medium of cooking. i.e. pan roasting, frying. and sauteing. When fats or oils are heated, a temperature is reached at which visible fumes appear, which is defined as smoke point. Fats with high smoke points are suitable for frying. Different fats do not have the same smoke point. The highest frying needed for any food is about 199°C (390°C). Hydrogenated fats have a high smoke point and are good as a frying medium compared to other fats.
<br>
<br><strong>Selection of a good Fat
</strong><br>For the selection of a good fat, the following points should be remembered. A frying fat should have a high smoke point, low congealing point, high stability, low moisture content, and should have an acceptable flavour.
<br>
<br>Fats and oils have a high percentage of unsaturated fats and have more shortening power than saturated fats. Animal fats such as butter, lard and suet make the food short, i.e. break off (short) and readily melt in the mouth. For the selection of shortening, the following factors should be observed:
<br>
<br><strong>(1)</strong> Shortening should cream well or it wilt affect the cake volume.
<br><strong>(2)</strong> It should have no moisture; then it will be short. Shortness is correlated to baking biscuits, cookies, pastries, wafers, mathies, nankhatais, nimkies, etc.
<br><strong>(3) </strong>The shortening should be stable and should not get rancid so that the cooked product has a good keeping quality.
<br><strong>(4)</strong> The right consistency of fat, ie. solidified for puff and flaky pastry, soft for cakes and biscuits, helps to get a good texture. To acquire good results in baking, because of fats and other ingredients, certain rules should be followed— “The richer the pastry, the hotter the oven, and the richer the cake, the cooler the oven.”
<br>
<br><strong>Role of fats and oils in cooking and baking
</strong><br>Fats and oils are the prime ingredients in any dish around the world. In all the methods of cooking, oil plays a very important role, especially in cooking methods such as frying. Fats and oils give richness, variety of textures. and smoothness to the foods that otherwise may be dry to eat. The melting points of oils and fats are very important for chefs, as this property will decide the usage of the particular lipid in a dish. One cannot deep-fry in butter as it will burn to black, when it reaches the temperature of frying.
<br>
<br>Fats and oils are used in cake-making to moisten the batter and to improve the keeping qualities of a cake. The fats have the ability to retain a certain amount of air during the preparation stage. During the cooking process, the fat melts and produces steam which in turn aerates and lightens the product. Flavoured oils are key ingredients in salad dressings. Peanut oil, for instance, is agreeably light in a dressing. whereas olive oil is unmistakably rich and distinctive. All-purpose oils such as corn and sunflower oil have no strong favour to impart, but even small quantities of nut oils such as walnut oil or infused oils such as chilli oil add a distinctive flavour to the dish. 
<br>
<br>Fats and oils can be categorized into following categories namely<strong><em> Animal fats and Vegetable fats</em></strong>. Fats are often treated to obtain products for cooking. for example. the two most common terms in cooking will be:
<br>
<br><strong>Rendering the fat</strong> Rendering is a process where the fat is melted on low heat to separate the skin
and non-fatty membrane. All the fat will melt out leaving some crisp skin behind, which is known as
<em>Crackling</em> and this can be then used in salads and garnishes.
<br>
<br><strong>Clarified butter</strong> Clarifying butter is a process where the water and the milk solids are removed so that the butter becomes more stable and can be used for cooking without changing its properties. To prepare clarified butter, slowly melt the butter so that the water evaporates and the milk solids settle to the bottom of the pan. The clarified butter is then either spooned out or carefully poured
out leaving the milk solids behind. Because the milk solids are removed, clarified butter has a higher
smoking point, meaning that you can heat up the butter to a higher temperature without burning or
smoking.
<br>
<br><em>Apart from frying, the fats and oils are used for various purposes in the kitchen. let us discuss the
usage of these below:
</em><br><br>•&nbsp;<strong>Flavoured fats</strong> Butter is flavoured with various condiments and served as table butter, or as an accompaniment to as a dish, or even used as a spread on sandwiches and burgers. Olive oil is also flavoured and served as a table accompaniment.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Dressings Oils</strong> and fats are primary ingredients for making salad dressings, where an oil and acidic medium such as lime juice, vinegar, or any other acidic medium is emulsified in the presence of binders such as mustard and egg.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Baking</strong> Fats and oils weaken the protein and this ability of fats is used effectively in making a variety of baked dishes. The fats and oils weaken the gluten present in the flour and give various textures such as softening of the bread dough or shortening of the pie dough. 
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Medium of cooking</strong> Fats and oils are used in almost all methods of cooking except boiling, poaching and steaming. Fats are used to sauté, grill, deep-fry, shallow fry, etc.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Tempering </strong> Extensively used in Indian cooking, fats and oils are used to crackle spices and then poured on top of the dish for added Flavour and taste. In India, we call it by different names such as Tadka, Baghaar, or Chonk.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Laminating</strong> Fats such as butter and margarine are used to create layers in dough to make puff pastry and other laminated dough such as croissant and Danish.
<br><br><strong><em><br></em></strong><br><strong><em>Animal Fats used in cooking
</em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><br>•&nbsp;<strong>Lard</strong> This is the fat from the pork and is commonly used in cooking and baking. Though with more awareness of health, the use of lards and other natural animal fats is restricted to special dishes only.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Suet</strong> Fat from beef is called suet. Due to its stability, it is used to be a very common ingredient for short crust Pies, etc, but butter has majorly replaced all the natural saturated animal fats due to health reasons.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Margarine</strong> This is an emulsion of water and oil. It is mainly vegetable oil but at times, it may contain a mixture of both animal and vegetable oils. These oils are then saturated by addition of hydrogen, which makes it more stable and increases its melting point. Margarine is used mainly in pastry work and is hardly used in cooking.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Butter</strong> Dairy butter consists of about 80% fat and 20% water and whey. It is the milk protein in the whey that makes butter spoil quickly and, together with milk sugar (lactose), causes it to scorch when overheated. In the West, most butter is made from cow's milk, but elsewhere butter made from the milk of a water buffalo, yak, goats, and sheep is also available.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Ghee</strong> Ghee is the primary cooking fat in India, and in many Arab countries where it is called Samna. It is a type of clarified butter, which is simmered until the moisture evaporates and the butter caramelizes, producing a strong, sweet flavour. It is made from buffalo's as well as cow's milk and can be bought in jars or can be made at home.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong><em>Types of Vegetable oils used in cooking
</em></strong><br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Corn oil</strong> Made from corn or maize and this oil has a smoke point of 230°C and hence, most suitable for deep-frying.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Cotton seed oil</strong> Cottonseed oil is commonly used in cooking and it also has a very high smoke point as corn oil.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Sunflower oil</strong> Most of the vegetable oils are made from the seeds and sunflower is no exception. All the vegetable oils can be unrefined or refined, The refined process increases Its smoke point, thereby making it more suitable for frying, it has a smoke point of 232°C.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Groundnut oil </strong>This is also known as the peanut oil, aid is suitable for deep-frying as it has a high smoke point. People who are allergic to peanuts will not be affected by the peanut oil-as the proteins have the allergen and not the fats. It has a smoke point of 225° C.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Palm oil </strong>Most widely produced oil in the world, It is made from the seeds of the fruit of the palm. It has  a reddish hue because of the presence of beta carotenes, which fade away when the oil is heated. It is very stable oil and hence commonly used to make margarine. This oil is semi-solid at room temperature.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Rapeseed oil</strong> Rapeseeds are used for animal feeds. It is the healthiest oil used for cooking and the literal translation of Can-O- LA is Canadian oil low in acid content. .
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Mustard oil</strong> Mustard oil is made from mustard seeds and is very commonly used in India. This oil is deep yellow in colour and has a very strong flavour. Mustard oil should be allowed to smoke for at least two to three minutes to allow the pungent flavours to escape. This oil is commonly used to pickle vegetables.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Olive oil</strong> Made from olive, it is commonly used in all the Medicerranean countries. This oil has a low smoke point of 165° C and hence not very suitable for deep-frying.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Nut-based oils</strong> Made from various nuts and seeds of the nuts. Many oils such as walnut oil, and hazelnut oil are very strong and few drops are added to salads or soups and are never used for cooking. They are very expensive and rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Nut oils on application of heat may turn bitter and they have a very low smoke point.
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;<strong>Vegetable oil </strong>Some vegetable/fruit oils such as avocado, pumpkin, rapeseed are commonly used to make oils that are mostly used to make margarine. Avocado oil is very expensive and used to flavour salads and dressings.&nbsp;<br></p>
