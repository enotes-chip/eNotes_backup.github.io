                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The hospitality industry is among the oldest commercial activities in the world. It is, in fact, an integral part of the larger business enterprise known as travel and tourism, which provides a wide range of travel-related services, such as modes of travel, accommodation, food and drinks, recreational activities, and other facilities required by the modern-age traveler. Hospitality seems to be a glamorous industry, but not many know that a tremendous amount of hard work goes behind the sheen and glitter that meets the eye. This chapter is aimed at providing an insight into the evolution and growth of the hospitality industry in India and other parts of the world. Tourism is one of the most important commercial activities of the modern economy. The relationship between the tourism and hotel industries is also explained with reference to the diverse profile of the present-day client, who could be traveling for business, vacation, pleasure, adventure, or even medical treatment. An overview of hotels and their core departments is also provided for an overall understanding of hotel operations.
<br>
<br><strong>THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY</strong>
<br>Catering to all needs of travel-related activity, the hospitality sector is estimated to be a US $3.5 trillion industry in the world economy today (2011). Hospitality refers to the relationship between a guest and a host, and it also refers to the act or practice of being hospitable. It includes cordial reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Hospitality is also known as the act of generously providing care and kindness to whoever is in need.
<br>
<br><strong>Origin and Growth
</strong><br>The origin and development of the hospitality industry are a direct outcome of travel and tourism. There are many reasons for which a person may travel: business, pleasure, further studies, medical treatment, pilgrimage, or any other reason. When a person travels for a few or more days, he may carry his clothes with him, but it’s not possible for him to carry his food and home. Thus, two of his three basic needs-food and shelter are not taken care of when he is traveling. This is where the hospitality industry steps in. 
<br>
<br>Before the wheel was invented, people undertook journeys on animals such as horses, camels, and elephants. In those days, they used to travel in groups called caravans for safety. However, there was a limit to the distance they could cover in a day. At nightfall, they avoided travel due to the fear of wild animals and bandits, and also because of animal fatigue. Thus, for the night halt, they looked for places that could provide them with water, fuel to cook food, and, above all, security from wild animals and bandits.
<br>
<br>The primitive lodging houses or inns originated essentially to cater to these needs of the travelers. Throughout the world, they were known by different names, such as <em>Dharamshala</em> and <em>Sarai</em> in India,<em> ryokans</em> in Japan, <em>paradors</em> in Spain, <em>pousadas</em> in Portugal, <em>coffee houses</em> in America, <em>taverns</em> and <em>inns</em> in Europe, <em>cabarets</em> and <em>hostelries</em> in France, <em>mansionis</em> and <em>hospitia</em> in Switzerland, <em>phatnal </em>in Greece, and relay houses in China.
<br>
<br>The earliest inns were generally run by families or husband-wife teams who provided large halls to travelers to make their own beds and sleep on the floor. They also provided modest wholesome food and drinks like wine, port, ale, etc., and stable facilities for the animals. Entertainment and recreation were also provided on a modest scale. All this, of course, came for a price. These inns or lodging properties were housed in the private homes of the local people. They made a living by providing accommodation to travelers. These inns were not as clean and tidy as we see them today. They were also devoid of the frills and facilities as seen in the modern-day hospitality establishments. The travelers had to make their own beds and cook for themselves. Gradually, the inns started providing beds to travelers—typically, an inn would have a large hall with many beds 
<br>
<br><strong>TOURISM INDUSTRY
</strong><br>Tourism is one of the world’s fastest-growing industries and a major source of foreign exchange and employment generation for many countries. It is regarded as one of the most remarkable economic and social phenomena of the past century. According to the data available with the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), a global forum for promoting tourism, the number of international arrivals in the world grew from 25 million in 1950 to a whopping 806 million in 2005-nearly 30 fold rise-registering an annual average growth rate of 6.5 percent. 
<br>The word 'tour is' derived from the Latin word <em>tornus</em>, meaning 'a tool for making a circle'. Tourism may be defined as the movement of people from their normal place of residence to another place (with the intention to return) for a minimum period of twenty-four hours to a maximum of six months for the sole purpose of leisure and pleasure. 
<br>
<br>The Rome Conference on tourism in 1963 defined tourism as 'a visit to a country other than one's own or where one usually resides and works. This definition, however, did not take into account domestic tourism, which has become an important money-spinner and job generator for the hospitality industry. 
<br>The UNWTO defines tourists as 'people who travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Tourism can be categorized as international and domestic tourism
</em></strong><br>
<br><strong>International tourism</strong> When people visit a foreign country, it is referred to as international tourism. In order to travel to a foreign country, one needs a valid passport, visa, health documents, foreign exchange, etc. International tourists may be inbound or outbound
<br>
<br><strong><em>Inbound:</em></strong> This refers to tourists of outside origin entering a particular country. 
<br><strong><em>Outbound:</em></strong> This refers to tourists traveling from the country of their origin to another country. 
<br>
<br><strong>Domestic tourism</strong> The tourism activity of people within their own country is known as domestic tourism. Traveling within the same country is easier because it does not require formal travel documents and tedious formalities like compulsory health checks and foreign exchange. In domestic tourism, a traveler generally does not face many language problems or currency exchange issues. 
<br>
<br><strong>Importance of Tourism 
</strong><br>Tourism and hospitality, which are inextricably linked to each other, are among the major revenue-earning enterprises in the world. They happen to be among the top employers too. There has been an upmarket trend in tourism over the last few decades as travel has become quite common. People travel for business, vacation, pleasure, adventure, or even medical treatment. The present-day tourist, who has higher levels of disposable income, international exposure, and refined tastes, wants specialized versions of products and services, such as quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or commercial hotels. This has led to a demand for better quality products and services, mainly regarding accommodation and traveling, thus feeding the growth of the hospitality industry as a whole. 
<br>
<br>The developments in technology and transport infrastructures, such as jumbo jets, low-cost
airlines and more accessible airports have made tourism affordable and convenient. There have also been changes in lifestyle - for example, now retiree age people sustain tourism round the year. The sales of tourism products on the Internet, besides the aggressive marketing of tour operators and travel agencies, have also contributed to the growth of tourism. 
<br>
<br>With several business-related activities associated with tourism, the industry has a tremendous potential of generating employment as well as earning foreign exchange. There are many countries in the world, such as Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji, and the Caribbean, whose economies are primarily driven by tourism. Tourism can contribute to the economic growth of a country in the following ways: 
<br>
<br><strong>Employment generation</strong> It creates a large number of jobs among direct service providers (such as hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, tour operators, guide and tour escorts, etc.) and among indirect service providers (such as suppliers to hotels and restaurants, supplementary accommodation, etc.). 
<br>
<br><strong>Infrastructure development</strong> Tourism spurs infrastructure development. In order to become an important commercial or pleasure destination, any location would require all the necessary infrastructure, like good connectivity via rail, road, and air transport, adequate accommodation, restaurants, a well-developed telecommunication network, and medical facilities, among others. 
<br>
<br><strong>Foreign exchange</strong> The people who travel to other countries spend a large amount of money on accommodation, transportation, sightseeing, shopping, etc. Thus, an inbound tourist is an important source of foreign exchange for any country. 
<br>
<br><strong>INDUSTRIES RELATED TO TOURISM 
</strong><br>Over the years, tourism has become a popular global activity. Depending upon the nature and purpose of their travel, tourists need and demand certain facilities and services. This has given rise to a wide range of commercial activities that have acquired industry proportions. Thus, travel and tourism nowadays represent a broad range of related industries. 
<br>
<br><strong>Hotels</strong> Hotels are commercial establishments that provide accommodation, meals, and other guest services. In general, to be called a hotel, an establishment must have a minimum of six guest rooms, at least three of which must have attached private bathroom facilities.  Although hotels are classified into 'star' categories, there is no standard method of assigning these ratings, and compliance with customary requirements is voluntary. An American hotel with a certain rating, for example, may look very different from a European or Asian hotel with the same rating and would provide a different level of amenities, range of facilities, and quality of service. Although hotel chains assure uniform standards throughout, non-chain hotels (even within the same country) may not agree on the same standards. 
<br>
<br>In the travel and tourism industry, the hotel industry plays a very significant role, as all tourists need a place to stay at their destinations, and require many more services and facilities to suit their specific needs and tastes. 
<br>
<br><strong>Restaurants</strong> Restaurants are retail establishments that serve prepared food and beverages to customers. Though the term is generally applicable for eating on-premises, it has also been used to include takeaway establishments and food delivery services. Restaurants range from unpretentious dining places with simple food served in simple settings at low prices to expensive establishments serving refined food and wines in a formal setting. Typically, customers are seated at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter who serves food when it is ready, and the customers pay the bill before leaving. In finer restaurants, there is generally a host or hostess to welcome customers and to seat them. Other staff waiting on customers include busboys and sommeliers. Restaurants often specialize in certain types of food, or present a certain unifying, and often entertaining, theme. For example, there are seafood restaurants, vegetarian restaurants, or ethnic restaurants. 
<br>In the travel and tourism industry, restaurants and other food and beverage outlets are very important as tourists like to experiment with the local cuisines of the places they are visiting. 
<br>
<br><strong>Retail and Shopping</strong> The retail industry is very important as tourists shop for their day-to-day necessities as well as look for mementos and souvenirs. In recent years, several cities in the world have been promoted as shopping destinations to attract people with a penchant for shopping by offering various products, such as garments, electronic goods, jewelry, and antiques, among others, at very low prices. Cities like Singapore, Dubai, and Bangkok attract shoppers with their state-of-the­-art malls and plush shopping plazas, while Cities like New York, Paris, London, and Milan in Italy are famous as fashion havens of the world. The recent years have seen the organization of events like shopping festivals to attract tourists with deep pockets. 
<br>
<br><strong>Transportation</strong> It is the movement of people and goods from one place to another. The term is derived from the Latin words trans meaning 'across' and <em>portare</em> meaning 'to carry. Industries that are in the business of providing transport equipment and service are important in most national economies and are referred to as transport industries.
<br>
<br><strong>Travel Agencies</strong> A travel agency is a retailing business that sells travel-related products and services, particularly package tours, to customers on behalf of suppliers such as airlines, car rentals, cruise liners, hotels, railways, and sightseeing and tour operators. In addition to dealing with ordinary tourists, most travel agencies have a separate department devoted to making travel arrangements for business travelers. However, some travel agencies specialize in commercial and business travel only. There are also travel agencies that serve as general sales agents for foreign travel companies, allowing them to have offices in countries other than their countries of origin. 
<br>
<br>A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. But, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a stock in hand. They do not buy a package holiday or a ticket from a supplier unless a customer requests it. Most travel agencies operate on a commission basis, implying that the supplier-airlines, car rentals, cruise liners, hotels, railways, or sightseeing and tour operators-offers a fixed percentage of the sale to the agencies as commission for booking clients. The agencies may offer a discount on a holiday package or ticket to the customers by shrinking their commission. Some travel agencies, especially large chains, undertake other commercial operations, such as the sale of in-house insurance, travel guide books, timetables, car rentals, and the services of an on-site bureau de change, dealing in the most popular currencies. 
<br>Travel agencies play a very important role as they plan out the itinerary of their clients and make the necessary arrangements for their travel, stay, and sightseeing, besides facilitating their passport, visa, etc. 
<br>
<br><strong>Tour Operators</strong> A tour operator assembles the various elements of a tour. It typically combines tour and travel components to create a holiday. The most common example of a tour operator's product would be a seat on a charter airline plus a transfer from the airport to a hotel, and the services of a local representative, all for one price. Niche tour operators may specialize in destinations and activities, or a combination thereof.
<br>The original raison d'etre (reason for existence) of tour operators was the difficulty of making arrangements in far-flung places, with problems of language, currency, and communication. Although the Internet has made self-packaging of holidays easier now, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have the time to do so. They specialize in large group events and meetings, such as conferences or seminars. Also, tour operators still exercise contracting power with suppliers (airlines, hotels, other land arrangements, cruises, etc.) and influence over other entities (tourism boards and other government authorities) in order to create packages and special departures for destinations that are otherwise difficult and expensive to visit. 
<br>
<br><strong>Tourist Destinations</strong> A tourist attraction is a place of interest for tourists, typically for its inherent or exhibited cultural value, historical significance, natural or built beauty, or amusement opportunities. Some examples include historical places, monuments, zoos, aquarium, museums, art galleries, botanical gardens, buildings, and structures, which include castles, libraries, former prisons, skyscrapers, bridges, landmarks, national parks and forests, theme parks and carnivals, ethnic enclave communities, historical trains, and cultural events. Tourist attractions are also created by capitalizing on unexplained phenomena such as a supposed UFO crash site near Roswell, New Mexico, and the alleged Loch Ness monster sightings in Scotland. Ghost sightings also make popular tourist attractions. Ethnic communities, such as China towns or the Jew community in Kochi (Kerala), are also popular among tourists. 
<br>Free promotional brochures and flyers of popular destinations are handed out in information centers, fast food restaurants, hotel and motel rooms or lobbies, and rest areas frequented by travelers. While some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or even free, others can be of low quality and may overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food, and souvenirs) in order to profit from tourists excessively. Such places are commonly referred to as tourist traps. 
<br>
<br><strong>Cultural Industries</strong> Cultural or creative industries are responsible for the creation, production, and distribution of goods and services that are cultural in nature and usually protected by intellectual property rights. These include literary works, visual and performing arts, crafts, and other creative fields. Cultural industries are knowledge-based and labor-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation, societies develop cultural heritage and enhance economic performance. As tourists like to visit places of cultural significance and soak in the culture of the area, the cultural industry is very important to travel and tourism.
<br>
<br><strong>Leisure, Recreation, and Sports</strong> Leisure or free time is a period of time spent out of work and essential domestic activity. Recreation or fun is spending time in a manner designed for therapeutic refreshment of one's body or mind. While leisure is more like a form of entertainment or rest, recreation requires active participation in a refreshing and diverting manner. As people in the world's wealthier regions lead increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the need for recreation has increased. The rise of so-called active vacations exemplifies this. 
<br>
<br>The spread of mass media has led to a growing public interest in sports. This has turned popular sports into good business opportunities, where rules of the game are sometimes bent to make them more profitable and popular. The emergence of the Twenty20 format in cricket is a case in point. Good marketing strategies and the promise of wholesome entertainment are attracting larger audiences, making sporting events popular among fans that are willing to travel to the games venues to get a first-hand experience of their favorite game. Thus, it is a little wonder that cities and countries across the world bid years in advance for hosting international sports events like the Olympics. 
<br>
<br>Thus, we have seen that tourism today encompasses a wide range of products and services-travel, accommodation, catering, and recreation, among others-for its clients. We have also briefly read how the hospitality industry emerged from the man's need to travel and has evolved into its present state today. The hotel industry is arguably the most significant part of the hospitality industry. In the succeeding sections, we will trace the origin and growth of this industry in the world, as also in India.&nbsp;<br></p>
