</strong><br>The term hotel was used for the first time by the fifth Duke of Devonshire to name a lodging property in London sometime in AD 1760. The word hotel is derived from the French hotel, which refers to a French version of a townhouse. Historically in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and several other countries, a townhouse was the residence of a peer or an aristocrat in the capital or major cities. The word hotel could have also derived from a hostel, which means a place to stay for travelers. 
<br>A hotel or an inn is defined by British Law as a 'place where a bonafide traveler can receive food and shelter, provided he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to be received. Hence, a hotel must provide food (and beverage) and lodging to a traveler on payment, but the hotel has the right to refuse if the traveler is not presentable (either drunk, or disorderly, or unkempt) or is not in a position to pay for the services. Alternatively, a hotel may be defined as 'an establishment whose primary business is to provide lodging facilities to a genuine traveler along with food, beverage, and sometimes recreational facilities too on a chargeable basis. Though there are other establishments such as hospitals, college hostels, prisons, and sanatoriums, which offer accommodation, they do not qualify as hotels since they do not cater to the specific needs of a traveler. 
<br><br>A hotel is thus an establishment that provides paid accommodation, generally for a short duration of stay. Hotels often provide a number of additional guest services, such as restaurants, bars, swimming pools, healthcare, retail shops; business facilities like conference halls, banquet halls, board rooms; and space for private parties like birthdays, marriages, kitty parties, etc. Most of the modem hotels nowadays provide the basic facilities in a room-a bed, a cupboard, a small table, weather control (air conditioner or heater), and bathroom-along with other features like a telephone with STD/ISD facility, a television set with cable channel, and broadband Internet connectivity. There might also be a mini-bar containing snacks and drinks (the consumption of the same is added to the guest's bill), and tea and the coffee-making unit having an electric kettle, cups, spoons, and sachets containing instant coffee, tea bags, sugar, and creamer. 
<br>
<br><strong>Core Areas of a Hotel: An Overview
</strong><br>The organization of a hotel today is very complex and comprises various departments. The number of departments varies from one establishment to another. All departments may have their own managers, reporting to the general manager and the assistant general manager.
<br>Typically present in a large hotel. Hotel departments fall under the category of either revenue-earning departments or support departments. 
<br>
<br><strong>Revenue-earning departments</strong> are operational departments that sell services or products to guests, thus, directly generating revenue for the hotel. These departments include the front office, food and beverage, and hotel-operated shops. 
<br>
<br><strong>Support departments</strong> are the ones that help to generate revenue indirectly by playing a supporting role to the hotel's revenue-earning departments. These include human resources, maintenance, purchase, housekeeping, and so on. 
<br>
<strong><br>Rooms Division Department</strong> In a large hotel, the housekeeping, front office, and maintenance departments come under the rooms division. These departments together are responsible for maintaining and selling the rooms in a hotel. In most hotels, these are the departments that directly or indirectly generate more revenue than any other department. This is because the sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50 percent of the total revenue of a hotel. A hotel's largest margin of profit comes from room sales because a room, once made, can be sold over and over again. The rooms division is headed by the rooms division manager to whom the front office manager, executive housekeeper, and very often the chief engineer report. 
<br>
<br><strong>Housekeeping department</strong> The housekeeping department is responsible for the cleanliness and upkeep of the front of house areas as well as the back of the house areas so that they appear as fresh and aesthetically appealing as on the first day when the hotel property opened for business. This department is headed by the executive housekeeper or, in chain hotels, the director of housekeeping.
<br>
<br><strong>Front office department</strong> Headed by the front office manager, the front office department is the operational department that is responsible for welcoming and registering guests, allotting rooms, and helping guests check out. Uniformed services like concierge and bell desk and EPBAX operators are part of the front office department.
<br>
<br><strong>Maintenance Department</strong> The maintenance department also called the engineering and maintenance department, is headed by the chief engineer or the chief maintenance officer. The department is responsible for all kinds of maintenance e, repair, and engineering work on equipment, machines, fixtures, and fittings.
<br>
<br><strong>Food and Beverage Department</strong> The food and beverage (F&amp;B) department includes restaurants, bars, coffee shops, banquets, room service, kitchen, and bakery. This department is headed by the F&amp;B director. While the restaurants, bars, coffee shops, banquets, and room service may be grouped specifically under the F&amp;B service department, headed by the F&amp;B manager, the kitchen and bakery fall under the F&amp;B production department, headed by the executive chef.
<br>
<br><strong>Human Resource Department</strong> The human resource (HR) department or the personnel department, as it used to be called earlier-is headed by the human resource manager. Recruitment, orientation, training, employee welfare and compensation, labor laws, and safety norms for the hotel come under the purview of the HR department. The training department is an ancillary department of the HR department. This is headed by the training manager, who takes on the specific task of orientation and training of new employees as well as existing ones. 
<br>
<br><strong>Sales and Marketing Department</strong> The sales and marketing department is headed by the sales and marketing manager. A large hotel may have three or more employees in this department, whereas a small hotel can do with just one employee. The function of this department is five-fold-sales, personal relations, advertising, getting MICE (meeting, incentive, conference, and exhibition) business, and market research. All these functions lead to the common goal of selling the product of the hotel-i.e. rooms-and the services of the hotel by 'creating' customers. 
<br>
<br><strong>Purchase Department</strong> The purchase department is led by the purchase manager, who, in some properties, may report to the financial controller. The procurement of all departmental inventories is the responsibility of the purchasing department. In most hotels, the central stores are part of the purchasing department. 
<br>
<br><strong>Financial Control Department</strong> Also called the controls department, the financial control department is headed by the financial controller, who is responsible for ratifying all the inventory items of the operational departments. Inventory control procedures are the responsibility of this department. The financial controller, along with the general manager, is responsible for finalizing the budgets prepared by the heads of other departments. The hotel's accounts are also maintained by the controls department. Accounting activities include making payments against invoices, billing, collecting payments, generating statements, handling bank transactions, processing employee payroll data, and preparing the hotel's financial statements. 
<br>
<br><strong>Security Department</strong> Headed by the chief security officer, the security department is responsible for safeguarding the assets, guests, and employees of the hotel. Their functions include conducting fire drills, monitoring surveillance equipment, and patrolling the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
