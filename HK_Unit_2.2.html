</strong><br>
<br>A cleaning agent removes or assists in removing or removes physically or chemically any soil from the surface. Dust being composed of loose particles, is removed comparatively easily by the use of various piece of equipment; dirt, however, owing to it’s adherence to surfaces by means of grease or moisture requires the use of cleaning agents as well as equipment if it is to be removed efficiently; and a knowledge of different types is important so that deterioration of surfaces is prevented.
<br>
<br><strong>Choice of cleaning agent</strong>
<br>With a variety of cleaning agents in the market, the housekeeper should remember that a great deal of time, effort and money can be wasted by wrong choice as well as possible deterioration of articles and surfaces. Cleaning agents are chemicals and the housekeeper should have some knowledge of cleaning science if they are to be chosen and used correctly. The following points maybe taken into consideration when choosing cleaning agents; -
<br>● Type of soiling
<br>● Composition
<br>● Ease of use
<br>● Saving of time and labour
<br>● Possible damage to surface
<br>● Toxic or irritation to skin
<br>● Smell
<br>● Versatility
<br>● Packaging
<br>● Storage and deterioration
<br>● Cost
<br><em>From the great variety of cleaning agents available, most commonly ones used are: -
</em><br>● Detergent
<br>● Scouring liquid / powder
<br>● WC cleanser
<br>● Mirror cleanser
<br>● Furniture polish
<br>● Air freshener
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF CLEANING AGENTS
</strong><br>Cleaning agents are classified according to the principle method by which soil or stains are removed from the surface. This will be determined by their composition. The principle classes are:
<br>● Water
<br>● Detergents
<br>● Abrasives
<br>● Degreasers
<br>● Acid cleaners
<br>● Organic solvents
<br>● Other cleaning agents
<br>
<br><strong>1. WATER:
</strong><br>Water is the simplest cleaning agent and some form of dirt will be dissolved by it; but normally it is a poor cleaning agent if used alone. It becomes effective only if used in conjunction with some other agent, e.g. a detergent. Water serves to:
<br>● Carry the cleaning materials to the soil
<br>● Suspend the soil
<br>● Remove the suspended soil from the cleaning site
<br>● Rinse the detergent solution from the surface
<br>● Water has poor power of detergency because:
<br>● It has high surface tension and forms droplets
<br>● It has little wetting power
<br>● It is repelled by oil and grease
<br>● If shaken within oil the emulsion does not prevent formation of large droplets
<br>● It has low surfactant effect (surface active agent)
<br><strong>Hardness: </strong>Hard water contains calcium and magnesium salts which will inhibit cleaning of material in the following ways –
<br>a. In combination with soap the salts form insoluble scum which reduces the efficiency of the soap and makes rinsing difficult
<br>b. Calcium combines with fat in the soil to form a soapy substance which adheres strongly to the surface
<br>c. The calcium and magnesium salts tend to cause flocculation (tendency to cause soil that is suspended in water, to redeposit on the surface being cleaned)
<br>d. Hardness of water also causes premature aging of fabrics, causes scale and fur to be deposited in machines and pipes.
<br><strong><em>Hard water can be softened by –
</em></strong><br>● Addition of soda
<br>● Addition of water softener based on Sodium sesquicarbonate
<br>● Water softening units, e.g. permutit.
<br>
<br><strong>2. DETERGENT:
</strong><br>Detergents are those cleaning agents, which contain significant quantities of a group of chemicals known as ‘Surfactants’ (chemicals which have water and soil attracting properties). A number of other chemicals are frequently included to produce detergents suitable for a specific use.
<br>A good detergent should –
<br>● Reduce the surface tension of water so that the cleaning solution can penetrate the soil
<br>● Emulsify soil and lift it from the surface
<br>● Be soluble in cold water
<br>● Be effective in hard water and a wide range of temperature.
<br>● Be hard on a surface that has to be cleaned. Clean quickly and with little agitation.
<br>● Suspend soil in a cleaning solution, and once the soil is removed, to hold it in suspension and not let it redeposit.
<br>● Rinse easily and leave no streaks or scum
<br>● Be economical to user
<br>● Be harmless to the skin and article.
<br>● Be biodegradable
<br>
<br><strong>Chemical composition of detergent: -</strong>
<br><strong><em>1. Surfactants</em></strong> are chemicals, whose molecules when dissolved in water possess, water seeking end (hydrophilic) and a water-repelling end (hydrophobic). They may or may not carry the positive and negative electrical charge. The molecules disperse through water and reduce the surface tension of water by overcoming the forces of attraction between the water molecules, thus allowing the water and surfactant molecules to penetrate the soil and surface.
<br><strong><em>2. Builders</em></strong> are alkaline chemicals that influence the effectiveness of a cleaning agent in one or both of the following ways -
<br>a. They sequester (combine with) calcium ions in hard water to form water-soluble salts, thus preventing the adverse effects of calcium.
<br>b. They enhance the emulsifying by increasing the pH value of the solution and dispersing properties of the detergent
<br>Builders in general can cause damaging effects on many surfaces, e.g. chrome, aluminum, wool, silk, paint, wood, linoleum. It may constitute up to 30% of heavily built powdered detergents and helps in softening water too.
<br><strong><em>3. Foaming agents</em></strong> increase or stabilize the foam formed by a detergent. Foaming can be used to surfactant activity, the level of foam depending on the amount of surfactant active in a cleaning solution, e.g. ethanol amides. Alkaloids derived from coconut oil are frequently used for this purpose. The foam will stick to all non-horizontal surfaces, increasing the contact between the surface and the cleaning chemical.
<br><strong><em>4. Chelating agents</em></strong> are relatively complex chemicals, which are included in many liquid detergents to sequester calcium ions. They are also frequently used as a desealer, being a more acceptable alternative to strong acids.
<br><strong><em>5. Suspending agents</em></strong> increase the amount of soil that can be held in suspension in the cleaning solution, e.g. sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.
<br><strong><em>7. Bleaches</em></strong> will break down with oxidation, those stains that have not been removed from the surface by surfactants or builders. Sodium perborate, oxidizing weak bleach is frequently included in detergents intended for washing textiles.
<br><strong><em>8. Bulking agents</em></strong> contribute to the volume of detergent powders, e.g. sodium sulphate.
<br>Conditioning agents ensure that the granules in the detergent powder are crisp, firm and dry.
<br>Whiteners cause absolute ultraviolet light to transmit as visible white light.
<br><strong><em>9. Enzymes</em></strong> are complex proteins that break down organic substances, e.g. blood stains, food stains, etc. they are effective at 30 to 50 degrees C and are inactivated at temperatures above 60 degrees C.
<br><strong><em>10. Anti Corrosive agents</em></strong> inhibit the formation of water films on the surface. Chemical reactions resulting in corrosion are generally dependent on the presence of water, e.g. sodium silicate.
<br><strong><em>11. Perfumes</em> </strong>and dyes are included to increase consumer acceptability, but increase the risk of allergic reactions.
<br><strong><em>12. Germicides</em></strong> are also added sometimes to prevent growth of bacteria and fungus.
<br>
<br><strong>3. ABRASIVES
</strong><br>The cleaning action of abrasives depends on the presence of fine particles which when rubbed over a soiled hard surface, dislodges the soil, removes tarnishing and surface scratches from meat surfaces. Abrasives can be divided into –
<br>● Hard surface cleaners
<br>● Metal polishes.
<br>Abrasives depend on their rubbing or scratching action to clean dirt from hard surfaces. The extent to which they will rub or scratch a surface depends on the nature of the abrasive material and on the size and shape of the particles. The use of abrasive will depend on the surface to be cleaned and the type of dirt to be removed. Whenever possible fine abrasives should be preferred to coarser ones. E.g. glass, sand, emery paper, steel wool, nylon pads, powdered pumice, feldspar, calcite, fine ash, precipitated whiting, filtered chalk, jeweler’s rouge (fine abrasive), etc. they are available in natural, liquid, paste or powdered form.
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF ABRASIVES
</strong><br>Based on the scale of hardness for various substances abrasives are classified as;
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
<br>Talc, Calcite, Feldspar and Diamond
<br>
<br><strong><em>Fine Abrasives:
</em></strong><br>These include precipitated whiting (filtered chalk) and jeweler’s rouge (a pink oxide of iron) used for shining silver. They are also constituents of commercial silver polishes.
<br><strong><em>Medium abrasives:</em></strong> these include rottenstone, salt, scouring powder and scouring paste. Scouring powders are made up of fine particles of pumice mixed with soap/ detergent, and alkali and a little bleach.
<br><strong><em>Hard / coarse abrasives:</em></strong> these include bath bricks, sandpaper, pumice, steel wool, and emery paper.Glass paper, calcite, sandpaper, fine ash, emery powder and paper, jeweler’s rouge, powdered pumice, precipitated whiting (filtered chalk). Ground limestone, sand, steel wool and nylon scourers are some commonly used abrasives.
<br>Abrasives are usually not used alone in cleaning agents. For example, a cream or paste meant for cleaning utensils contain about 80 % of finely ground limestone, along with other substances such as bleaches, anionic surfactants, alkaline builders, and perfumes.
<br>
<br><strong>DEGREASING AGENTS
</strong><br>They usually consist of strong alkalis, which can dissolve proteins and emulsify and disperse grease and similar substances. They are based on caustic soda or sodium metasilicate. Sodium carbonate (washing soda) can also be used. They are basically used as stain removers and for clearing blocked drains, cleaning ovens and other industrial equipment. Extreme care should be taken in their use as they have high pH.
<br>
<br><strong>ACIDS AND TOILET CLEANSERS</strong>
<br>Cleaning agents with acidic properties react with water-soluble chemical deposits to produce water-soluble salts. Acids dissolve metals and are hence used to remove metal stains such as water stains in baths, hard water deposits around taps, tarnish on silver, copper and brass, etc.
<br>Weak acids include citric acid (lemon juice), acetic acid (vinegar). They are used for removing tarnish from copper and brass and mild water stains in baths. Strong acids are oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid.
<br>
<br><strong>STORAGE OF CLEANING AGENTS
</strong><br>Cleaning agents with a longer shelf life are usually bought in bulk because of the reduced costs that accrue from the economics of scale. other agents are bought and replenished periodically .storage of cleaning agents is crucial and the various points to be kept in mind .the points are listed below:
<br>Ensure that the storage racks are strong and with selves. Heavier containers must be kept on the bottom shelf.
<br>The store should be kept clean and well-ventilated at all times.
<br>● Ensure that the lids are tightly fitted.
<br>● When issuing cleaning agents use appropriate dispensers and measuring apparatus.
<br>● Ensure that no residual deposits of cleaning agents are left around the rims of the containers.
<br>● Avoid spillage, if a spill occurs, clean it up immediately.
<br>● Follow a systematic procedure for rotating stocks.
<br>● Organic solvents, strong reagents, polishes should be kept away from heat sources.
<br>● Check stock regularly the store should be locked when not in use.
<br>
<br><strong>Distribution and Controls ; Cleaning Agents
</strong><br>
<br><strong><em>Issuing of the cleaning agents can be done in the following ways:
</em></strong><br><strong>Requisition
</strong><br>Each peripheral storage area will have a requisition book with forms in triplicate. Every time good are required, the person responsible for the storage area will complete the form and sign it. The top copy of this form will then be taken or sent to the central store prior to the collection time, where it will be checked by the supervisor and the items put together for collection by the cleaner. The second copy will go to the housekeeper responsible for cleaning expenditure. The third copy will remain in the book which is returned with fresh supplies.
<br>
<br><strong>Full for empty/ new for old
</strong><br>This system is used extensively in smaller establishments. Individual cleaners will take empty containers or old dusters, etc. to the central store and will be given a replacement in return.
<br>
<br><strong>Topping up
</strong><br>At a fixed time each day or week, the cleaners will take their containers to the main store to be topped up. This avoids the danger of running out of supplies. In some establishments, cleaners will deposit their bucket of cleaning agents in the main store at the end of each day or regular intervals. These will be replenished ready for collection at the start of the next shift.
