<br>
<br>The last interaction of the guest with the hotel staff takes place during the final phase of the guest cycle—check-out. During check-out, guests formally Vacate their rooms, settle their bills, and leave the hotel. This phase is very crucial as guests settle their financial transactions with the hotel, and any dispute at this stage can ruin their entire experience. On the other hand, a smooth settlement of bills and check-out would enhance the guests' experience. As every hotel endeavors to achieve high levels of guest satisfaction, the activities of the various department should be coordinated to ensure a smooth check-out. The speed and accuracy in the preparation and presentation of bills will lead to the maximization of guest satisfaction. Error-free billing and speedy processing of check-out requests reflects the professionalism of the hotel and imparts a lasting good impression to the guest.
<br>
<br>The departure procedure may vary slightly from hotel to hotel according to the degree of automation of the organization. The following steps are involved in the departure procedure in manual or semi-automated systems:
<br>
<br>● The check-out request is received at the front desk or bell desk.
<br>● The front desk sends a bell boy to transfer the guest's luggage from the room to the lobby.
<br>●The bell boy fills the departure errand card.
<br>● The front desk sends departure notification slips (DNS) to all concerned departments
<br>● The front desk alerts all points of sale to rush last-minute credit transactions to the front desk.
<br>● The front desk cashier updates the guest folio based on recent bills received from the points of sales.
<br>● The guest arrives at the front desk for check-out and hands over the room keys.
<br>● The cashier prepares the master bill and presents it to the guest, along With supporting vouchers and bills, for review.
<br>● The payment is received from the guest as per the pre-determined mode of payment.
<br>● The front desk makes the 'luggage out' pass 
<br>● Marketing activities are carried out—the front desk communicates special offers, gives out brochures, takes future bookings, etc.
<br>● The front desk communicates the check-out information to housekeeping and all the other concerned departments.
<br>● The front office assistant updates the following front office records:
<br>
<br>
<br>1. Current room status—by removing the name slip from the room rack at the information desk.
<br>2. Guest history card.
<br>3. Arrival/Departure register.
<br>
<br><strong>Check-out Request</strong> A request for check-out is received from the guest either at the front desk or at the bell desk. This information is communicated to all the concerned departments and points of sales. While processing the check-out request, the front desk agent should confirm the guest's details like name, room number, etc., and check the departure date. In case of early departure (i.e., the guest would like to leave before the departure date mentioned at the time of registration), other departments should be informed.
<br>
<br>Luggage Handling The front desk requests the bell captain to send a bell boy to transfer the guest’s luggage to the lobby. The bell boy fills the departure errand card and the bell captain makes an entry in the bell captain control sheet. The bell boy goes to the guest room, knocks on the door, and announces himself. After getting due permission from the guest, he enters the room and carries the guest’s luggage to the lobby.
<br>Apart from carrying the luggage of the guest, the bell boy is also expected to do the following:
<br>
<br>● Look around the room for signs of any damage to the hotel property.
<br>● Draw the curtains and lock the balcony and windows.
<br>● Check for any guest belongings left behind by mistake.
<br>● Collect the room keys from the guest.
<br>● Check the mini-bar consumption or politely enquire from the guest about the same.
<br>● Lock the room and hang the 'clean my room' tag on the doorknob, so that the housekeeping department can quickly clean the room for the next occupant.
<br>
<br><strong>Accounting All Transactions</strong> The front desk informs housekeeping and all points of sale to rush the latest credit transactions to the front desk so that the cashier can add them to the guest account. It is very difficult to get payment for unpaid bills after the guest has checked out unless she has gone to another hotel in the same chain or is going to return to the hotel later. As the guest might refuse to pay any charges after she has checked out, the hotel should ensure that all transactions have been billed to the guest at the time of account settlement.
<br>
<br><strong>Updating Guest Folio </strong>The front desk cashier updates the guest folio by Adding the latest credit transactions received from the points of sale.
<br>● Checking if any late checkout charges are applicable; i.e., if the check-out time is 12 noon and the guest checks out at 6 p.m., he will be charged for late check-out.
<br>● Checking for any late charges, i.e., if there are any latest bills that have not been added to the guest account.
<br>● Examining the current entries in the guest account.
<br>
<br><strong>Bill </strong>Guest bills are prepared based on guest folios. While preparing the bill, the front desk staff should check if late check-out charges are applicable. If so, they should be added to the master bill. The check-out time is the time fixed by the hotel to mark the end of the day. A departing guest should vacate the room by the check-out time, which is generally 12 noon, else he would incur late check-out charges. Late check-out charges are normally a point of contention between the hotel and the guest. To avoid such a situation, guests are often asked about their expected departure time at the reservation stage itself. At the time of registration, they are again informed about the extra charges in case of late check-out.
<br>
<br>The front desk cashier should also pay special care to late charges while preparing the bills for settlement. A late charge is an outstanding payment from the guest, the bill for which reaches the front desk cashier after the master bill has been prepared. Some common examples of late charges are:
<br>● Laundry bills
<br>● Telephone bills
<br>● Breakfast bills
<br>● Mini-bar consumption
<br>
<br>If the late charges reach the front desk after the guest has settled his bill and checked out, the hotel will have to bear the loss. To reduce the losses due to the late arrival of charges, the cashier should confirm from all the points of sale about any outstanding charges for the departing guest and also enquire about the mini-bar consumption from the guest before<br>● Preparing the master bill.
<br>● In manual hotel operation, the front office follows the given procedure to prepare a guest’s bill:
<br>● Prepare bills in duplicate.
<br>● Check the room number.
<br>● Take out the guest folio.
<br>● Calculate the correct number of room nights and establish whether a late check-out charge is to be added.
<br>● Enter the guest’s credit transactions in the master bill in the order of their occurrence.
<br>● Enter the method of payment (cash, credit card, the bill to a company, etc.).
<br>● Present the bills, along with supporting vouchers, to the guest for review.
<br>● Once the guest has verified the charges and made the payment, give the top copy of the bill to the guest.
<br>● File the second copy in the night auditor’s file.
<br>
<br><strong>Determination of Mode of Payment</strong> The method of settlement of bills is generally established during registration or even before, at the reservation stage. The methods of payment of bills may be cash—in local and foreign currency; cash equivalents like demand draft, traveler’s cheque, and a debit card; or through credit modes like a charge card, credit card, travel agent vouchers, and corporate billings. The front desk is generally aware about the mode of settlement of bills. This information
<br>helps the front desk cashier to do necessary verification in case of credit payments or take authorization from superiors in case the bill is to be settled by personal cheque, which is normally not entertained by most of the hotels.
<br>
<br><strong>Receiving Payment</strong> The guest reviews the bill and makes the payment in the pre-decided mode. The payment may be made through currency notes, traveler’s cheque, personal cheque, demand draft, debit card, credit card, charge card, travel agent voucher, and a bill to the company. The front desk cashier follows the house policy in collecting the payment from the guest.
<br>
<br><strong>Marketing Activity</strong> As the guest and the hotel staff come face-to-face for the last time at the check-out stage, the front office should use this opportunity for marketing efforts in the following ways:
<br>● The front desk should ask guests about their experience at the hotel and ask them to fill a feedback form.
<br>● If guests have any complaints, the front desk should note the same and assure the guests of a quick resolution.
<br>● The front desk agent should inform the guest about upcoming special offers.
<br>● The front desk agent may suggest making a future reservation for the guest’s return trip or a hotel in the same chain at the guest’s next destination.
<br>
<br><strong>Communicating Departure to All Departments</strong> The front desk informs all. departments about the departure of a guest to ensure the smooth operation of the hotel. The points of sale will not offer credit facility to guests who have already settled their bills and politely ask them to make a direct payment. The housekeeping department will do the following:
<br>
<br>● Prepare the room for the next guest.
<br>● Block the room for special cleaning processes, like spring cleaning.
<br>● Look for maintenance requirements in the room.
<br>● Re-furnish the room for future sales.
<br>
<br>To ensure proper room management, both the front office and housekeeping must inform each other of the change in room status. As soon as a guest checks out, the front office must inform the housekeeping so that the latter cleans the room and makes it available for sale. A flow of information in the reverse direction is equally necessary. The housekeeping prepares the ‘housekeeping report’ at the end of a shift, which indicates the housekeeping status of each room—whether rooms are
<br>ready for occupation, under repair, or out of order. The housekeeping department uses room status codes to indicate the status of rooms. This report is sent to the front office, where it is compared to the front office occupancy report and discrepancies are sorted out. The close coordination between the front office and housekeeping keeps the room status information up-to-date, leading to maximum benefit to the hotel.
<br>
<br><strong>Updating Front Office Records</strong> When some guests depart from a hotel, the rooms they had been occupying become vacant. The front desk agent should update the hotel records related to room status at the earliest so that the rooms can be sold again. The front office should also update guest history cards for marketing and research purposes.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Room status records</em></strong> As soon as a guest checks out, the front desk agent updates the following records related to the status of the room:
<br>● The front office removes the name of the guest from the room rack at the information desk, so that the room shows as vacant and can be given to another guest.
<br>●&nbsp; The front desk changes the status of the room in the front office occupancy report from occupied to vacant/dirty, so that the room can be cleaned and made ready for another guest.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Guest history</em></strong> card Generally, most hotels maintain a record of their guests, with details like previous arrival and departure dates, type of room and rate charged, likes and dislikes of guests, the amount spent by them, any special requests. This record is known as the guest history card or GHC. Hotels prepare the GHCs of corporate clients also. A GHC serves the following purposes:
<br>● It provides current marketing data.
<br>● The demo-graphical data of the guest—age, sex, income, occupation, marital status, etc_—helps to develop new marketing strategies.
<br>● The knowledge of the guest’s likes and dislikes helps in serving the guest better.
<br>● The information in GHC reveals the frequency of a guest’s visits. If the guest is a frequent user of the hotel, her name may be entered in the frequent user, list and promotional offers and special rates may be offered to her.
<br>
<br><strong>Departure Procedure in Fully Automated System
</strong><br>The departure procedure in a hotel running on a fully automated system is smoother and more efficient. It involves the following steps:
<br>● The check-out request is received at the front desk or bell desk.
<br>● The front desk sends a bell boy to transfer luggage from the guest room to the lobby.
<br>● The front desk informs all points of sale and other departments of the hotel about the departing guest through the interlinked computer network.
<br>● Since all the points of sale terminals are interlinked, any credit transaction of the guest will instantaneously get added to the guest folio.
<br>● The front desk prepares the master bill by selecting the bill option of the cashier module.
<br>● The front office presents the master bill, along with supporting vouchers, to the guest for review.
<br>● The payment is received from the guest as per the predetermined mode of payment.
<br>● The front office makes the luggage out pass.
<br>● The front desk communicates the departure of the guest to housekeeping and all the other concerned departments.
<br>● The front office records are updated automatically. These include:
<br>1. The auto removal of the name of the departed guest from the in-house guest name list.
<br>2.The automatic updating of the current room status—from occupied to vacant/dirty.
<br>3. The automatic updating of the guest history card.
