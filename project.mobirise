Nothing sends a stronger message than cleanliness in a hospitality operation. No level of service, friendliness, or glamour can equal the sensation a guest has upon entering a spotless, tidy, and conveniently arranged room.

This is the area where housekeeping staff report for duty and sign out at the end of the shift. Notice boards, telephones, computers, storage shelves (for registers and files), lost and found cupboard, key racks etc. are present here.\n<br>\n<br>• LAUNDRY: The place in the hotel where washing, pressing, dry cleaning, folding of linen and uniform of the hotel takes place.\n<br>\n<br>• LINEN ROOM: The linen room is the place where the linen of the hotel are stored, collected &amp; circulated throughout the hotel. i.e. of linen- bed sheets, towels, table covers etc.\n<br>\n<br>• UNIFORM ROOM: The place from where uniforms are collected, stored and distributed to the staff of the hotel.\n<br>\n<br>• SEWING ROOM: The place in the department where stitching and repair of linen and uniforms takes place.\n<br>\n<br>• HOUSEKEEPING STORES: This is the storage area in the department where the cleaning agents, cleaning equipment's, guest supplies are stored for the daily housekeeping functions and are securely locked.\n<br>\n<br>• FLOWER ROOM: Ideally should be an air-conditioned room to keep flowers fresh for arrangements in the hotel.

These are located on each guest floor to keep a stock of linen, guest supplies, and maid’s cart and cleaning supplies for that particular floor. A floor pantry stores a complete set of linen for the whole floor over and above what is already in circulation in the rooms. \n<br>\n<br>The floor pantries are away from guest’s view and should be situated  near the service elevators. It should store all housekeeping items so that the housekeeping staff does not have to keep going back to the housekeeping department or linen room for any item. Since the floor pantry is used to stock expensive items such as linen, it should remain locked at all times when not in use. The key to the floor pantry is kept by the GRA of that floor and a duplicate is kept with the floor supervisor. \n<br>\n<br>The following should be provided in a floor pantry:\n<br>\n<br>• Cupboards to store guest supplies, cleaning agents and equipment.\n<br>\n<br>• Shelves and racks to store fresh room linen.\n<br>\n<br>• Linen trolleys to store fresh and soiled linen and for transporting/dispatching the same to the linen and uniform room.\n<br>\n<br>• A notice board to display information regarding expected arrivals, VIPs in the house, extra bed, and guest loan items given to guests.\n<br>\n<br>• A sink with hot and cold water facilities to wash or disinfect glasses, fill drinking water in flasks, and for flower arrangements.\n<br>\n<br>• Guest loan items such as roll away beds, cribs, and bed boards.\n<br>\n<br>• It should have shelves and cupboards for linen and supplies, and\n<br>\n<br>sufficient area to park a room maid’s cart.\n<br>\n<br>• It should have a sink with water supply.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Housekeeping is also one of the backbone of the hotel industry. The hotel business depends on the guest. A frequent guest knows the difference between a good and mediocre hotel. To him, a hotel is both a home and an office which will be visited many times in a year. In a competitive situation, the guest will choose a hotel in which he feels welcomed. The guests want just more than wine and dine. Housekeeping is the department that is perhaps responsible to bring back the guest to the hotel again and again. This is so because the guest wants personal recognition and the housekeeping department has ample scope to pay attention so to all guests, thus making them feels important.\n<br>\n<br>Moreover, this is the department that is indirectly responsible for earning the maximum revenue for the hotel. The rooms sold by the front office are the rooms made by the housekeeping. We must remember that rooms are the most perishable commodity in a hotel.\n<br>\n<br><b>Importance of Housekeeping\n</b><br>• Hotel’s largest margin of profit comes from the sale of rooms because a room once made can be sold over and over again. Housekeeping helps in the sale of rooms (FO can sell the room only when the HK cleans &amp; makes them ready for sale). A good hotel operation ensures optimal sales to get maximum profit.\n<br>• Room sale is also dependent on the quality of decor, room facilities, cleanliness, and safety of room which is ensured by the housekeeping department.\n<br>• It creates a “home away from home” experience\n<br>• Maintains guest satisfaction by providing a clean, comfortable &amp; safe environment\n<br>• Contributes towards the reputation of the hotel\n<br>• Helps in getting repeat business. Unless the room décor is appropriate, the air odour free plus cleanliness all over, the hotel may lose the guest as a potential repeat customer.\n<br>• Satisfied guests also spread the word of mouth about the property which helps in getting more business.\n<br>• Makes sure that the other departments work also goes on smoothly\n<br>• The tasks performed by a housekeeping department are critical to the smooth operation of any hotel and it is a 24 X 7 X 365 operation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of Housekeeping\n</b><br>1. First Impression: Housekeeping helps us to give a good impression to any customer because when a customer first comes into a hotel, he/she will feel good to see the good system regarding decoration &amp; make his/her visit again and again.\n<br>2. Home Away From Home: Housekeeping provides a home away from home because when any customer takes a room &amp; sees that everything that a room requires is placed on its right place &amp; all the facilities like home are there in the room so he/she will feel that he/she is not away from home.\n<br>3. Repeat Business: When a customer will be satisfied with the services provided by the hotel &amp; also likes the decoration or view of the hotel, he/she will visit the same hotel again&amp; again. Also, he/she will tell others to be the customer of that hotel so we can say that housekeeping plays the role of repeat business.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Housekeeping\n</b><br>The benefits to be given from adopting planned housekeeping and or maintenance subsystem can be considered in financial, aesthetic, and human terms.\n<br><br>• Aesthetic Benefit: Any area looks more attractive if it is maintained clean and if things are placed in the right place and this is achieved by good housekeeping practices. Cleaning is not only essential to retain the appearance of surfaces and total areas, both inside and outside the building but also helps in improving appearance e.g. Floor seals. Appearance and apparent cleanliness do have a psychological effect on the building user – who may value judgment of total experience based on his perception of an initial view of appearance and standards of cleanliness.\n<br>\n<br>• Financial Benefit: Financial benefit refers to good earnings of the hotel when the customer or guests will come again &amp; again so the hotel will get more revenue or earnings that will give financial benefits to the hotel. Over a period of time, it proves more cost-effective to provide cleaning and maintenance services on a regular planned schedule basis. This helps in extending the life span of equipment surfaces, furniture, fittings, and furnishings. Thus deferring the heavy expenditure of frequent replacement or renovation.\n<br>\n<br>• Human Benefit: These benefits are divided into two ways:\n<br><br>1. Guest Benefit: Clean, attractive, well-maintained surroundings are more pleasant, enjoyable, and comfortable for clients to use, increase customer satisfaction, affect repeat business. Housekeeping provides a good facility to the guest so that he feels good &amp; gives them a proper place to stay out of the home without any feeling that we are away from home.\n<br><br>2. Employee Benefit: Employees get a good atmosphere for doing their work or job which is made possible if the hotel has good housekeeping practices. If employees get a good working atmosphere it increases their morale, they work hard &amp; efficient works lead to an increase in the revenue. This in turn not only affects labour turnover and recruitment, but it also contributes to creating hygiene and safety hazards.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Both customers and businesses can benefit from advances in communication, reservations and guest services systems. Technology allows continuous communication and streamlines the guest experience, from reservation to checkout.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a Hotel PMS?\n</b><br>A hotel property management system (PMS) is a set of solutions that hoteliers use to manage their day-to-day hotel operations activities such as reservations, front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, billing and invoicing, analytics and reporting. All of these activities can be labour and time-intensive, so the goal of a modern (Cloud-Based) PMS system is to save hotel managers and their employees time and money.\n<br>In recent years, property management systems have increased their capabilities and moved beyond just completing basic front-office tasks. With a PMS system, you can now offer loyalty programs to guests, gather and analyze data, manage food and beverage services and more. But many hotels still rely on outdated and time-consuming methods to manage their property. Running a hotel is a complex business, and it’s important to stay on top of the latest technology to get ahead in a competitive market. Using a modern PMS can help you stay ahead of your competitors and make sure that your guests have a great experience.\n<br>\n<br><b>IMPORTANCE OF USING COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN FRONT OFFICE\n</b><br>    * Reduces paper work\n<br>    * Environment friendly\n<br>    * Saves time\n<br>    * Increases efficiency\n<br>    * Reduces error\n<br>    * Increases speed and guest satisfaction\n<br>    * Improves co-ordination among different hotel departments\n<br>\n<br><b>PMS APPLICATION IN FRONT OFFICE\n</b><br>The PMS application for the front office has different modules for the efficient functioning of the whole department. Some of the common modules used in front office are: reservations module, front desk module, rooms module, cashier module, night audit module, set up module, report generation module, and back office module.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reservations Module\n</b><br>The reservations module is used to create and manage guest reservations, both for individuals as well as groups.

With this module, the management can quickly access information such as the availability of rooms on a particular day, the number of guests arriving on a specific day, listing of guests' folio balances, outstanding balance reports, etc. The access to reports can be customized through the use of filters.\n<br>\n<br><b>Back Office Module\n</b><br>The back office module provides an integrated system for managing the hotel's financial and statistical information. It simplifies accounting processes such as posting of accounts payable, transfer of accounts receivables, compilation of the payroll, budget preparation, and the production of the hotel's profit-and-loss statement and balance sheet. The financial information entered on a terminal in back office updates all accounting records. The back office module is also linked with the night audit module, which helps in streamlining the accounting process.\n<br>\n<br><b>PMS INTERFACE WITH STAND-ALONE SYSTEMS\n</b><br>When the PMS is integrated with other stand-alone automation systems like points of sale, energy management system, call accounting system, and electronic locking system, it becomes more effective and useful for hotel operations.\n<br>\n<br>1. Point of Sales In a hotel, the points of sale (POS) are the products/services other than accommodation from where the hotel generates revenue. These include restaurants, bars, discotheque, night club, health center, etc. Each point of sale is equipped with a stand-alone automated support for billings. If this is linked with the PMS, the data is immediately transferred to other modules for further processing. For example, a resident guest's credit sale in a restaurant will be immediately transferred to the cashier module, where it will be posted in the respective guest folio.\n<br>2. Call Accounting System Hotels provide telephone facility to their guests. The resident guests can make local as well as long distance calls from the comfort of their rooms. The call accounting system is a stand-alone automated system, which tracks all outgoing and incoming calls. It has the following features: identification of outward dialing, automatic route selection, and call rating programme. When the call accounting system is integrated with the PMS interface, the calls are automatically posted in the respective caller's account.\n<br>3. Energy Management System An energy management system is designed to manage the operations of equipment’s and instruments that consume energy. One typical function would be to shut down the operations of equipment’s that are not is use; for example, when a guest locks his room with the electronic key, the weather control system and lights are automatically turned off.\n<br>4. Electronic Locking System The electronic locking system is used widely nowadays. This system helps the hotels to control access to guest rooms. Only a person with the proper card key coded for the specific room can enter that room. When the electronic locking system is networked with the PMS, the front desk person is able to code the room keys for the guests. The coding is such that the key will become non-functional after the check-out time on the date of departure.\n<br>\n<br><b>DIFFERENT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n</b><br>There are several companies that provide the PMS software to hotels, with their own unique features to suit the different requirements of various hotels. Some of the companies providing PMS software also provide other tailor-made products to their clients. Micros, Amadeus, IDS Fortune, and Shaw Man are some of the major companies that provide the PMS software.

Opera\n<br>    2. MARSHA\n<br>    3. Taj Central Reservation System\n<br>    4. Leading Hotels of the World\n<br>    5. Utell\n<br>    6. Best Western Hotels\n<br>    7 . Welcomnet\n<br>    8. Holiday Inn Worldwide\n<br>\n<br><b>Points to consider while selecting a PMS\n</b><br>1. Budget: Budget must be a consideration while selecting a Property Management System for your hotel. A small hotel may want to opt for a local, lesser known brand for the cost constraints while bigger hotels may opt for well known brands as they can afford it.\n<br>2. Brand: Well known PMS brands are considered reliable which may help bigger hotels to decide upon selecting hotel management software based on their brand image.\n<br>3. Cost of Operation: The hardware (computer, printer, back-up discs etc) used by the PMS should be replaceable at a reasonable cost. Costs for operating supplies, such as paper and cartridges should also be reasonable. Systems that require such hardware part which cannot be obtained economically, readily and locally should be avoided.\n<br>4. Ease of Installation: Hotel’s operate 24hrs a day and 7 days a week, so any disruption in the continuous operation of its PMS can affect the hotel and its guests. Before selecting a new PMS, the FOM should thoroughly investigate the amount of time required in the installation of the new system. Installation time and its actual cost must be a common consideration in the selection of a new PMS.\n<br>5. Ease of Use: New Front Office employees must learn how to use the PMS. The ease with which they can learn the system is a factor in reducing training costs and increasing the pace at which new employees become comfortable operating the system.\n<br>6. Ease of Interface Integration: Information needed by FOMs to professionally manage Front Office comes from a variety of sources. Hotels use many automatic systems like card-key machines, telephone systems which must interface with the PMS for operational utility and efficiency.\n<br>7. Maintenance Requirements: Like any other hotel equipment, the PMS must be properly maintained to operate efficiently. The cost of effective preventive maintenance may vary from one PMS to another. The FOM must determine and understand the time and money required to minimize down time and to maximize system efficiency by providing routine, ongoing maintenance.\n<br>8. Ease and Frequency of Upgrading: Technology advances at a fast pace. Hardware and software upgrades are routinely issued by manufacturers, and most of these significantly improve the operational effectiveness of a PMS. FOMs should anticipate significant increases in demand for up gradation, memory, and speed and should provide for the same at the time of procurement.\n<br>9. Quality and Availability of Support Services: A PMS is a computerized system and is vulnerable to hardware malfunctioning, software glitches, and potentially damaging intrusive viruses. Support services personnel, preferably via a toll free telephone number must be accessible on a 24 hrs and 7 days basis.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Using Hotel Management System\n</b><br>Year of 2000, as many as 25% of Indian hotels still reported using pen and paper or Excel spreadsheets to manage all of their front-office tasks like room bookings, billing, and room availability. This can be an inefficient way to do things in the long run. And what would happen if your spreadsheet or paper records got lost or destroyed?\n<br>Using a hotel management system can save you time by automating recurring tasks like updating room rates and availability, sending out reminder emails to guests prior and upon arrival, and invoicing your guests. You can also connect your property management system to a channel manager so that you can take bookings on various channels online, and they will all arrive in your PMS, so you have a way to easily keep track of them all in one place. With a PMS system, your staff spends less time on administrative tasks and more time on satisfying your guests.\n<br>Using a modern hotel management system can increase your revenue by tracking your performance and gathering data about your hotel, analyzing it, and creating reports. From there, you’ll be able to see a clear overview of how your hotel is doing, and you can use this data to make better decisions about how to run the business. For example, you can use your property management system to adopt a dynamic pricing strategy, so you can keep more of your rooms filled at rates that make the customer happy.\n<br><br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Since rooms are the major responsibility of housekeeping, it has a very important role to play. Thus housekeeping works in a very close relationship with the front office, Maintenance &amp; etc.​ \n<br>​The housekeeping department, is just one of the department in a hotel working towards the satisfaction of the guests, and each department is dependent on others for information and services if its work is to be accomplished effectively.​The Housekeeping Department should co-ordinate and ensure maximum co-operation with other departments to provide high quality service. A well planned work schedule should be prepared so as to ensure minimum disruption to the guests and work flow of other departments. The executive housekeeper is responsible for ensuring this by supervising a group of staff or working closely with staff from other departments.\n<br>The housekeeping departments cooperated with the following department in the industry. Receptions, restaurant, security, kitchen and account etc.\n<br>Hospitality is the provision of basic needs of food, shelter and recreational facilities to clients in order to make them story pleasant and comfortable.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A front office accounting system monitors and charts the transactions of guest and businesses, agencies, and other non-guests using the hotels services and facilities. The front offices ability to perform accounting tasks in a perfect and complete manner will directly affect the hotels ability to collect the hotels outstanding balances.\n<br>The resident or in-house guests of a hotel are those who are staying in the hotel. They seldom pay on the spot for the use of hotel services and facilities like restaurants, laundry, fitness centre, spa, salon, and so on. They sign the bills to verify their use of the services and the amount incurred. The bills are posted in their folio, and a final consolidated bill is made at the time of their departure. In other words, the hotel provides credit facility at the time of the utilization of the hotel services to the resident guests. An accurate posting of the guest accounts is very essential to ensure the guest's goodwill and the recovery of all the charges incurred by the guest.\n<br>In order to maximize revenue, hotels offer some services and facilities to non-resident guests as well. These may include the use of the fitness and health centre, swimming pool, club facilities, food and beverage outlets, and so on. When these services and facilities are offered to non- resident guest on credit, the account of the same is maintained by the front office cashier. As the number of financial transactions that take place between a hotel and its guests (resident and non-resident) is very high, the front desk cashier should maintain the guest accounts accurately and properly.\n<br>However, the collection of a non-resident account is not the responsibility of the front desk; it is collected by the accounts department. Also, when a resident guest, whose account is to be settled by his company, checks out from the hotel after signing the bills, his account turns into a non-guest account, and the collection responsibility shifts from the front desk to the accounts section.\n<br>\n<br><b>The major functions of front office accounting system are as under:\n</b><br>• Creation and maintenance of guest and non-guest accounts accurately.\n<br>• Tracking financial transactions of guests throughout the guest cycle.\n<br>• Monitoring the credit limit of guests, and asking for a deposit from guests in case of high outstanding balance.\n<br>• Preparing a high balance report for collection and informing the management about the same.\n<br>• Providing an efficient management information system (MIS) to the management for departmental revenue generation.\n<br>• Maintaining effective control over cash and credit transactions.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Accounts</b>\n<br>The front desk maintains two types of accounts:\n<br>\n<br>• Guest accounts\n<br>• Non-guest accounts\n<br>\n<br><b>Guest Account</b> A guest account is the record of financial transactions between and a resident guest and the hotel. This account is created either during the registration of the guest at the time of check-in) or during reservation, if the guest makes an advance The front office creates an individual folio for each guest—for maintaining a record of all the financial transactions that take place during the stay of the guest. On the basis of a guest's folio, the final bill is prepared and presented to the guest for collection.\n<br>Hotels generally extend credit facility to guests for the use of the services and products provided by them. They fix an upper limit to the credit facility, which is known as the house limit. When the credit balance of the guest exceeds the house limit, the front desk cashier may ask the guest to make a part or full payment of the outstanding balance.\n<br>\n<br><b>Non-guest Account</b> A non-guest account is the record of the financial transactions that take place between a non-resident guest and the hotel. This is also known as a city account. The front desk cashier maintains records of financial transactions between the hotel and a local resident to whom the hotel has extended the credit facility for the use of hotel facilities and services. Besides local guests, the front desk cashier also maintains other types of non-guest accounts, which include:\n<br>\n<br>• Guests who leave the hotel without the settlement of their accounts are known as skippers; their accounts are also treated as non-resident guest accounts. The account is transferred to the city ledger awaiting eventual payment, and after a stipulated wait time, the same is written off as a bad debt.\n<br>• The status of guests, whose accounts are not settled by them (in case of bills to company), changes from resident to non-resident guests when they leave the hotel. The front office cashier transfers the balance to the city ledger and the payment is collected by the accounts department.\n<br>• When advance payment has been received for a guaranteed reservation and it’s subsequently a no-show, the account is normally recorded in the sales ledger.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Guest Allowances\n<br>\n<br>8. Restaurant/Bar Check\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Visitors Paid-out </b>The money paid by the hotel on behalf of guests is known as visitors paid-out (VPO). A VPO is generally made for the following charges:\n<br>\n<br>• Payment for taxi, travel agency services\n<br>\n<br>• Porter charges\n<br>\n<br>• Florist charges\n<br>\n<br>• Postage and courier charges\n<br>\n<br>• Emergency medical expenses\n<br>\n<br>The paid-outs are made from the cash bank that is maintained by the front office cashier. A proper authorization should be taken from the lobby manager before making the VPO. To make a paid-out, one should:\n<br>\n<br>• Confirm the name, room number, and identity of the guest.\n<br>\n<br>• Fill the paid-out voucher properly, mentioning the details of services paid for it.\n<br>\n<br>• Get the VPO authorized by the lobby manager.\n<br>\n<br>• Make the payment.\n<br>\n<br>• Post the entry in the guest folio and place the voucher in the folio docket.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Miscellaneous Charge Voucher</b> A miscellaneous charge voucher is prepared for the payment of miscellaneous services and facilities, like laundry, health club, fitness centre, beauty salon, etc. The guest verifies and signs the miscellaneous charge voucher, which is sent to the front desk cashier for posting the charges into the guest folio.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Cash Receipt Voucher</b> A receipt is an acknowledgment that a payment has been made. A cash receipt voucher is prepared and issued to the person depositing cash as a proof of remittance of the deposited cash.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Telephone Call Voucher</b> Nowadays a lot of hotels use computerized systems, where, whenever a guest makes a call, the call accounting module automatically transfers the call charges to the guest folio. In small hotels, where outgoing calls are routed through the operator, the responsibility of billing the call charges lies with the telephone operator, who puts down the call details on a telephone charge voucher and sends it to the front desk cashier for posting into the guest account.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Travel Agent Voucher</b> Most tour operators and travel agencies receive advance payment from their clients for making travel arrangements like accommodation, food and beverage, and other services. The travel agency then makes the reservation in a hotel on behalf of the guest. It sends a voucher, known as a travel agent voucher, containing the details of the billing procedure and services to be provided to the guest. Airlines that have contracts with hotels also send meals and accommodation order (MAO) or passenger service order (PSO) for layover passengers due to delay or cancellation of flights. In these cases, the hotel obtains payments from the travel agency or airline.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Commission Voucher</b> Hotels offer commission to persons who provide regular business to them. Whenever a commission is paid by the cashier, a commission voucher is made. The commission voucher should be authorized by a competent authority of the hotel. Generally, it is authorized by the lobby manager. More commonly, commission vouchers are made for the following:\n<br>\n<br>• A taxi driver who brings a walk-in guest to the hotel. In case the guest stays at the hotel, the hotel pays a commission to the taxi driver.\n<br>\n<br>• A travel agent/tour operator working on commission basis (generally, the commission is 10 per cent on the room rates, excluding taxes).\n<br>\n<br>• Any agency working on a commission basis.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Guest Allowances</b> An allowance is an amount deducted from an invoice to compensate the buyer for an expense or mistake. The guest allowance is the cash paid to the guest by the hotel, especially in the following circumstances:\n<br>\n<br>• If there is a wrong posting of a charge in the guest folio, an allowance is given and the voucher is made to nullify the guest folio balance due to the wrong posting.\n<br>\n<br>• If a guest has deposited a large sum as advance and that amount exceeds the hotel bill.\n<br>\n<br>• If an airline or a tour operator sends a crew or a group and guarantees the reimbursement of their bills.\n<br>\n<br>Guest allowances are strictly controlled. The front desk cashier requires an authorization from a competent authority before making such a payment.\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Restaurant/Bar Check</b> Resident guests may enjoy their meals in any of the food and beverage outlets in a hotel. Whenever a guest consumes food or beverage in a restaurant, a bill is raised; in case a resident guest wishes to utilize the credit facility offered by the hotel, he should sign the bill. The signed bills serve as the proof of financial transactions at the food and beverage outlets and are treated as vouchers for posting the charges to the guest folio\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Folios\n</b><br>\n<br>Front office transactions are typically charted on account statement called folios. A folio is a statement of all transactions (debits &amp; credits) affecting the balance of a single account. When an account is created, it is assigned a folio with a starting balance of zero. All transactions which increase (debits) or decrease (credits) the balances of the account are recorded on the folio. At settlement, a guest folio should be returned to a zero balance by cash payment or by transfer to an approved credit card or direct billing account.\n<br>\n<br>The process of recording transactions on a folio is called posting. A transaction is posted when it has been recorded on the proper folio in the proper location and a new balance has been determined. When posting transactions, the front office may rely on hand written folios (if it is using a non-automated system), a machine-posted folios (with a semi-automated system), or computer-based electronic folios (with a fully automated system)\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of the posting technique used, the basic accounting information recorded on a folio remains the same. In a non-automated or semi-automated record keeping system, guest folios are maintained at the front desk. In a fully automated record keeping system, electronic folios are stored in a computer and can be retrieved, displayed, or printed on request.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>There are basically four types of folios used in front office accounting. They are:\n<br>\n<br><b>• Guest folios:-</b> accounts assigned to individual persons or guest rooms\n<br>\n<br><b>• Master folios:-</b> accounts assigned to more than one person or guest room; usually reserved for group accounts.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Non-guest or semi-permanent folios:-</b> accounts assigned to non-guest businesses or agencies with hotel charge purchase privileges.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Employee folios:- </b>accounts assigned to employees with charge purchase privileges. Executives like Sales and Marketing Director, Front Office Manager may charge the hotel for travel and entertainment to promote the business\n<br>\n<br>Additional types of folios are frequently created by front office management to accommodate special circumstances or requests. For e.g... A business guest may request that his or her charges and payments be split between two personal folios: one to record expenses to be paid by the sponsoring business, &amp; one to record personal expenses to be paid by the guest. This is referred to as a split folio. In this situation, two folios are created for one guest. If the room and tax portion are to be separated from other charges, the room and tax is posted to the room folio. This is sometimes called the A folio. Food, beverage, telephone, &amp; other charges are posted to the incidental folio or B folio.\n<br>\n<br>Every folio should have a unique serial number. Folio serial numbers are needed for many reasons. First, they serve as identification numbers that help ensure that all folios are accounted for during an audit of front office transactions. Second, folio numbers may be used to index information in automated system. Automated systems frequently create folio numbers when reservations are made. Folio numbers are then transferred to the front desk for use during registration. Finally, folio numbers can provide a chain of documentation. In non-automated &amp; semi-automated systems, folios have specific length &amp; can hold only a limited number of postings. When a balance must be carried forward to a new folio, the old folio numbers should be shown as a reference of where the balance originated.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Ledger\n</b><br>\n<br>A ledger is a collection of the same type of accounts. The front office ledger has a collection of folios. There are normally two ledgers maintained by the front office. One of them, as guest ledger, contains all the folio entries of resident guests; the other contains the folio entries of non-resident guest accounts and is known as city ledger.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Guest Ledger</b> A guest ledger contains the details of all the financial transactions between a resident guest and the hotel, including charge purchases and the payments received from the guest. It has two parts—debit and credit. By taking a  look at the guest ledger, one can find the credit or debit balance of an individual guest as well as the total credit or debit balance on date. In a manual system, the financial transactions are recorded in a tabular ledger, or tab ledger, which is of two types: \n<br>\n<br><br>• Horizontal tabular ledger\n<br>\n<br>• Vertical tabular ledger\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>* Horizontal tabular ledger In a horizontal tabular ledger, all the credit expenses of the guest are recorded in one horizontal row, and at the end of the row, the guests' credit or debit balance is shown. The vertical row of the table contains the room numbers. At the end of vertical column, the daily sales balance can be seen.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>* Visitors/Vertical tabular ledger A vertical tabular ledger is a variation of the horizontal tabular ledger. It is also called visitors tabular ledger. The rows depict the room numbers, and in the columns, the details of the guests and their credit expenses as well as payments are recorded. At the end of every column, one can find the account balance of individual guests staying in a particular room. It is a loose sheet and is prepared on a daily basis by the front desk cashier.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. City Ledger</b> A city ledger contains the collective accounts of all the non-resident individuals/agencies to whom the hotel extends credit facility. It is also called non guest account. City ledgers also contain the accounts of resident guests who have left the hotel without settling their accounts, which would be settled at a later date by a third party (may be a credit card company, an airline, a travel agency, or a corporate house). This account would be closed at the time of receiving the complete payment. The account of skippers is also maintained in the city ledger for a specific period (as per the hotel policy); at the expiry of this period the same is written off as bad debt and the account is closed. This ledger also includes bad cheque accounts (cheque's that have bounced), disputed bills account (bills that are in dispute), late charges accounts (bills that could not be posted in the guest bill at the time of check-out), and retention charges accounts (reservation was guaranteed but the same was cancelled or guest did not show up\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The front office accounting cycle has three distinct phases:\n<br>\n<br>1. Creation of accounts\n<br>2. Maintenance of accounts\n<br>3. Settlement of accounts\n<br>\n<br><b>Creation of Accounts\n</b><br>A guest account is created when the first financial transaction between the hotel and a guest takes place. It may happen at one of the following stages:\n<br>\n<br>• At the time of reservation, if the guest pays an advance amount (may be part or full). For example, Shreya is reserving a room for 25 to 28 December on 25 October. The dates fall under the black-out period, and hence, all reservations have to be guaranteed by full advance payment. She deposits Rs 18,000 towards the room rent for three nights, which is entered as the first transaction in her account.\n<br>• At the time the hotel receives the advance payment for a booking—after the reservation has been made and before the arrival of the guest. For example, Kiran has made a reservation for a room from 14 to 17 September on I July. She makes an advance payment of Rs 10,000 on 14 August; her guest account is created immediately and the transaction is entered in the same.\n<br>• At the time of guest registration, when a room is allotted to the guest. For example, Vijay from Microsoft India has made a reservation from I to 3 August. He submits the bill to company letter for the room rent at the time of registration on I August. His guest account is created and the day's room rent is posted in that. His sister, Anuja, also has a reservation for the same nights and she deposits a payment of Rs 5,000 for the same. Her account is also created on the same day with debit and credit information.\n<br>\n<br>A guest folio is created on the day the hotel receives a payment from the guest and the transactions are recorded in the order of their occurrence. The hotel sets a credit limit, known as floor limit, for each guest, which is the maximum amount of credit that the hotel will extend to the guest.\n<br>\n<br><b>Maintenance of Accounts\n</b><br>All the monetary transactions that take place between the hotel and a guest are recorded in the guest folio in the order of their occurrence. An entry in the guest folio may be either debit or credit.\n<br>\n<br>The most common debit entries in a guest account include the following:\n<br>• Room charges\n<br>• Food and beverage charges (restaurant, bar, coffee shop, room service, etc.) Telephone and fax charges\n<br>• Health centre, business centre, fitness centre charges\n<br>• Laundry charges\n<br>• Postage charges\n<br>• Transportation charges\n<br>• Visitors paid-out\n<br>Credit entries in a guest account may include the following:\n<br>• Pre-payment, in part or in full (at the time of reservation or between reservation and arrival).\n<br>• Part payment during the stay.\n<br>• Allowances given to the guest.\n<br>• Adjustments made in case of any error in posting in the guest folio. • Final payment for the settlement of accounts at the time of check-out.\n<br>\n<br><b>Settlement of Accounts\n</b><br>This is the final and concluding phase of the front office accounting cycle. The settlement of account means zeroing the balance in a guest folio. The formula for calculating the outstanding balance is:\n<br>\n<br>Opening balance + Debit entries — Credit entries = Outstanding amount\n<br>\n<br>The guest account may have a credit or debit balance during the stay of the guest. At the time of departure, the final bill of the guest is prepared and settled in such a way that the outstanding balance is brought to zero. If the advance paid by the guest is less than the total billing amount, the guest should pay the balance amount. For example, Shreya had made an advance payment of Rs 18,000 at the time of reservation. Her total bill at the time of check-out is 21,000, so she pays the balance of Rs 3,000 to the cashier. In case the amount paid in advance exceeds the billing amount, the balance is refunded to the guest to settle the guest account. For example, Kiran paid Rs 10,000 for her stay, but due to an emergency, she had to leave in a day and her bill came to Rs 4,500. The balance amount of Rs 5,500 is refunded to Kiran.\n<br>The settlement of the guest account may be by cash or credit. In case of credit settlement, the account balance is transferred to the city ledger and the responsibility of collecting the balance is transferred to the accounts department. For example, Vijay's room bill is sent to Microsoft India for settlement as per the billing instructions while the other bills are settled directly by him at the hotel as per actuals. Anuja's bills came to a total of Rs 5,000. As she had deposited the same amount as advance, she does not need to make any additional payment nor does the hotel need to give a refund. <br><br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The security department of the hotel is responsible for the overall security of the building, in-house guests, visitors, day users, and employees of the hotel. Guests hold the hotel responsible for their safety and can file for compensation in case of a security lapse in the hotel's security measures.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Security Staff and System\n</b><br>A hotel's security staff may include in-house security personnel and contracted security officer’s. Hotels generally prefer ex-army or ex-police officials as their officer’s because they are already well versed with various security aspects and have a lot of experience in the field. Security responsibilities may include patrolling the property, monitoring surveillance equipment and, in general ensuring that the guests, visitors and employees are safe and secure. The security department is responsible for establishing the details of room keys security, fire safety systems, emergency evacuation plans, and emergency communication plans. The effectiveness of the security department depends upon the cooperation and assistance of the local law enforcement officials. The security personnel should be trained to handle situations like vandalism, terrorist attacks, and bomb threats and also be trained to prevent and fight fire.\n<br>Every hotel should have a proper security system to protect its guests, employees, and their properties. Hotels take measures like installing closed circuit televisions in public areas for proper surveillance, ensuring proper lighting of public areas, and fencing of the hotel property. and positioning security guards at entry gates for the safety and security of their guests and their belongings. Hiring an independent security agency to routinely check the security systems also helps in ensuring the safety and security of guests.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of Front Office\n</b><br> A Front desk professional is required to assume a variety of roles during a variety of hours during a workday —chief among being a gatekeeper, communications expert, phone wiz trouble shooter and receptionist. As a hotel's first contact with guests, vendors, visitors, and delivery people, the front office staff is the eyes and ears of the organization. It is up to them to spot potential troublemakers, identify red-flag behaviors, prevent breaches of security, and act with confidence and authority when situations threaten to get out of hand.\n<br>A security programme would be effective if all the hotel employees participate in the hotel's security efforts .The front office personnel play a vital role in assisting the hotel's security personnel to carry out their tasks efficiently. The front office employees like door attendants, parking attendants, bell boys, and receptionists should observe all the people who are entering or leaving the hotel premises and if they notice any suspicious activity or circumstances, they should immediately report the same to the security personnel.\n<br>\n<br><b>SAFE DEPOSIT\n</b><br>Though the hotel is not responsible for the guest valuables, the rule to this effect is written in the guest registration card and also notified in the guest room. But a hotel offers a free safe deposit facility for his valuables.\n<br>Hotels have bank type of lockers installed at the front office cashier. A locker is allotted to guests that can be opened by using two keys. The master key is with the front office cashier and another key is issued to the guest. A contract is also signed in between the guest and the hotel. Whenever a guest wants to open that locker it has to be entered into the locker operating register. Signatures are always verified with the specimen. Head cashier inserts his key then a guest inserts his own key, and then only a lock can be opened. Guest is left alone to operate his locker. Guests can lock the locker with their own key. At the time of departure the guest is asked to vacate the locker.\n<br>If the key is lost by the guest, then the locker will be drilled open in presence of the guest and can be charged for the replacement of the locker.\n<br>If the forgets to vacate the locker, he or she has to be informed by the hotel to come and vacate it either personally or by sending an authorized person with an authority letter.\n<br>These days some hotels have installed an electronic safe deposit box in each guest room. This safety box can be operated by using an electronic number. Guests can use any number to open the lock. The number selected by the guest becomes the locker’s code number and the guests are advised to keep their valuables in the electronic safety box. Though the hotel is not responsible for any lost items. But hotels take this issue as a prestige issue So an inquiry is done on the hotel security level.\n<br>\n<br><b>Key Control\n</b><br>It is the duty and responsibility of the front desk staff to ensure the right guest is given the key to his room and his safety and security pertaining to issuance of key is not compromised or violated during his stay in the hotel.\n<br>A Front Desk Agent should never give keys, room numbers, messages, parcels or mails to any person without first requiring appropriate identification.\n<br>For Security reasons hotels use at least three types of keys, Emergency Key, Master key and guest room keys. Types of keys used may vary hotel by hotel but the process of handling them remains pretty much the same.\n<br>\n<br><b>When Guest Request for room key:\n</b><br>• Request for Guest’s last name and room number.\n<br>• Cross check the information given by guests against the reservation details on the hotel software (PMS).\n<br>• If there any mismatch is the details provided then request for any valid photo identification like passport, Driving license, government ID cards etc.\n<br>• Do not handover the room keys without proper authentication of the guest identity.\n<br>• If no picture identification is available by the guests, the Front office assistant must accompany the guests to the room to confirm the identity. When being challenged by our actions, we are to inform the guest:\n<br><b><i>“We are doing this for your security and safety. We appreciate your understanding.”\n</i></b><br>• Only in an emergency situation can we use the information on the guest passport number, date of birth, address given to the hotel on arrival etc. to ascertain the computer’s record.\n<br>• When in doubt with the identity and the guest refused to be escorted to the room, inform the Front office manager immediately. If the Team Leader or Assistant Manager – Front Office could recognize the guest, give the duplicate key to the guest while reinforcing politely why we need to perform the identity check.\n<br>• Check if the guest requires an additional key or if he has lost his previous key.\n<br>• If a guest requests an additional key, program a new key with duplicate code.\n<br>• If a guest has lost his previous key, program a key with new code.\n<br>• Present the new key to the guest\n<br>Keys must never be issued to persons claiming to have the guest’s permission to enter the room unless the guest has personally given his /her verbal or written authorization to the Front Office team.\n<br>Room numbers should not be written on the keys in case keys are misplaced. A set of codes are encoded to differentiate keys being held by guests.\n<br>\n<br><b>On Staff’s request entry into occupied room:\n</b><br>Only designated operational staff is allowed access to occupied guest rooms. They are: Bellboys, Concierge, Front Desk agents, Housekeeping Manager, Assistant Manager– Housekeeping / Team Leader / Designated Room Attendant and Laundry Attendant, Mini Bar, F&amp;B – Room Service Fruits Deliverer.\n<br>Key machines should constantly be in ‘log off” mode. Access code should be known only to those designated personnel and not shared among other staff.\n<br>Cashier may hand over the checked out room key to the bellman to collect luggage and check mini-bar and safe boxes. The bellman must return the used key to the same cashier after removing the luggage from the room.\n<br>\n<br><b>“Showroom” / Sales mock up rooms Keys\n</b><br>On a daily basis, a set of rooms will be blocked off for viewing purposes by the Duty Manager – Front Office.\n<br>Two sets of keys to these rooms will be programmed and placed at the Front Office Reception for site visit purposes.\n<br>Staff releasing the site visit keys must inform the receiver to return the keys back to the Reception upon completion.\n<br>\n<br><b>FIRE SAFETY\n</b><br>Fire is among the major potential hazards associated with hotels. It could take place due to cigarette smoking in rooms, faulty electrical wiring, or faulty equipment. Hotels must be equipped to safeguard guests and their property from fire by installing smoke detectors and by conducting routine checks to see that the wiring and equipment are not defective. All the employees must be aware of specific procedures laid down by the establishment and must be ready to comply with them at any time. There should be fire drills during low occupancy periods to check how the employees put their knowledge of laid down procedures into practice. Generally, fire extinguishers are installed in hotels at strategic locations and fire exits are earmarked for use in the event of fire. Guests should be made aware of the same.\n<br>The presence of three basic components—fuel (a combustible substance), oxygen (necessary as fire is an oxidation reaction), and heat (ignition temperature)—results in the outbreak of fire. If any one of them is absent, fire cannot break out. Fire can be extinguished by starving, smothering, and cooling\n<br>• Starving Starving is the removal of fuel from the vicinity of fire so that it doesn't spread. In case fire breaks out in an area where wood is stored, it can be extinguished by removing all the wood (fuel) from that area. This way one of the major components of fire will be eliminated.\n<br>• Smothering Smothering is the removal of air. Fire can be extinguished by cutting off the supply of air (oxygen), which is necessary for the existence of fire. Throwing a blanket over fire smothers the air and extinguishes the fire.\n<br>• Cooling Heat (ignition temperature) is also essential for the existence of fire. Cooling by adding water—brings down the temperature and puts out fire.\n<br>\n<br><b>Classification of Fire\n</b><br>Depending upon the combustible material that has caught fire, fire is classified in the following five groups:\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Fires\n</b><br>Not all fires are the same. Per NFPA 10, burning may be classified into one or more of the following fire classes and your fire protection specialist will select the right fire extinguisher size and agent for the hazard.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class A\n</b><br>Class A fires are fires in ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber, and many plastics.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class B\n</b><br>Class B fires are fires in flammable liquids such as gasoline, petroleum greases, tars, oils, oil-based paints, solvents, alcohols. Class B fires also include flammable gases such as propane and butane. Class B fires do not include fires involving cooking oils and grease.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class C\n</b><br>Class C fires are fires involving energized electrical equipment such as computers, servers, motors, transformers, and appliances. Remove the power and the Class C fire becomes one of the other classes of fire.\n<br>\n<b><br>• Class D\n</b><br>Class D fires are fires in combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, sodium, lithium, and potassium.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class K\n</b><br>Class K fires are fires in cooking oils and greases such as animal and vegetable fats.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedure in the Event of Fire\n</b><br>• The guidelines for the front office staff in the event of fire are as follows:\n<br>• When fire is detected, inform the concerned people immediately.\n<br>• Do not panic.\n<br>• Warn other people in the vicinity and sound the fire alarm\n<br>• Do not jeopardize your own safety or that of others.\n<br>• Follow the procedure laid down by your establishment\n<br>• Call the fire brigade immediately\n<br>• Dot not try to extinguish fire if you are not trained for the same; fire may spread if not handled properly\n<br>• If you are trained for firefighting, use the appropriate fire extinguisher to put out the fire.\n<br>• Close the doors and windows; turn off the supply of electricity and gas\n<br>\n<br>It is important that all the passageways are kept clear and the doors and windows are opened. Fire exits should be marked properly and should be visible in dark too. The fire extinguishers should be placed at proper places and should be in working condition. Fire drills should be carried out periodically. Fire detection systems, sprinkling systems, smoke detecting systems, fire fighting equipment, like fire hoses, etc. should be inspected and tested at regular intervals to ensure that they remain functional in the event of fire.\n<br>\n<br><b>ACCIDENTS</b>\n<br>According to Advanced Learner's dictionary, an accident is 'an unpleasant event that happens unexpectedly and causes injury or damage'. Accidents may occur due to any one of the following reasons:\n<br>\n<br>Excessive Haste Excessive haste is among the prime causes of accidents because a person in haste may overlook the safety rules or obstacles in the way. Therefore, to avoid accidents, one must not be in a hurry or run while on the job. For example, bell boys, when in a hurry to carry the luggage of a group, may overlook objects in blind corners and may meet with an accident.\n<br>\n<br>Carelessness Carelessness is also a common cause of accidents. The careless handling of goods and equipment may lead to accidents. For example, if a bell boy is careless with the luggage, he may trip and fall.\n<br>\n<br>Anxiety Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear about something. An anxious person will not be able to concentrate on the task at hand and this might lead to accidents.\n<br>\n<br>Lack of Interest If a person lacks interest in what she is doing, she becomes careless and doesn't follow the correct procedure for carrying out a task, leading to accidents.\n<br>\n<br>Lack of Concentration A person may not be able to concentrate on work due to personal problems, lack of interest, distractions, etc. The lack of concentration may lead to problems and accidents.\n<br>Failure to Apply Safety Rules Safety rules, if followed, prevent accidents. Before operating any equipment, one should read and follow the operating instructions given in the product manual in order to eliminate the chances of accidents. The failure to apply safety rules may cause accidents.\n<br>\n<br><b>Accidents in Hotels\n</b><br>In hotels, accidents usually happen in one of the following areas:\n<br>• Stairways\n<br>• Balconies or landings\n<br>• Ramps\n<br>• Parking lots\n<br>• Bathtubs or showers\n<br>To minimize the number of accidents and to avoid workplace injuries, the hotels should take care of the common problems, some of which are as follows:\n<br>• Presence of handrails/guardrails\n<br>• Presence of a non-slip surface\n<br>• Adequacy of landing areas\n<br>• The accident victim's field of vision\n<br>• The accident victim's health and behavior\n<br>• Adequacy of lighting\n<br>• Weather conditions (wet, snowy) and maintenance (cleaned, recently polished)\n<br>\n<br><b>Accident Report\n</b><br>In spite of all the precautions taken by hotels to prevent accidents, mishaps may still occur. If a staff member meets with an accident within the hotel premises, it must be reported to the management and a record of the accident must be entered in the accident book.\n<br>A proper reporting of accidents is important for the following reasons:\n<br>• The accident-prone areas may be identified so that appropriate signs may be placed there to avoid any future accidents.\n<br>• First aid may be given to the injured person.\n<br>• If the injury is serious, an ambulance may be summoned.\n<br>• The damage/loss due to the accident can be assessed.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It is mandatory for an establishment to have adequate first aid equipment, facilities, and trained personnel to provide first aid in the work area. If the injury is serious, the injured person should be treated by a doctor or a qualified nurse as soon as possible.\n<br>First Aid Box\n<br>There should be a first aid box in the work area and it should be easily identifiable and accessible. It should be in the charge of a responsible person, who should ensure that the consumed medicines are replenished and the expired medicines are replaced regularly. A first aid box must contain the following things:\n<br>• A card giving general first-aid guidance.\n<br>• Twenty individually wrapped, sterile, adhesive, waterproof dressings of various sizes.\n<br>• An antiseptic lotion and an antiseptic cream.\n<br>• Cotton wool packets (4 x 25 g).\n<br>• One dozen safety pins.\n<br>• Two triangular bandages.\n<br>• Two sterile eye pads, with attachment.\n<br>• Four medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Two large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Two extra large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Scissors\n<br>• A report book to record all injuries.\n<br>First Aid for Some Common Problems\n<br>• Shock The signs of shock are faintness, sickness, clammy skin, and pale face. A person who has suffered a shock should be made to lie down. To make him comfortable and warm, he should be covered with a blanket or additional clothes.\n<br>• Cuts All cuts should be washed with an antiseptic lotion and covered with a waterproof dressing. In case of considerable bleeding, it should be stopped as soon as possible by bandaging firmly or by pressing the artery with thumb. If bleeding doesn't stop, immediate medical assistance should be sought.\n<br>• Nose Bleeding Tn case of nose bleeding, the person should be asked to sit down with the head bent forward- His clothing should be loosened round the neck, chest, and waist. To stop the bleeding, apply pressure and pinch the nostrils closed for about five minutes. Nose bleeding occurs due to the rupture of the fine capillary of artery; applying pressure and keeping the nostril closed provides sufficient time for blood coagulation. If bleeding persists, seek medical assistance.\n<br>• Fainting A person may faint after standing for a long period in a hot, badly ventilated area. The symptoms include whiteness, giddiness, and sweating. The perv;n should be made to lie down and his legs should be raised slightly above the level of his head. when he regains consciousness, he should be kept in fresh air for a while and it should be ensured that he did not injure himself when he fainted.\n<br>• Fractures In case of a suspected fracture, the first step should be to remove any pressure from the affected part and to make it immobile. One should not try to realign the bone and seek immediate medical assistance. If there is bleeding, apply pressure to the wound with a sterile bandage or a clean cloth. To prevent swelling and to relieve pain till the medical assistance arrives, apply ice packs wrapped in a towel or a piece of cloth. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, he should be made to lie down,with the head slightly lower than the trunk, and, if possible, his legs should be elevated.\n<br>• Burns and Scalds Burn is caused by a dry heat source like flame or hot articles, whereas scalds are caused bv a wet heat source like steam or boiling liquids. The burnt part should be placed under running cold water or immersed in cold water till the pain ceases. If it's a major burn, seek the assistance of a doctor.\n<br>• Muscle Strain In case of a sprain, stop the activity that caused the injury and appJy ice to the injured area to reduce swelling. Use a bandage to restrict the movement of the injured area, and, if possible, elevate the injured part to make the fluids drain away.\n<br><br><b>HANDLING UNUSUAL EVENTS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS\n</b><br><b><br></b><br>Besides accidents and injuries, the hotel staff should be equipped to handle unusual events and emergency situations like:\n<br><br>• Terrorist activities and bomb threat\n<br>• Robbery and theft\n<br>• Drunken guests\n<br>\n<br>Terrorist Activities and Bomb Threat\n<br>In view of recent terrorist attacks in the top hotels of Mumbai, hotels have heightened their security levels for the safety of their guests and staff. It is a challenge for the hotel security staff to strike the right balance between being hospitable and being alert to the activities of the resident and non-resident guests. They also have to go in for extra security measures.\n<br>Hotels that cater to VIPs like cinestars, politicians, CEOs of key companies, etc. are potential targets of terrorist attacks and should be well equipped to handle terrorist threats. In case of a bomb threat, the hotel should liaise with the local police authorities and follow their instructions. If the bomb threat comes over the telephone, the person receiving such a call should follow the given procedure:\n<br><br>• Do not interrupt the caller.\n<br>• write down the exact words of the caller.\n<br>• If possible find out:\n<br>    1. The time by which the bomb is due to explode.\n<br>    2. The place where the device is placed.\n<br>    3. The description of the device.\n<br>    4. The motive of the attackers.\n<br>    5. The identity of the attackers.\n<br>• Write everything as soon as the call is disconnected. If available, a bomb threat form may be used. Try to note down the following:\n<br>    1. Caller's voice\n<br>    2. Mannerism\n<br>    3. Age and sex \n<br>    4. Accent\n<br>• Any background noise, etc.\n<br>• Do not alter the exact conversation between you and the caller while narrating the incident to the authorities.\n<br>• Inform the competent authority immediately.\n<br>• Do not spread any rumour.\n<br>• Do not attempt to defuse the bomb if you are able to locate the same. Contact the local police authority or bomb disposal squad for defusing the device.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Also, the valuables in the possession of guests may invite burglars. To discourage robbers, the guests should be asked to leave their valuables in the front office safety deposit locker or in the in-room locker. In the event of an armed robbery, the hotel employees should follow the below-mentioned procedure:\n<br>\n<br>• Comply with the robbers' demand.\n<br>• Do not make any sudden movement as it may provoke the robbers to use weapons or firearms.\n<br>• Remain quiet, unless directed to talk by the robbers.\n<br>• Do not attempt to disarm the robbers, as this may jeopardize many lives.\n<br>• The cashier may switch on the secret alarm that might be installed in the cash drawer, while also following the direction of robbers so that they do not get suspicious of him.\n<br>• Observe the robbers carefully, noting the physical characteristics like height, build, eye colour, hair colour, mannerisms, complexion, clothing, scar marks, or anything that can be helpful in their identification.\n<br>• Note the direction of escape, and the type and registration number of the vehicle used by the robbers.\n<br>• Do not touch any object that might have been touched by the robbers and restrict the movement of people in the area in order to preserve fingerprints and other possible evidence left by the robbers.\n<br>• Gather the details of the robbers from the people who have witnessed the event and record them in the crime report form, if available.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent the spread of disease-causing harmful microorganisms. Since cleaning process removes infections - microbes as well as dirt and soil, they are often the means to achieve hygiene. It is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion of health because of the risk of food poisoning. Kitchen Hygiene refers to maintaining the cleanliness of Kitchen equipment’s, surroundings and including personal hygiene.\n<br>\n<br><b>Sanitation\n</b><br>The word sanitation comes from the Latin word sanitas, which means “health”. Sanitation means creating and maintaining hygienic and healthful conditions. It is an applied science and relates physical, chemical, biological, and microbial principles to food, the environment and health. Sanitation is more than just cleanliness. Food or equipment can be free of visible dirt and still be contaminated with microorganisms or chemicals that can cause illness or food spoilage.\n<br>Sanitary practices and hygienic conditions are becoming more and more important because food is being processed, prepared and sold in larger volumes than before. Some microorganisms cause food spoilage and food-borne illness, but others are beneficial in food processing and preparation. Sanitation can reduce the growth of microorganisms on equipment and dirt on food. This can reduce contamination of food by microorganisms that cause food-borne illness and food spoilage. Sanitary principles also apply to waste disposal and can help reduce pollution and improve ecological balance.\n<br>\n<br><b>The benefits &amp; importance of a good sanitation program</b>\n<br>• Compliance with statutory regulations.\n<br>• Preventing food-borne illness outbreaks.\n<br>• Improving quality and shelf life of foods.\n<br>• Reducing energy and maintenance costs.\n<br>• Increasing quality and confidence.\n<br>• Improve the guest satisfactions\n<br>• Increase the revenue\n<br>\n<br><b>Kitchen Hygiene</b>\n<br>Kitchen hygiene is related to clean and maintain the surfaces and equipment of entire kitchen and very crucial part of total hygiene in the Food production areas. Carelessness in the cleanliness of any section of the kitchen could lead a risk of food poisoning. To make a kitchen safe and hygienic the following important points must be considered.\n<br>\n<br>• Kitchen floors should be cleaned (swept, mopped, scrub with detergent and rinse with hot and cold water) daily or each shift of operation if necessary.\n<br>• Ventilation should be thoroughly cleaned and wiped.\n<br>• Lighting's should be wiped with damp cloth.\n<br>• Walls, ceilings, doors, windows should be wiped and polished with right agents as per the routine.\n<br>• Put rubbish bins in appropriate locations and dispose of garbage frequently.\n<br>• Refrigerator, deep freezer, and cool rooms should be cleaned with lukewarm Soda water. Do not use soap or any other detergent powder.\n<br>• All kitchen (Kitchen appliances) manual and mechanical equipment should be cleaned with hot water such as food mixtures, miners, processors, slicers, grinder/ blender, etc.\n<br>• Still-rooms, working tables, cupboards and racks should be periodically cleaned.\n<br>• Chopping boards should be frequently cleaned and wiped.\n<br>• Kitchen store area must be checked and cleaned regularly.\n<br>\n<br><b>Food Hygiene\n</b><br>\n<br>Food hygiene is a scientific discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent food-borne illness. This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food can transmit disease from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Rules regarding food hygiene are:\n<br>\n<br>• Prevent contaminating food with pathogens spreading from people, pets, and pests.\n<br>• Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.\n<br>• Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill temperature.\n<br>• Coolers/ freezers and refrigerators should be cleaned frequently and store food at the proper temperature.\n<br>• Use safe water and raw materials\n<br>• Use clean and sharp blade knife and clean chopping board after each use.\n<br>• Labeling food to indicate when it was produced (or, as food manufacturers prefer, to indicate its “best before\" date).\n<br>• Equipment like spatulas, ladles, skewers, etc. are to be dipped into sanitize after each use.\n<br>• Food once cooked should be re-heated properly up to 70+* Celsius.\n<br>• Quick cooling of food is essential prior to the refrigeration or freezer.\n<br>\n<br><b>Personal hygiene for Food Handlers:\n</b><b><br></b><br>Personal hygiene can be defined as the study and practice of preventing illness or stopping it from spreading by keeping oneself clean. In Other words, personal hygiene refers to high Standard of personal cleanliness and appearance of the staff which is essential not only to prevent the spread of disease but also to win the respect of others because when we apply for a position in a hospitality industry, our appearance and cleanliness will be carefully noted.\n<br>Personal hygiene may be described as the principle of maintaining cleanliness and grooming of the external body. It is, in general, looking after yourself.\n<br>Employees who are ill should not come to work. They should not touch food or equipment and utensils used to process, prepare, and serve food. Food can carry several illnesses, including:\n<br>• Respiratory diseases, e.g., colds, sore throats, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis\n<br>• Gastrointestinal diseases, e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery\n<br>• Typhoid fever\n<br>• Infectious hepatitis\n<br>\n<br> Proper personal hygiene can be achieved by the following ways:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Bathing: </b>It is essential for all the food handlers to take a shower regularly and change undergarments daily, such as socks/stockings and briefs. Bathing not only removes visible dirt and germs but also helps eliminate body odour.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Hands:</b> Hands must be washed thoroughly and frequently with hot soapy water and dry hands with towels or under the dryer. Hand must be washed: -\n<br>• On entering food room and before handling food\n<br>• After going to the toilet\n<br>• After smoking\n<br>• After blowing nose\n<br>• After handling raw food\n<br>• After handling refuse\n<br>• After eating\n<br>• After using cleaning materials\n<br>\n<br><b>3.Fingernails: </b>Fingernails must be kept short.

Women's hair should be covered as much as possible. One should never scratch, comb or touch hair in the kitchen as germs could be transferred to the food via the hands or hair strand may fall in the food.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Nose: </b>The nose should not be touched when food is being handled. Avoid sneezing or coughing near food. Use a disposable tissue to wipe the nose.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Mouth:</b> Never touch the mouth or lips as germs in saliva pass from Fingers to food and table-tops. If food needs to be tasted during preparation, a clean spoon should be used and not the fingers or utensils used in preparation.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Ears:</b> The ear-holes should not be picked or scratched while in the kitchen as germs can be transferred into the food.\n<br>\n<br><b>8.

This article addresses the chemical contamination of foods, as opposed to microbiological contamination, which can be found under food borne illness.  Food can be contaminated or spoilt by any of the following sources and at any stage from the farm to the table till it is consumed. Sources of contamination of food include: \n<br>\n<br>Air, Water, Plant, Soil, Food handler, Machinery and Equipment, Sewage and Trucks or Carts during transport.\n<br>\n<br>Food contamination refers to the presence of harmful chemicals and microorganisms that can cause illness or injury in food when such food is consumed. Food contamination is a serious health problem that needs to be tackled. The effect of chemical contaminants on human health may sometimes be seen only after years of prolonged exposure at low levels, for example, carcinogens in food may build up in the body causing cancers. Unlike most microbiological agents, chemical contaminants present in food are not destroyed by thermal processing’s. Contaminants in food can be broadly classified into the following categories:<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Rodents urinate or leave their droppings behind which harbour several kinds of disease producing bacteria and are responsible for the spread of human diseases. Microorganisms such as bacteria yeasts and mold can enter food at any stage of processing from the farm to the table and contaminate it.\n<br>\n<br><b>Natural Toxins\n</b><br>Certain plants and animals may contain natural substances that are poisonous and may produce gastro-intestinal disturbances. Some may even prove fatal.\n<br>Naturally Occurring Toxicants in Plants\n<br>• Lathyrus Sativus or Kesaridal\n<br>• Soybeans\n<br>• Green Potatoes\n<br>• Argemone Seeds\n<br>• Mycotoxins\n<br>• Egrot\n<br>• Cereals &amp; Groundnuts\n<br>• Poisonous Mushrooms\n<br>\n<br><b>Sea Food Toxins\n</b><br>Mussels and Clams (Shellfish) Ocean mussels and clams may be poisonous during some periods of the year when they feed on small crustaceans who in turn have been feeding on dinoflagellates (single-celled organisms). These dinoflagellates are toxic algae that produce the heat stable toxin PSP (paralytic shellfish poison), which is extremely toxic to humans. Symptoms include itching, numbness of lips and tongue, muscular weakness and respiratory paralysis that can be fatal.\n<br>There are many natural toxins in foods, but most of these toxins cause toxicity only when consumed in excess. Small amounts of most of these may not be toxic; hence, toxins represent only minor hazards as compared to bacterial hazards\n<br>\n<br><b>Toxic Metals &amp; Chemicals\n</b><br>Metals, when consumed in excess of the requirements, could cause toxicity. These contaminants may be present in the environment and may accumulate during the different stages of food preparation. By the time food is ready to be consumed, it can reach levels that are toxic to humans. Some of the toxic metals are listed below.\n<br>• Selenium\n<br>• Zinc\n<br>• Lead\n<br>• Cadmium\n<br>• Cobalt\n<br>• Copper\n<br>• Tin\n<br>• Brass\n<br>• Fluoride\n<br>\n<br><b>Pesticide Residues\n</b><br>Pesticide spray residues may contaminate foods such as cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables. Pesticides may also get into foods through soil, water and air.\n<br>The improper application of pesticides like Aluminium phosphide or zinc oxide results in health hazards as these pesticides leave behind residues in the form of other compounds of aluminium or zinc metals. Other important chemicals are\n<br>\n<br>1. Arsenic\n<br>2. Barium\n<br>3. Mercury\n<br>\n<br><b>Presence of Extraneous Material\n</b><br>Contaminants present in food could be nail chippings, hair, stones, grit, dirt or other extraneous matter. Accidental contamination by metallic fragments and shards of glass may render food harmful. Some common metal fragments are stapler pins, flexible aluminium wire, metal curls and fine filings from canned food opened with a defective opener. Glass chips may enter food from broken glassware, or misuse of glass for taking out crushed ice.\n<br>Physical contaminants may be organic or inorganic. Organic contaminants include plant parts, debri, weeds, seeds, poisonous seeds of Dhatura, dead insects, excreta, uric acid, rodent hair, etc., while inorganic contaminants include lumps of earth, stones, dust, glass, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Processing &amp; Packaging Material\n</b><br>Most foodstuff available in the market today has been subjected to some form of processing and packaging. While processing and packaging may prolong the life of the product, the main purpose of packaging is to provide a physical barrier for contaminants. Processing and packaging contaminants are not present in raw food materials but are generated during the stages in processing like high temperature, fermentation, etc. Processing contaminants are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. Examples are nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and trans fat.\n<br>The level of these contaminants in processed foods can be minimised by regulating processes. Processing equipment’s may also contribute towards metal contamination through metal fragments from equipment’s like copper as well as lubricants, cleaning and sanitizing agents.  Although packaging materials help in keeping food free from contaminants, some are known to add contaminants to food. \n<br>\n<br>The chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA) used in plastic food containers and cans is known to leach from products and get absorbed in low concentrations by the human body and may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Phthalates are found in adhesives, cling films and some printing inks. They may be carcinogenic and are also linked to hormonal imbalances. Apples with little stickers stuck on them and any food wrapped in cling film could have been contaminated by phthalates. Small amounts of aluminium may pass onto food from cookware or packaging. Food contact materials should be checked for safety.\n<br>\n<br><b>Prevent Contamination\n</b><br>\n<br>Cross-contamination is the main reason for many food-borne illness outbreaks. Even if meat has been cooked correctly, meals can still become contaminated with pathogens if cross-contamination isn’t avoided in the preparation process.  Put simply, if raw foods come into contact with ready-to-eat foods, cross-contamination can occur.  \n<br>\n<br><b>Wash your hands\n</b><br>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water (warm or cold) and dry them:\n<br>• Before handling food\n<br>• After handling raw food – including meat, fish, eggs and vegetables\n<br>• After touching the bin, going to the toilet, blowing your nose or touching animals (including pets)\n<br>\n<br><b>Wash worktops, knives and utensils\n</b><br>Wash worktops, knives and utensils before and after preparing food, particularly after they've been touched by raw meat (including poultry), raw eggs, fish and vegetables.\n<br>\n<br><b>Use separate chopping boards\n</b><br>• Use a separate chopping board to prepare raw food, such as meat and fish.\n<br>• This is to avoid contaminating ready-to-eat foods with harmful bacteria that can be present in raw food before it has been cooked.\n<br>• Before reusing them, thoroughly clean and sanitise plates, utensils and cutting boards that have come into contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs.\n<br>• Chopping boards should be replaced if they are excessively scratched or damaged.\n<br>• Damaged chopping boards develop grooves that are hard to clean, making bacteria difficult to eliminate.\n<br>\n<br><b>Keep raw meat separate\n</b><br>• It's especially important to keep raw meat away from ready-to-eat foods, such as salad, fruit and bread.  \n<br>• This is because these foods will not be cooked before you eat them, so any bacteria that get onto the foods from the raw meat will not be killed. \n<br>• Store raw meat on the bottom shelf \n<br>• Always cover raw meat and store it on the bottom shelf of the fridge, where it cannot touch or drip onto other foods.\n<br>\n<br><b>Store Food in the Right Place\n</b><br>Where you store food plays a major role in preventing cross-contamination. When placing foods in the refrigerator, where and how foods are stored is incredibly important.\n<br>• Raw meats should always be stored on the bottom shelf. This eliminates the risk of juices dripping onto other foods and contaminating them.\n<br>• Raw meat, poultry and seafood should be stored in covered containers or sealed plastic bags to prevent their juices from dripping or leaking onto other foods.\n<br>• If you’re not planning on using meat within a few days of purchase, it should be placed in the freezer for defrosting at a later date.\n<br>• Meats and ready-to-eat foods should never be placed next to each other or on the same shelves.\n<br>\n<br><b>Food Safety Training\n</b><br>The best way to prevent cross-contamination, and the serious consequences it can cause, is to train your employees. Everyone who handles food in your business should have at least a basic knowledge of food-borne illness and food allergens, including:\n<br>• food-borne bacteria and what they need to thrive\n<br>• how food can become contaminated\n<br>• signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction\n<br>• the importance of good personal hygiene\n<br>• the importance of following food safety protocols and best practices\n<br>• the risks and consequences of cutting corners when it comes to food safety\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

To prevent food from spoilage or from causing illness, the following principles of proper food handling should be observed during purchasing, storage, preparation and service of food.\n<br>\n<br><b>Important Points to be Observed While Receiving &amp; Inspecting Deliveries\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Meat &amp; Poultry: This should be purchased from a plant which has an inspection certificate &amp; inspection mark on all products to be certain that only healthy animals have been slaughtered, and that the meat has been stored, handled and transported in a sanitary way.\n<br>2. Fish: All fish and shellfish should be from unpolluted water.\n<br>3. Eggs: Eggs must be at least grade B and should have clean intact shells.\n<br>4. Milk: Milk should be pasteurised and from an approved source.\n<br>5. Canned foods: Cans should be obtained from a plant having a licence. All cans should have the date of processing, code and licence number on it. When opening cans, always open the uncoded end.\n<br>6. Cereals and pulses: These should be checked for the presence of contaminants like presence of mud, stones, unwanted grains, mouldy grains and insects or insect droppings. Damaged and eaten grains or grains of uneven size should not be selected.\n<br>7. Fruits and vegetables: These should be checked for bruises and damage by insects. Only wholesome items at the correct stage of maturity should be purchased.\n<br>8. Spices, nuts and dry fruits: These should be checked carefully for insect contamination. All packets should be intact.\n<br>\n<br>Make sure food supplies are properly labelled. Discard any containers with missing labels.\n<br>Always select food of good quality and visit the suppliers occasionally to check on sanitary practices.\n<br>\n<br><b>FOOD STORAGE</b>\n<br>All catering establishments, irrespective of the volume of business handled, should have adequate, temperature-controlled storage facilities to protect food from any kind of spoilage. Temperature controlled storage facilities include a dry food store, refrigerated stores and deep freezers. Storage space required depends on quantity purchased.\n<br>These facilities will prevent the entry and multiplication of microorganisms and preserve the quality and palatability of food. Food will thus remain wholesome till it is consumed.\n<br>However, food cannot be completely free from microorganisms because of their ubiquitous nature. Complete sterilisation of food is therefore, neither practical nor necessary. What is needed is control over the duration and temperature of storage to prevent growth of microorganisms. This can be achieved by ensuring that food is not left in warm and moist places for indefinite periods of time. The golden rule for storing any kind of food is to keep it clean, covered, cool and whenever applicable, dry.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The three major storage areas to hold large stocks or for bulk supplies are:\n</i></b><br>\n<br>1. the dry food store for non-perishables (short-term holding) 10 to 21C\n<br>2. the refrigerated store for perishables (short-term holding) 1 to 4C\n<br>3. the freezer stores for perishables (long-term holding) —6 to —25C\n<br>\n<br>The stores should ideally be located in the north-east part of the building. This will prevent it from getting heated by the sun and will help in keeping it cool and well lit. It should be near the goods receiving area. The kind of storage facilities and amount of storage space required depends on many factors like the menu, the number of covers served daily, purchasing policies and frequency of deliveries.\n<br>The stores should not be humid or damp and should be pest proof.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>General Guidelines for Food Storage</i></b>\n<br>1. Wash items that need washing and prepare food for storage. Wipe cans.\n<br>2. Check frozen items to ensure that they are in a solidly frozen state before putting them in the freezer.\n<br>3. Rotate food supplies using the 'first-in, first-out' (FIFO) method. Goods should be placed in the order received. Date goods on receipt and place new deliveries in the rear of the store. The 'Best before' or 'Use by' date should be marked on products.\n<br>4. Store foods in areas designed for storage only and not in the kitchen and larder. Each storage area should be separate.\n<br>5. Keep all goods in clean wrappers or containers. Dirty wrappers attract pests and contaminate food. Use waterproof and airtight material. Check packets before storing them.\n<br>6. Keep storage areas clean and maintain a regular cleaning schedule.\n<br>7. Keep vehicles used for transporting food within the establishment clean.\n<br>8. Access to the food store should be restricted to prevent pilferage and to control stocks.\n<br>9. Periodic inspection and turnover of foods is necessary to check their condition,\n<br>10. Maintain appropriate temperature depending on the type of storage,\n<br>11. Avoid overcrowding of stored food and overstocking. Adequate air circulation and ventilation is necessary.\n<br>12. Food should be stored in the appropriate storage area to remain in a sound state, for example, if bananas are refrigerated, their skin darkens and they become unacceptable.\n<br>13. Food should be used as soon as possible because even under ideal conditions of storage there is loss in nutritive value, flavour and freshness.\n<br>14. Goods must be stored as soon as they are purchased. Potentially hazardous food items should not be left in the open yard or receiving area. They should be refrigerated or frozen immediately.\n<br>15. Separate areas should be made available for storage of equipment, cleaning materials and empty cartons/ packaging materials.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE DRY FOOD STORE\n</b><br>The dry food store should be airy, well lit, clean, protected from pests and from excessive moisture. All foods that do not spoil at room temperature are stored here, for example, whole cereal grains, pulses, flour, sugar, jaggery, oil, hydrogenated fat, canned foods and some fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, mangoes, roots and tubers, pumpkins and preserves like jams, jellies, papads and pickle.\n<br>The temperature in the store should range from 15 to 21C (60 to 70F). Ideal temperature for maximum shelf life of commodities is 10C (50F) and a relative humidity of 50 to 60 per cent.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE REFRIGERATED STORE\n</b><br>The term ‘refrigerated store' includes the domestic refrigerator, the reach-in refrigerator, the walk-in chiller, the cold room and refrigerated display cabinets.\n<br>Storage of foods at refrigeration temperatures retards bacterial growth but cannot undo any damage already done.\n<br>Perishable foods like raw meat, poultry, fresh fish, stocks, soups, gravies, milk and milk products, ground masala pastes, cooked cereals and some fruits and vegetables can be held for short periods in the refrigerator. The cabinet temperature should not exceed 4C.\n<br>The temperature range is normally one to 4C in this store. The double door refrigerator with a separate deep freezer has a wider temperature range of —18 to 5C. It has the advantage of maintaining a steady temperature because the number of times the refrigerator door is opened is reduced as there is a separate door for the freezer. This keeps frozen foods fresh for a longer time with minimum temperature fluctuations in the freezer. Nowadays, three or four- door refrigerators are also available to store perishable items separately. The advantage of having three or four separate cabinets for food storage is a wider temperature range, lesser chances of cross-contamination and absorption of odours, and a steady temperature.\n<br>The deep freezer of the domestic refrigerator has the lowest temperature and the crisper has the highest temperature. Bacteria, yeasts and molds grow more slowly at refrigerator temperatures as compared to room temperature, so although foods will spoil when they are refrigerated, the rate of deterioration is much slower because generation time is longer.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The maximum storage time in the refrigerator at ideal refrigeration temperature for some perishable foods\n</i></b><br>\n<br>Shellfish    1 day\n<br>Raw fish    2 days\n<br>Minced meat    1-3 days\n<br>Cooked fish    3 days\n<br>Poultry     2-3 days\n<br>Eggs     14 days\n<br>Meat     3—5 days\n<br>Milk     3-7 days\n<br>Curds     5-15 days \n<br>Paneer     5 days \n<br>Cream cheese     2 weeks \n<br>Processed cheese (open)     3-4 weeks\n<br>Cream     3 days  \n<br>Egg white     3 days \n<br>Egg yolk     3 days\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Ideal refrigeration temperature for specific foods\n</i></b><br>\n<br>Fish     -1  to 1 C\n<br>Meat and poultry     0 to 2C\n<br>Dairy products     3 to 4C\n<br>Fruits and vegetables     4 to 7C\n<br>\n<br>The temperature of the refrigerator should be checked regularly by placing a thermometer in the warmest part of the refrigeration unit. If temperatures below 50C are not maintained, it needs to be checked. The likely reasons for this inadequate cooling could be:\n<br>\n<br>1. opening the refrigerator door very often\n<br>2. leaving the door open for long\n<br>3. placing hot foods in the refrigerator\n<br>\n<br>The refrigerator should be cleaned inside out. Cleaning should coincide with defrosting. The time for cleaning should also coincide with the time when the refrigerator is relatively empty. This makes the task easier and minimises chances of contamination of food. All shelves and trays should be removed and washed in a warm soda solution, dried and replaced.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chillers\n</b><br>Chillers are necessary in large catering establishments to reduce the temperature of large portions of food to 15C or lower in a short time of 1 1/2 hours. Once chilled, the food can be promptly refrigerated. The walk-in chilling room contains a refrigeration unit and a fan to circulate cold air.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE FREEZER STORE\n</b><br>The term 'freezer store' includes the commercial deep freezing cabinets, walk-in freezers, open top display freezers, blast freezers and the frozen food storage compartment of the domestic refrigerator.\n<br>The freezer store is used for preserving food for longer periods than the refrigerator, the temperature being so low that food turns into ice and is maintained in that state. This preserves the colour and flavour of food better than the refrigerator, especially if the food is blast frozen.\n<br>Most bacteria can survive the freezing process and remain dormant for many months or years in frozen foods. Only fresh, high quality food should be frozen because freezing cannot improve the quality of contaminated food. When frozen food is thawed and the temperatures reach the danger zone, the dormant bacteria start multiplying rapidly. Therefore, food should be thawed properly before being cooked.\n<br>Foods to be stored in the deep freezer should be at room temperature and wrapped in moisture-proof material to prevent dehydration and to keep odour and contaminants away. The wrapping should be airtight. All packets should be labelled and dated before being frozen.\n<br>\n<br>The temperature of the deep freezer varies from —6 to —25C or lower, as in the case of blast freezers. In blast freezers, it may be lower than —35C.\n<br>The function of some freezers, like the frozen food storage compartment of the refrigerator, is to hold already frozen foods.\n<br>The true freezer is capable of freezing fresh food and at the same time maintaining the temperature of the already frozen food kept in the freezer. The temperature range is -18 to -25C (0 to -15 F) and at these temperatures foods can be stored from one to 12 months, depending on the nature of the food. Such freezers have four-star rating.\n<br>A star rating system has been prepared on the basis of the temperature in a freezer or frozen food compartment of the domestic refrigerator.\n<br>\n<br><b>Blast Freezing\n</b><br>This is a method of rapid deep freezing of packed cooked or uncooked foods by a continuous blast of cold air in a tunnel or chamber at temperatures as low as -40C. Because of the very rapid method of freezing, the quality of the product, i.e., its freshness is preserved. Quick freezing produces very tiny ice crystals in food which do not damage the cells. Once frozen, food should be stored at -20 to -30C.\n<br>Slow freezing forms large ice crystals which damage the cells and cause cell juices to drain out.\n<br>This results in loss of flavour, colour and nutrients,\n<br>The freezer is used to store raw meat, fish, poultry, pork, vegetables like green peas, fruit and fruit pulp, ice cream, etc.\n<br>Nowadays, frost-free refrigeration units are becoming popular as they do not require defrosting and can maintain the temperature at —20 to (0 —60 F), Horizontal, vertical and table top models are popularly used in catering establishments like hotels, restaurant« and industrial canteens, ice-cream parlours and fast food centres.\n<br>\n<br><b>STORAGE OF SPECIFIC FOODS\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Meat and meat products should be refrigerated soon after delivery at zero to 2C (32 to 36F). This temperature minimises and controls bacterial growth if meat is contaminated. Raw meat should be wrapped loosely for better air circulation. Cooked meat should be wrapped tightly. Frozen meats should be wrapped and sealed in moisture-proof paper or containers to prevent freezer burn. Cooked and raw meat should be stored separately. Larger cuts of meat should be hung in the cold room and nothing should be stored below. Trays which collect blood drippings should be washed regularly (once a day).\n<br>\n<br>2. Poultry is more perishable than meat and should be stored at zero to 2C. Whole dressed birds may be loosely wrapped in wax paper or aluminium foil and refrigerated for three days. Frozen poultry is stored at a temperature of -18C and should be cooked soon after thawing. It should be used within six months after processing.\n<br>\n<br>3. Eggs should be stored at 4 to 7 c (39 to 45 F). Always refrigerate eggs. Eggs stored in the refrigerator can stay fresh for two weeks as against three days at room temperature.\n<br>They should be stored with larger end up. At 20 C, eggs may be stored for 9-10 months. Treatment with pure, colourless, odourless mineral oil increases shelf life by several months. 4. Seafood should be stored at 0C (32F). Fresh fish covered with ice may be stored for three days. Crushed ice should be used as larger pieces bruise the flesh and enhance spoilage. If kept at  0C without ice, then fish should be used within 24 hours.\n<br>\n<br>5. Dairy products include milk, evaporated and condensed milks, butter, cheese, cream, etc. They readily absorb odours and should be kept away from strong smelling foods.\n<br>(a) Fresh milk should be stored in the cold room or refrigerator. Tops and sides of bottles and packets should be washed before storing. Lids of milk urns should be replaced after drawing the required stock. Milk kept at room temperature should not be poured back into refrigerated cartons. Milk should be stored at 3 to 40C for five to seven days.\n<br>(b) Milk powder should be stored at 10 to 21 C and can be stored up to one year if not opened. It should be refrigerated after opening.\n<br>(c) Butter and other fats (margarine) should be stored at 3 to 4C for two weeks.\n<br>\n<br>6. Vegetables should be stored at a temperature of 4 to 7C. Onions and potatoes should be stored in ventilated containers in a cool, dry, dark place. Potatoes and other root vegetables should be stored in sacks if purchased in bulk. As vegetables respire, they require ventilated storage. They should be stored on wire racks adequately above ground level. Cabbage and leafy vegetables should be used as soon as they are received or else emptied on the racks and refrigerated. They should be checked thoroughly if they are to be held for a day or two.\n<br>\n<br><b>Danger Zone\n</b><br>The food handler should always remember that food cannot be stored indefinitely as all food will ultimately spoil.\n<br>Bacteria are present everywhere. Even if one is careful and all attempts are made to prevent contamination, some bacteria will still find their way into food and contaminate it. It is therefore necessary to prevent multiplication and contamination at every step of food preparation with the help of appropriate time-temperature control.\n<br>Bacteria multiply over a wide range of temperature. The range of 5 to 63C (41 to 145F) is called the \"danger zone\" because the hazard of bacterial growth is great within this range. The golden rule of food protection is called time until it is ready to be served and temperature principle. It requires that all potentially hazardous food be kept at an internal temperature below 50C (41 F) or at an internal temperature above 630C (145F) during display and service. If, during periods of preparation, potentially hazardous or high risk foods must be exposed to temperatures between 5 to 63C, this exposure time must be kept to an absolute minimum. The longest period for which food may safely remain in this zone is four hours, but food should not be in the 15 to 490C range for longer than two hours.\n<br>\n<br><b>Recommended Food Storage Temperatures</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The purpose of serving delicious, nutritious meals prepared and served under hygienic conditions is totally lost if the water served along with it is contaminated. If safe drinking water is not available for consumption, it results in ill health.\n<br>Water meant for human consumption should be safe, clear and wholesome. Such water is referred to as potable water. It can be defined as water which is free from pathogenic agents, harmful chemical substances, odour and unpleasant taste &amp; suspended particles and which can be used for domestic purposes.\n<br>\n<br><b>CONTAMINATION OF WATER\n</b><br>The growth rate of most microorganisms slows down in pure water and they eventually die although spores may survive for months or years in water. Pathogens and viruses do not multiply in pure water. Water which has been freshly contaminated, or possesses a continuous Source of pathogens, is very harmful to health. Natural waters have a capacity to assimilate and transport waste. But these days, heavy water pollution has made self-purification a difficult process.\n<br>\n<br>Water can get contaminated:\n<br>1. at the source itself\n<br>2. by the addition of impurities during transit from source to reservoir\n<br>3. during distribution, through lead pipes conveying water or through cracks and joints in the piping. Water pipes should always be at a safe distance from sewage and gas pipes\n<br>4. when water is stored in underground or overhead storage tanks, barrels or containers\n<br>5. when innumerable or unclean containers are dipped in the water container\n<br>6. during service, if unclean ('lasses are used to serve water or by faulty methods of holding the glass\n<br>\n<br>Unpotable water can contaminate dishes, vegetables, etc. washed with it or ice made from contaminated water may render cold drinks harmful to health.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hardness of Water\n</b><br>Water is considered soft if it forms a lather with soap which lasts for at least five minutes. Water is considered hard when soap does not lather easily in it. This hardness is caused mainly by compounds of calcium and magnesium dissolved in it.\n<br>Hardness in water is further classified as carbonate and non-carbonate hardness. Carbonate hardness was earlier called temporary hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate. Non-carbonate hardness was earlier referred to as permanent hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium sulfates, chlorides and nitrates. Iron' manganese and aluminium compounds also cause hardness.\n<br>\n<br>Water is termed soft or hard depending on the level of hardness. Hardness in water is expressed in terms of milliequivalents per litre (mEq/I). One mEq/l of hardness producing ion is equal to 50 mg calcium carbonate (50 ppm) in one litre of water.\n<br>\n<br>In the hospitality industry, the type of water used directly affects food service, preparation, dishwashing, laundry and the maintenance departments,\n<br>Water used for consumption should be moderately hard. However, if hardness exceeds 3 mEq/l then softening of water is recommended because:\n<br>\n<br>1. the quantity of soap and detergent needed is greater in hard water\n<br>2. the colour and appearance of food is preserved in soft water\n<br>3. the carbonates in water precipitate out when water is heated and cause furring or scaling in boilers. This reduces their efficiency, increases fuel consumption and may sometimes cause boiler explosions.\n<br>4. the life of pipes and fixtures is shortened as they may rust\n<br>5. fabrics washed with soap in hard water wear out faster— they turn grey in colour and lose their texture.\n<br>6. when soluble soap is added to hard water a sticky insoluble curd is formed which gets deposited on bathtubs, buckets, etc. and is difficult to rinse off.\n<br>\n<br><b>Removal of Hardness <i>(For more detail ref. Facility Management)\n</i></b><br>Hard water can be softened by boiling, addition of lime or addition of sodium carbonate, the base exchange process and by demineralising it.\n<br>\n<br>1. Boiling is done to soften water on a small scale. Boiling removes temporary hardness of water. Carbon dioxide is expelled in this process and the insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO)3)2 ---Heat---&gt; CaCo3 + H2O + Co2 ↑\n<br>\n<br>2.Addition of lime removes temporary hardness of water and can be used for softening water on a larger scale. The insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out and the carbon dioxide formed is absorbed by lime.\n<br>In Clark's method of softening water, for each degree of hardness, one ounce (approx. 30 g) of quicklime is added to every 700 gallons of water.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(OH)2 + Ca(HCO3)2 ---&gt; (2CaCO3) + 2H2O\n<br>\n<br>3. Addition of sodium carbonate or soda ash removes both temporary and permanent hardness.\n<br>\n<br>Temporary hardness:\n<br>Na2Co3 + Ca(HCO3)2 ----&gt; 2NaHCO3 + CaCO3\n<br>\n<br>Permanent hardness\n<br>Na2Co3 +CaSO4 ----&gt; CaCO3 + NaSO4\n<br>\n<br>4. In the ion exchange process or zeolite process, hard water is passed through a tower which is packed with zeolite or ion exchange material. The sodium cations in the zeolite are exchanged for the calcium and magnesium ions in water and water is softened. The process continues till all sodium ions are used up and water is totally soft.\n<br>\n<br>The ion exchange material should be flushed at intervals with a concentrated solution of sodium chloride to replace the sodium that has been lost. The calcium and magnesium chloride that is formed is washed away. The soft water produced is remixed with a part of hard water to achieve the desired level of hardness.\n<br>Water softening units are fitted into the main water system near the point where water enters the premises.\n<br>\n<br>5. In the demineralising process, hard water is passed through a bed of synthetic demineralising resin. Softening of water is carried out in two steps.\n<br>    A. In the first step the hydrogen ions in the resin combine with the chloride, carbonate and sulphate ions and converts them into their respective acids, i.e., hydrochloric, carbonic and sulphuric acid.\n<br>    B. In the second step the acids formed are absorbed by the demineralising resin and pure soft water is obtained. This process is used to soften sea water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Impurities\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Natural pollutants\n<br>(a) suspended impurities like clay, silt, sand and mud\n<br>(b) dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and ammonia\n<br>(c) dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium salts, lead\n<br>(d) microscopic plants and animals\n<br>\n<br>2. Artificial pollutants\n<br>(a) sewage which contains decomposable organic matter and pathogenic agents\n<br>(b) industrial wastes, for example, toxic agents including metals, salts and complex organic chemicals\n<br>(c) agricultural pollutants, pesticides and fertilisers\n<br>(d) physical pollutants, for example, radioactive substances\n<br>\n<br><b>HAZARDS OF WATER POLLUTION\n</b><br>The health of an individual is affected by the consumption or use of contaminated water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Biological Hazards\n</b><br>Water-borne diseases can be caused by ineffective agents that could be present in the water, for example,\n<br>1. viruses: viral hepatitis and poliomyelitis\n<br>2. bacteria: cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis, infantile diarrhoea\n<br>3. protozoa: amoebiasis, giardiasis\n<br>4. helminthic infective organisms, for example, ova of roundworm, whipworm and threadworm\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical Hazards\n</b><br>These include pollutants derived from industrial and agricultural wastes, for example, detergents, heavy metals, solvents, minerals, organic acids, nitrogenous substances and other toxic compounds.\n<br>\n<br><b>PURIFICATION</b>\n<br>Naturally occurring water is seldom sparkling clear, free from bacteria or without any odour or objectionable taste. It needs to be purified before use. Impure water may be purified by either of the following methods:\n<br>\n<br>1. Natural method: (a) impounding or storage, (b) oxidation and settlement\n<br>2. Artificial method: (a) physical: distillation, boiling, (b) chemical: precipitation, disinfection or sterilisation, (c) filtration: slow sand filtration, rapid mechanical filtration, domestic filtration. Water may be purified at two levels: large-scale purification and small-scale purification.\n<br>\n<br><b>CRITERIA FOR JUDGING WATER QUALITY\n</b><br>\n<br>For hygienic purposes the examination of water is generally done along the following lines:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Physical Qualities\n</b><br>(a) Turbidity is measured on the Jackson candle turbidity meter. It should be less than five units.\n<br>(b) Colour is measured in a colorimeter and should be less than five units.\n<br>(c) It should have no disagreeable odour.\n<br>(d) It should be palatable and free from disagreeable taste.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Chemical Qualities\n</b><br>(a) Chlorides: maximum permissible limit is 600 mg/l but the standard is 200 mg/l of water.\n<br>(b) Hardness: total hardness should not exceed 300 mg/l water.\n<br>(c) Free and saline ammonia should not exceed 0.05 mg/ l.\n<br>(d) Albuminoid ammonia is a measure of decomposable organic matter that is to be oxidised. It should not exceed 0.1 mg/ l.\n<br>(e) Nitrites should be zero.\n<br>(f) Nitrates should not exceed 1 mg/l. It indicates old contamination.\n<br>(g) The amount of oxygen absorbed is an approximate test for the amount of organic matter present. Oxygen absorbed at 37o c in three hours should not be more than 1 mg/ l.\n<br>(h) Dissolved oxygen should not be less than 5 mg/ l.\n<br>(i) Toxic substances like arsenic, selenium, cadmium, lead and mercury should not exceed the prescribed limits.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Bacteriological Qualities or Indicators: </b>It is based on organisms indicating faecal contamination. (a) Coliform organisms include all aerobic, facultative and anaerobic gram negative, non-sporing, motile and non-motile bacteria capable of fermenting lactose at 35 to 37C in less than 48 hours. This group includes the faecal group (example, E. coli) and non-faecal group (example, Klebsiella aerogenes).\n<br>\n<br>The bacteriological quality of water is assessed on the basis of the coliform test. Water samples are collected in screw capped sterilised bottles. The test measures the most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria in 100 ml of water.\n<br>\n<br><b>WATER QUALITY STANDARDS\n</b><br>The WHO International Standards, 1971, relate five water quality variables:\n<br>\n<br>1. Microbial pollutants: standards for bacterial quality of treated water are\n<br>(a) throughout any year, 95 per cent of the samples should not contain any coliform organisms in 100 ml of water\n<br>(b) no sample should contain E. coli in 100 ml of water\n<br>(c) no sample should contain more than 10 coliform organisms in 100 ml water\n<br>(d) coliform organisms should not be detectable in 100 ml of any two consecutive samples of water\n<br>\n<br>2. Toxic substances: arsenic not more than 0.05 mg/l, cadmium not more than 0.005 mg/ l, lead not more than 0.05 mg/ l, mercury not more than 0.001 mg/ l, selenium not more than 0.01 mg/l.\n<br>\n<br>3. Specific substances that may affect health, like fluoride levels, should vary between 0.5 to 0.8 mg/ l.\n<br>\n<br>4. Characteristics affecting acceptability: the acceptability of water is affected by substances that cause discolouration, odour, taste, dissolved salts and affect the pH. All these should be within desirable limits set by the WHO.\n<br>\n<br>5. Radioactive substances: pollution of water by radioactive substances is on the rise and the WHO has set standards for acceptable limits.\n<br>\n<br><b>SEWAGE AND CONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY\n</b><br>\n<br>Sewage consists of human faecal matter diluted with water and other waste waters from the kitchen sinks and drains, dishwashers, laundry, wash basins, bathroom drains and waste waters from mopping, washing floors and garbage bins. It is approximately 99 per cent water and contains a large number of microorganisms, mainly bacteria from the intestinal tract and soil. Sewage contamination is harmful as it is a potential source of human pathogens, especially those that affect the intestinal tract. Persons who suffer from acute intestinal disorders excrete millions of virulent pathogens into sewage. Healthy people and carriers also contribute significantly to this microbial load. Sewage contamination can result in severe, widespread epidemics of communicable diseases. It can contaminate both food and water.\n<br>\n<br>Food gets contaminated when untreated sewage is used as a fertiliser in fields where vegetables are grown. Root vegetables, green leafy vegetables, salad vegetables, coriander leaves, celery and parsley are at a greater risk. This risk increases further when vegetables are not washed well, not peeled or are consumed raw in salads or as garnish. Coriander leaves used in green chutney has been responsible for the outbreak of several food-borne illnesses.\n<br>When untreated sewage is discharged into a body of water, the pathogens present contaminate the water and the food found in such waters. Improperly treated or untreated sewage spoils water because of the large number of microorganisms and high percentage of organic matter present in sewage. The microorganisms in sewage oxidise the organic matter. For the process of oxidation, oxygen from water is used up and the level of dissolved oxygen is reduced. Normally, water contains 7-8 ppm of free oxygen. This level promotes and maintains all forms of aquatic life.\n<br>When the level of oxygen falls to 3 ppm, anaerobic conditions develop which do not favour aquatic life. Fish cannot survive in low levels of oxygen and they either leave or die. Foul smelling products are produced by putrefaction and fermentation brought about by anaerobic microorganisms. This spoils the water and makes it cloudy, malodorous and unfit for human use.\n<br>\n<br>The drinking water supply in cities and towns may get contaminated with sewage in many ways. Sewage contamination may occur through a leak in pipes or water from sewage disposal tanks may seep into the soil and contaminate other sources of water.\n<br>A leak in sewer connections and improper plumbing in the food service establishment may be the cause of contamination of otherwise clean, and wholesome food and potable water.\n<br>\n<br>If water supply is inadequate or a water carriage sewage disposal system is not available —which may be the case in temporary food service establishments, at fairs or at remote tourist spots — some type of sanitary conveniences is necessary. They should be located well away from the kitchen and should have hand washing facilities. Various types of water closets may be used, like the chemical closet. It should have a cover and should be kept as clean as possible. These problems may also arise in villages, isolated buildings and small remote catering establishments.\n<br>Water samples should be sent for testing to the nearest public health laboratory before using water for consumption. Water can be purified by boiling and should be stored in clean containers and kept covered.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A cleaning schedule for all areas and departments should be planned to maintain clean surroundings.  \n<br>\n<br><b>CLEANING AND SANITISING\n</b><br>Before we discuss the procedures it is important to understand the difference between cleaning and sanitising.\n<br>• Cleaning is the removal of matter from a surface on which it is not acceptable. For effective cleaning, soiled surface should be in contact with a cleaning agent for adequate time and sufficient pressure should be applied if required, to remove the soil. Cleaning involves two steps: a wash step and a rinse step.\n<br>• Sanitising is a reduction in the number of diseases causing bacteria to safe levels. This is achieved through the use of heat or the application of chemical compounds. It involves one step only, a sanitise step.\n<br>\n<br><b>NECESSITY FOR AN EFFICIENT CLEANING PROGRAMME\n</b><br>Both cleaning and sanitising form the basis of food service sanitation.\n<br>The main purpose of cleaning and sanitising dishes is to remove visible surface dirt and reduce the number of bacteria to a safe level so as to\n<br>• reduce health hazards by avoiding contamination\n<br>• prevent spoilage of food\n<br>• control odour\n<br>• create a pleasing appearance\n<br>\n<br>Before any cleaning programme is implemented, it is necessary that all food service workers understand the importance of cleaning procedures. It is the duty of every employee to ascertain that all dishes and utensils used in the catering establishment are clean. Dishes are handled by various people like waiters, cooks and dishwashers. Dishes cleaned and sanitised by dishwashers may be mishandled and contaminated after washing. They may collect dust or get covered with a greasy film if they are not stored or handled properly.\n<br>An act of carelessness on part of one person, can cancel the painstaking efforts of others and result in wastage of costly detergents, money invested in machines, labour, etc.\n<br>It is important to note that no matter how well food is prepared and served, it is unacceptable if served in improperly cleaned dishes or accompanied by unclean crockery or cutlery, which retains the smell or remanent of the food served in it earlier.\n<br>Cleaning removes visible soil, sanitising reduces microbial load to a safe level.\n<br>All utensils, equipment, tableware and other food contact surfaces used in the food service operation must be cleaned and sanitised after every major use or at least once a day. Any utensil or equipment used in the storage, preparation and service of food and which touches the food directly, is a food contact surface. Pots, pans, dishes, glasses, cutlery, trays, mixer bowls, slicing machines, chopping boards, work platforms and stainless steel table tops are food contact surfaces which do not touch the food directly are non-food contact surfaces like the top of the refrigerator, the bottom of work platforms and tables, floors, etc. These surfaces need to be cleaned regularly and sanitised occasionally.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cleaning Agents\n</b><br>Water alone is not sufficient to remove dirt, grease or stains from food contact surfaces. For effective cleaning certain cleaning agents should be used. Cleaning agents include all materials that are required to effectively clean surfaces, dishes, utensils, equipment and machines in the kitchen. They include soaps, detergents and other chemical substances such as sanitisers and disinfectants. Cleaning tools like scrubbers, steel wool, brushes, etc., aid in the action of the cleaning agent.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Dish washing is one of the most important tasks in any food service establishment. Unfortunately, it is one of the most neglected areas. The job is usually assigned to the lowest grade of employees who are inexperienced, unskilled and do not understand the importance of using the right amount of detergent, water or time for this work. It is the responsibility of the management to select correct methods of dish washing and train employees accordingly.\n<br>Whether clearing dishes or cleaning premises, there has been a gradual perceptible shift from manual cleaning to mechanised cleaning machines. Dish washing machines have the following advantages and disadvantages.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Advantages\n</i></b><br>1. They can clean faster.\n<br>2. Lessen day to day financial expenditure.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. Initial investment is high.\n<br>2. Trained personnel are required.\n<br>\n<br>Both manual as well as machine cleaning have their own advantages and disadvantages and a wise facilities manager will weigh the pros and cons of both before taking a decision.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The method to be used will depend on many factors, such as the surface to be cleaned and the size and nature of the food service establishment.\n<br>Even if all dishes are machine washed, workers should be trained in manual methods as well. All methods listed above follow three basic steps, namely, wash, rinse and sanitise. All these steps are necessary for proper cleaning and sanitising.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Three Bucket Method\n</b><br>This method is used to clean and sanitise equipment which is too large to place in a sink or dishwashing machine or is stationary. Three separate buckets, containing a wash, rinse and a sanitising solution, are required. All buckets should have different colours.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedure for the Three Bucket Method\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Wash : Remove food scraps from the surface to be cleaned. In the first bucket, mix detergent in warm water. Scrub surface with a scourer to loosen food, grease and dirt.\n<br>2. Rinse: Take clean warm water in the second bucket. Wipe the surface with a sponge to remove loosened soil and detergent till surface is clean. If surface does not look and feel clean, repeat these two steps.\n<br>3. Sanitise: Add chlorine in the correct concentration to warm water in the third bucket. With a clean sponge, wipe the entire surface lightly and allow solution to air dry. Do not dry surface with a dishcloth. Large equipment is sanitised by rinsing carefully with boiling water, or live steam from a hose in case of equipment in which steam can be confined.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Sink Method\n</b><br>\n<br>Dishes, pots, pans, chopping boards, containers, knives, spoons and other small utensils are washed and sanitised in sinks. Sinks should ideally have three compartments so that washing, rinsing and sanitising can be done in separate sinks. A one or two compartment sink is not very hygienic as all steps are carried out in the same sink.\n<br>\n<br><b>Equipment required\n</b><br>\n<br><b>1. Sinks: </b>Three compartments with a hot and cold water supply are required. The sinks should be large enough to hold washing baskets and allow dishes to immerse completely in wash solution. They should be made of a non-toxic, non-corrosive, smooth material like stainless steel or vitreous enamel. Galvanised iron sinks are recommended for washing large pots and pans. The sink should have an overflow pipe to remove excess water. The pipe should be fitted with a strainer and funnel to remove food residue and prevent clogging.\n<br>There should be a slope near the drain for self-draining. The number of sinks required depends on the number and variety of meals served. Separate sinks should be used for crockery and cutlery and for pan washing.\n<br>Waste pipe traps should be removable, smooth, easy to clean and easily fitted. Plastic, which is acid and hot water resistant, is preferred. A spray hose fitted to the sink is a desirable feature to wash down the sink and the draining boards.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Drains: </b>They should be 10 to 15 cms (four to six inches) in diameter to remove all waste water without the risk of flooding. Grease traps should be cleaned regularly. \n<br>\n<br><b>3. Ware tables and drain boards: </b>They are necessary to hold soiled dishes before washing and to hold clean dishes after washing. They should be large enough, self-draining and should be so placed that they do not interfere with washing procedures.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Ware washing baskets:</b> They are used for immersing soiled ware in the rinse and sanitising compartments. They should have long handles and be large enough to handle the normal load of wares. They should ensure complete immersion of items and prevent contamination of cleaned and sanitised items by human hands.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Booster heaters: </b>They should supply hot water between 74 to 82c for sanitisation. They should ideally be located under the final rinse sink to prevent water temperature from dropping.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Thermometers:</b> They are meant for dishwashing and should be portable and accurate to within 20C.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Clock:</b> It is necessary to check immersion time during sanitisation and the clock should have a seconds hand.\n<br>\n<br><b>8.Cleaning tools:</b> Bristle brushes, scourers and abrasive pads in a good state of repair should be placed in a convenient place. Sponges should be avoided as they encourage the growth of microorganisms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedures for three Sink method\n</b><br>\n<br>Check that sink is properly clean before starting work.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Scrape and pre-rinse:</b> This is to remove loose soil from dishes and keep wash water cleaner and free from bacterial build-up. A scraper or squeegee is used and food residue is transferred to a garbage container. Sometimes, soaking may be necessary to remove more stubborn residues.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Washing:</b> The first sink contains a hot detergent solution at 43.5 C to 52C. Dishes are washed in this sink with the help of cleaning tools. All visible soil is removed from the surface of dishes. As more and more articles are washed, the effectiveness of the detergent is reduced. The detergent solution is no longer effective when a scum or grease layer forms on water and should be changed. Brushes and scourers should be cleaned, sanitised and dried' Grease is removed at 52 C.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Rinsing:</b> The second sink contains water at till washing solution other materials is removed and dishes are clean and touch. Rinse water should be changed when it becomes dirty. If a basket is used, dip entire basket all traces of detergent are removed. A basket must be used sanitise dishes because (a) it reduces hand contact with eating surfaces of and (b) temperature of water needed for sanitation is too high for the use of hands.\n<br>\n<br><b>4.Sanitising:</b> This step removes any soil and microorganism that remain after rinsing and has a bacteriostatic Sanitisers used may be chemicals or water at specific temperature and pressure. The concentration and duration of immersion should be strictly followed.\n<br>\n<br><b>5.Drying: </b>No item should be touched on the food or mouth contact surface. All items should be air dried to retain effects of sanitation. They can be left in the baskets to dry. Glasses should be inverted on a well ventilated drain board. Towel or dish cloth drying is not recommended.\n<br>\n<br><b>Mechanical Dishwashing\n</b><br>A dishwashing machine is used to clean and sanitise all plates, glasses, cups, saucers, knives, forks and spoons which are used in the dining area. Other equipment and utensils that fit in the machine can also be cleaned and sanitised.\n<br>The machines work automatically and are extremely useful where quantity food preparation and service takes place, as both time and labour are saved. For effective cleaning, it is necessary to follow the manufacturer's operating instructions carefully and to maintain the equipment in good working condition.\n<br>\n<br>Before selecting a machine it is essential to have the following details\n<br>• type of ware\n<br>• volume of dishes to be washed\n<br>• type of food service establishment\n<br>• space available for dishwashing\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of dishwashing machines\n</b><br>\n<br>Dishwashing machines are basically of two types:\n<br>• stationary machines\n<br>• conveyor machines.\n<br>\n<br><b>Stationary machines: </b>These machines have a single tank. The articles to be washed are suitably placed in the rack and the racks are lifted and placed in the machine. The rack Of dishes stays in one place while the wash and rinse solution circulates around the dishes. The timing is automatically controlled in most machines.\n<br>\n<br><b>Conveyor machines: </b>In the conveyor machine, the dishes move on a conveyor belt through the different cycles of washing, rinsing and sanitising. The dishes are either placed in racks on the conveyor belt or directly on the pegged conveyor belt.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Conveyor machines may have</i></b>\n<br>• a single tank where dishes are cleaned by the wash solution at one end and conveyed to the clean end of the machine where it activates fresh water at 82C (180F). Water is sprayed from nozzles above and below the dishes.\n<br>•  two tanks or multiple tanks: the first tank, i.e. the wash tank, contains the detergent solution. After the wash cycle, the rack is conveyed through the power rinse tank to rinse the dishes free of most of the detergent solution. The rack then passes through the final rinse for sanitisation. The racks are transported through the machine on a pre timed conveyor at a speed set by the manufacturer. These machines are recommended for larger establishments.\n<br>Loading of dishes may be done from the top or side of the machine, depending on the model. Dishes are cleaned in a machine either by a jet or spray of hot water and detergent, forcefully sprayed to remove soil; by revolving brushes that scrub soil off the dishes; or by mechanically agitating the detergent solution to help in removing soil.\n<br>\n<br>Steps in dishwashing Before beginning the cleaning operation, it is essential that the machine, dish tables and work area is clean. Some preliminary steps which should be checked are:\n<br>\n<br>•  Check the insides of the machine to ensure that no food soil, broken dishes or other foreign objects are present.\n<br>•  Overflow pipes should be free of debris.\n<br>• Spray arms should be clean and properly installed.\n<br>•  Inspect final rinse nozzles and see that they are not blocked.\n<br>• Make sure sufficient detergent is present in the dispensers.\n<br>•  Keep scrap bins and strainers in place.\n<br>\n<br><b>Operating procedure</b>\n<br>The following steps should be adhered to for successful cleaning:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Sorting: </b>Set aside any dishes that require special handling, as well as heavily stained dishes which will not get cleaned by the routine cleaning process in the machine.\n<br><br><b>2. Preliminary scraping and pre-rinsing:</b> Remove excessive loose food particles with the help of a rubber scraper. The purpose of scraping is\n<br>•  to prevent the clogging of spray nozzles with food particles\n<br>• to avoid frequent changes of wash water\n<br>•  to reduce bacterial contamination of wash water\n<br>•   to remove as much grease as possible prior to washing\n<br>•  to wet the soil remaining on the dishes\n<br>•  to facilitate easy cleaning\n<br>Manual pre-rinsing is not required if the machine has a power pre-rinse attached.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Soaking: </b>This may be necessary for dishes on which soil has hardened or dried, especially flatware may need soaking for some time to loosen the soil. Soaking can be done in tubs placed under the counters or ware tables.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Racking: </b>In this step, the dishes are arranged either in racks for conveyance through the machine or on a pegged conveyor for travel through it. It involves proper placement of dishes to permit the wash and rinse solution to come in contact with all surfaces to be cleaned.\n<br>\n<br>Cleaning is most effective and breakages are reduced to a minimum when\n<br>a) there is no overcrowding of dishes\n<br>b) similar sized objects are racked together\n<br>c) cups and glasses and other deep dishes are placed open end down to prevent water accumulation\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Washing:</b> The purpose of washing is to remove all food soil from the dishes and dissolve the grease on dishware. This requires clean water, with correct proportion of detergent at the right temperature and pressure, in contact with the dishes for the proper amount of time. The detergent solution circulates at a specific rate as the dishes pass through this tank. The temperature of the washing solution will vary according to the type of the machine and its specifications.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Power rinse: </b>It completely removes most of the detergent-laden water and permits effective sanitisation. Because of the build-up of heat, it hastens the drying process. Hot pumped rinse water is sprayed over the dishes in the correct volume and with sufficient pressure to rinse\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Final rinse and sanitisation:</b> At this stage, any remaining detergent is removed and the dishes are sanitised. If water is used as a sanitiser, then it should be sprayed in adequate volumes and at a correct pressure with temperatures varying between 77 and 82C. Ideally, as it leaves the nozzles it should have a temperature of 82C. However, it should not exceed 90 to 930C, as the water at that temperature under pressure would atomise and become vapour.\n<br>\n<br>The hotter the water used for sanitising, the faster the drying and lesser chances of water spotting. A drying agent may be injected in this cycle.\n<br>If chemical sanitisers are used, dishes should be immersed for at least one minute at concentrations mentioned in below image\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Drying: </b>Crockery and utensils must be left in racks to drain and air dry.\n<br>\n<br>Although dishwashing machines are a boon to us, they can create problems if not selected well. Some of the common causes of failure are:\n<br>• machines located in the wrong place\n<br>• improper plumbing\n<br>•  machines are too small\n<br>•  untrained employees\n<br>• water is not adequately hot\n<br>•  water pressure is low\n<br>• wrong selection of detergent\n<br>\n<br><b>While selecting a new machine the following points should be kept in mind:\n</b><br>•  select a machine from a reliable, standard company\n<br>•  two small machines are better than one big one. During slack periods only one machine can be operated, or if one machine breaks down, the other can be used\n<br>•  number of operators required and the kind of technical knowledge they must possess to operate the machine\n<br>•  whether servicing the machines needs outside technicians or can it be serviced by available staff\n<br>•  the power consumption\n<br>•  clean-ability and durability of the material used and the design\n<br>•  whether the machine is silent or noisy when switched on\n<br>•  whether large trays and glasses can be washed in it\n<br>•  whether it has a detergent feeder fitted in\n<br>• whether there is a strainer pan to collect food debris<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Contamination of cleaned and sanitised ware should be avoided.\n<br>\n<br><b>General Rules for Hygienic Storage and Handling\n</b><br>• There should be clean place for storage of cleaned and sanitised ware. Store all items either on clean dry shelves or in cart racks. Dusty or dirty shelves will quickly re soil cleaned and sanitised items.\n<br>•  Handle items as little as possible, taking care not to touch food or mouth contact surfaces.\n<br>•  Storage area must be dry and above the floor. Splashes from mopping solutions or food spillage, exposure to dust or floor dirt from sweeping must be avoided.\n<br>•  Pans or containers stored on low shelves should be placed inverted or covered.\n<br>•  Utensils etc. should be hung in a self-draining position on hooks or racks.\n<br>•  Glasses and cups should be inverted on racks or on shelves.\n<br>•  Silverware should be placed in perforated plastic containers to dry. Cutlery should be picked up by the handle.\n<br>\n<br><b>DISH CLOTH\n</b><br>Drying cloths should be used only when necessary. They should be changed frequently and washed and boiled each day. The dish cloths themselves carry many germs and the wise operator will realise that the germs may be passed back onto cleaned and sanitised crockery and utensils. The use of disposable absorbent paper for final drying can be considered, if affordable. Cloths for mopping should, if used, be boiled frequently or soaked overnight in a disinfectant solution.\n<br>\n<br><b>CLEANING OF PREMISES &amp; SURROUNDINGS\n</b><br>\n<br><b>The Cleaning Schedule\n</b><br>Cleanliness is an essential part of the daily routine in all areas and departments in any catering establishment. It is the key to good health and efficient work. The cleaning schedule should be carefully planned so that the premises, all equipment, furniture and surroundings are thoroughly cleaned every day.\n<br>The cleaning schedule should not interfere with or hamper the regular working in the establishment.\n<br>The cleaners should be familiar with the work programme and should strictly adhere to the time-table. Any spillage or accidental mess should, however, be cleaned up promptly. This will prevent accidents and grease spots forming on floors.\n<br>\n<br>A surface is clean when it is free from dust, dirt, grease, stains, cobwebs or any such unacceptable element.\n<br>To remove soil from any surface it is necessary to select the proper cleaning technique. This will depend on the type of soil present. Soil can be removed by\n<br>•  Sweeping.\n<br>•  Dusting or damp dusting with a cloth tightly wrung in a multipurpose cleaning solution.\n<br>•  Washing with water and a cleaning agent.\n<br>•  Friction using an abrasive agent.\n<br>•  Suction using a vacuum cleaner or wet pick-up machine.\n<br>•  Pressure using a scrubber or polisher.\n<br>•  Force by using water or air.\n<br>•  Solvents for removing grease and stubborn stains.\n<br>\n<br>The cleaning schedule should be prepared for daily, weekly and monthly cleaning. Special cleaning, like outside windows, light fixtures, walls which require washing, polishing, distempering and painting of surfaces, is carried out a couple of times a year. The general rule for cleaning is that there should be no large-scale sweeping and cleaning while food is being prepared, as sweeping raises dust laden with microbes which contaminates food.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Floors\n</b><br>Floors in areas where traffic is heavy, as in kitchens, bakeries, pantries, dish washing rooms, walk-in refrigerators, corridors, dining rooms, washrooms and toilets, should be cleaned everyday. Floors in areas where traffic is light can be cleaned weekly.\n<br>All washable floor surfaces should be washed. Wooden floors should be waxed or polished. Hot water, soap or detergent, a scrubbing brush and a mop is needed. Before cleaning the floor all movable light equipment and furniture must be shifted. The floor is best washed at the end of the day. Floors in the pantry, larder, dry food store and vegetable store should be swept daily and washed at least once a week. Fixed carpets and matting in dining rooms, passages, stair ways should be brushed or swept every working day, preferably by a vacuum cleaner. Loose mats and rugs should be vacuum cleaned or taken out into the open and beaten at least once a week. Carpets should be shampooed or dry-cleaned at least once a year.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Walls and Ceilings\n</b><br>Walls and ceilings should preferably be non-porous and in good repair. This helps the cleaning procedure and prevents pests from breeding in cracks and crevices. While cleaning the walls and ceiling, follow the principle of cleaning the uppermost areas first. Walls, ceilings and fixtures should be cleaned at least once a week. Areas within reach should be dusted every day. The method of cleaning will depend on the surface to be cleaned. Ideally, walls should be washed with warm water and a detergent. The ceilings should be brushed and swept. The girders, piping, electric fittings, etc., should be dusted. Dusting should be done carefully so that dirt is not shifted from one place to another. The best way of removing dust is by using a vacuum cleaner or by damp dusting as it prevents dust from flying about. All walls must be dusted. Walls that become heavily soiled or spattered daily should be washed. All walls should be free of dust, moisture, grease, cobwebs, grime and mildew. Light coloured walls make dirt more visible. Painted walls should be repainted regularly and papered walls should be kept in a good state of repair with no loose paper.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Kitchen Tables, Counters and Preparation Slabs\n</b><br>Kitchen tables, counters and preparation slabs should be washed at least once a day. All surfaces coming in contact with food should be cleaned after each service by the three bucket method. All metal surfaces should be cleaned with hot water, a non-scratching detergent and by a hand swab. Wooden and marble surfaces should be scrubbed with a scrubbing brush, hot water and detergent. The surfaces should be rinsed well and wiped with a clean cloth every time they are used. Such cloths should be washed well and boiled.\n<br>They should not be used for wiping dishes. All parts of tables, including the framework and underside, all areas of the counter, like the hot cupboard, and all preparation areas including chopping boards and pastry slabs should be cleaned at least once a day. The bain-marie (hot food serving counter) should be turned off and the water drained off. It should then be cleaned inside and outside with hot detergent water, rinsed and dried every day.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Shelves and Cupboards\n</b><br>Selves and cupboards that are constantly in use should be tidied and cleaned once a week. Shelves and cupboards are mainly used for storing ingredients or utensils. They should be first emptied and then swept or dusted. The upper surfaces of the shelves should be scrubbed and lower surfaces should be dusted. While cleaning, always start with the topmost shelf. Cupboards which are used for storing reserve crockery, linen, etc. i.e. long-term storage cupboards, should be cleared out and cleaned at least once a month.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Cleaning of Surroundings and Drainage\n</b><br>The entire working premises should be thoroughly cleaned once a week. This should be done after the dining area is closed. All edible items should be covered and put away. All easily movable articles should be removed. This procedure helps in putting things back in place and prevents accumulation of rubbish. Cleaning is thus made easier.\n<br>All furniture should be thoroughly dusted at least once a day and table tops scrubbed clean. If table cloths are used, they should be changed. Walls, ceilings, fittings and fixtures should be swept or dusted at least once a week.\n<br>All passages and staircases, whether used to carry food or used by customers, should be cleaned frequently, and any spillage should be mopped up at once. All nooks and corners should be swept out and cleaned thoroughly once a month.\n<br>Any open space outside the building should be swept and washed every day. No rubbish should be allowed to collect in the drains or else drains will get blocked, give off foul odours and encourage pests.\n<br>\n<br><b>Drainage</b>\n<br>Drains should be adequate to remove all wastewater without being overloaded. Each drain should have a water seal or trap which will prevent unpleasant odours rising from the pipe into the room. Drain pipes should have a diameter of 10 to 15 cms and should be cleaned regularly. They get blocked mostly because food accumulates on the sides and blocks the pipes. Blockages can be cleared by using a rubber water plunger. If not cleared then the cleaning eye at the bottom should be opened. The drain can be cleaned with a flexible wire or a cleaning liquid especially available for blocked drains.\n<br>Grease traps are necessary because they prevent grease from congealing in the drainpipes &amp; STP. The grease tray should be removed regularly and washed out.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

With the advancement of science, there is now a better understanding of the various sanitary practices, chemical treatment and better facilities are available to enable effective pest control. A vigilant food service worker can play an important role in protecting food from contamination and wastage and in maintaining the reputation of the catering establishment.\n<br>\n<br><b>IMPORTANCE OF PEST CONTROL</b>\n<br>\n<br>1. Contamination Contamination of food leading to food poisoning and other serious diseases in humans, is a major hazard of a pest infestation. This is so because pests move from dirt to food and transfer harmful microorganisms to it.\n<br>\n<br>2. Legal Requirement According to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (1954), if any food article consists either wholly or in part of any filthy, putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal or vegetable substance or is insect infested or is otherwise unfit for human consumption it is deemed to be adulterated. Serving adulterated food is punishable by law.\n<br>\n<br>3. Wastage and Destruction Ten per cent of the world's harvested cereals are destroyed by rodents and insects, which if saved could feed 260 million people. Rodents are known to destroy pipes, insulation and cables. Termites and textile pests cause grave damage to the woodwork and upholstery. Beetles, weevils and warehouse moths destroy commodities, making them unfit for consumption. Rodents contaminate much more food with their hair and droppings than they actually eat.\n<br>\n<br>4. Reputation The reputation of any catering establishment depends largely on the prevailing hygienic conditions. Flies hovering over uncovered food and insect body parts and droppings found in food can be very repulsive to the consumer, thus damaging the establishment's reputation. Hence, proper sanitary practices and pest control measures would go a long way in building up goodwill among customers and in turn will improve financial gains.\n<br>\n<br><b>CLASSIFICATION OF PESTS\n</b><br>Pests commonly found in a catering facility can be divided into the following categories:\n<br>* Insects which include houseflies, fruit flies, cockroaches, silverfish, firebrats and stored grain insects.\n<br>* Rodents which include rats and mice; and animals and birds which include cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Housefly\n</b><br>The housefly is one of the filthiest of pests and is found all over the world. It has a hairy body, three pairs of legs, each having a pad with glandular hairs. Secretions from these pads enable dirt and germs to stick to it, which is later transferred to food, equipment or any other surface it lands on.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>1. Environmental sanitation can be achieved by proper disposal of garbage, decaying food and animal carcasses and other wastes.\n<br>2. All food wastes should be held in tightly covered bins and preferably refrigerated to reduce decay and fly activity. Clean garbage containers thoroughly.\n<br>3. Protective display of food using fly proof cupboards, wire gauze covers, etc., should be practised.\n<br>4. Adequate fly proofing of doors and windows of kitchens and food service areas helps prevent their access to food. Self-closing doors and windows prevent their entry.\n<br>5. Air currents or curtains protect the establishment from the entry of insects and dust. They are mounted outside and above the door.\n<br>6. Various insecticidal sprays, aerosols and pellets are effective in controlling fly populations in kitchens and food service areas.\n<br>7. Poisonous baits and fly strips are a combination of an insect-attracting food like sugar and an insecticide. Since they are poisonous, they should be used and stored with care. They are recommended for outdoor use.\n<br>8. Swatting with fly swatters is not recommended in preparation, storage or service areas. Swatters are contaminated and spread dead insects and their body parts when they are used\n<br>9. Insect Light Traps (ILTs) - All species of flies are naturally attracted to UV-A light. This property is made use of in attracting and trapping flies\n<br>10. The flying insect catcher also attracts insects by emitting UV-A light but traps them onto two glue boards; one placed at the back of the trap and a second at the bottom of the trap.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Fruit Fly\n</b><br>These are seasonal, coloured and smaller than the housefly. They are most attracted to overripe and decaying fruit. These pests are not attracted to sewage and other wastes, hence transmit less number of microorganisms.Their larvae eat their way through different fruits and spoil them\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>1. Check fruit supplies for signs of infestation.\n<br>2. Get rid of decaying fruit and other fermenting foodstuffs.\n<br>3. Use screens, wire meshes and air currents to prevent their entry.\n<br>4. Electric fly traps, to a certain extent, are useful in exterminating them.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Cockroaches\n</b><br>The cockroach is another resilient pest known to man. It is filthy and gives off a foul odour. Cockroaches contaminate unprotected food, utensils and other surfaces. They travel from sewers to garbage dumps. En-route, they collect numerous disease-causing microorganisms on their bodies and in their stomachs. Uncontrolled cockroach infestations could spread diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid fever, intestinal worms and food poisoning.\n<br>\n<br>Control Measures\n<br>1. Persistent efforts at maintaining good sanitary conditions is the key to cockroach control. Covering dustbins at night, keeping food service areas free from dirt and food particles as well as prompt garbage disposal are essential.\n<br>2. All cracks and crevices should be properly sealed.\n<br>3. Good lighting and ventilation prove to be a deterrent to pests favouring dark, damp places to rest and breed.\n<br>4. Protect food from contamination by proper storage. Scrutinising bags and sacks for insect eggs and body parts, helps check the entry of these pests into the premises.\n<br>5. Permitted insecticides should be applied to cracks and crevices, undersides of tables, cupboards, equipment, behind sinks and other areas likely to harbour these pests.\n<br>6. Cockroach traps should be installed over drains. over a drain\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Ants\n</b><br>These common but annoying pests are known to mechanically transmit diseases from excrement to food. Ants cause immense wastage of food by eating some of it, thus making the food unfit for human consumption. They are known to destroy crops and also eat into wrappers.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures</b>\n<br>1. Good sanitary practices should be followed.\n<br>2. Food should be kept covered.\n<br>3. Suitable pesticides should be applied.\n<br><br><b>5. Stored Grain Insects\n</b><br>Some of the insects in this group include: flour beetle, rice weevil, granary weevil, the Indian-meal moth, saw-toothed grain beetle, lesser grain borer and angoumois grain moth.\n<br>These insects are like beetles with a long snout. They attack and destroy stored grains. The female grain weevil punctures the grain with her snout and lays an egg in each hole. The grub or larva burrows into the grain and eats away a part of the grain. They cause heavy losses and damage to the quality of the grain.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures</b>\n<br>1. All food items should be properly inspected before entering the storage area, for weevils, larvae, webbing or agglutinated grains and damaged packaging.\n<br>2. Thorough cleaning and drying of all containers before storing fresh food articles is necessary.\n<br>3. Discard contaminated food.\n<br>4. The rule first-in-first-out should be followed for all commodities.\n<br>5. There should be good ventilation, ensuring that storage areas are kept dry and cool.\n<br>6. Insect-proofing of bags: a solution containing insecticides is sprayed on the outer surface of the gunny bags in which grains are stored. This remains effective for six to eight months.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Rodents\n</b><br>It is mainly the rats and mice belonging to this group that trouble human kind. Equipped with a pair of sharp, chisel-like teeth, they gnaw into plastic, cardboard and other thin food containers. Rats are voracious eaters and are known to destroy food grains and standing crops. They devour eggs, attack poultry and their burrowing habit causes structural damage to buildings.\n<br>\n<br><b>Rodent infestation can be detected by:\n</b><br>1. Odours which emanate from their urine.\n<br>2. Marks left behind from gnawing and their claws. Their presence can also be ascertained by their foot marks in spilt flour, dust, etc.\n<br>3. Sounds they make while eating and scurrying about. Their presence during the day is a sign of a heavy infestation, as they are otherwise sensitive to light and prefer to come out in the dark.\n<br>4. The 'runs' are runaway marks they make from their breeding places to the source of food and water. These pathways are dark and greasy due to the grease found on the rodent's body. Finding these trails helps in placing baits and traps near the breeding places.\n<br>5. Excrement in the form of droppings are a sure sign of their presence. In fact, the size of the droppings helps determine a rat or a mice infestation.\n<br>The rat stool is larger (20 mm or 3/4 inch) than the mouse stool (6 mm or 1/4 inch). Fresh shiny stools confirm their presence in the establishment.\n<br>6. Burrows which are seen in places surrounding the building, like fences, spaces in the foundation and pathways, also indicate their presence. t!\n<br>7. The presence of rodent carcasses is an indication of a prevailing rodent menace.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>Effective rodent-control is possible only if the food handler is made aware of all the steps involved and the sequence in which prevention and elimination should be carried out.\n<br>\n<br>1. Deny entry: Rodents gain entry through open drains, doors, windows, ventilators, openings around water pipes, sewers, by burrowing around weak construction points and faults in the foundation.\n<br>\n<br>2. Deny breeding space: Store rooms and kitchens provide perfect sanctuaries for rats and mice. Rodent's preferences for dark, dirty, undisturbed places would imply that ample lighting, good housekeeping and high standards of tidiness could get rid of their breeding areas.\n<br>\n<br>3. Making the environment less attractive to rodents: This can be achieved by protecting the food supply using wire meshing and by keeping sacks of flour off the floor and away from the wall. Floors and work surfaces should be properly cleaned to remove dust, scraps of food, crumbs and wastewater, in order to cut off the food and water supply to rodents.\n<br>\n<br>4. Trapping: using traps is an effective method of eliminating a rat population. Using a number of traps, locating their 'runways' and placing two traps in opposing directions and at an angle of 900 to the wall to catch them moving to and from their nests, ensures the trapping of maximum number of pests.\n<br>\n<br>5. Poisoning: after ascertaining the rodent’s food preferences by 'pre-baiting', prepared baits should be placed along walls in runaways. Depending on how severe the infestation is, a number of baits should be used at regular intervals. Covering these bait stations with metal or cardboard covers prevents them from getting accidentally mixed up with food and also gives a sense of security to the 'suspicious' rodents. Once the baits are in place, all other sources of food and water should be inaccessible to these pests. Using gloves while handling baits and thorough washing of hands after the operation should not be neglected.\n<br>\n<br><b>Other Pests\n</b><br>Animals and birds, whether pets or stray, should not be allowed to enter an area where food is prepared, stored or served. Cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons may present problems for the catering establishment.\n<br>Domestic animals are carriers of ticks and mites and enteric pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonellae. Like humans, Staphylococci are found on the skin and nose of dogs and cats. Their presence is indicated by their droppings and signs of rubbish strewn around garbage bins.\n<br>Birds carry mites and many harmful microorganisms. They peck at food and damage packages. The presence of bird droppings and loose feathers in or near food is obnoxious. They can be controlled by\n<br>\n<br>• installing screens on windows, doors and ventilators\n<br>• discouraging the entry of animals in the premises\n<br>• discouraging the practice of feeding leftovers to animals in the premises proper storage and disposal of garbage\n<br>\n<br><b>Green Pest Management (GPM)\n</b><br>GPM is a pest control strategy using organic or plant based materials or materials of natural origin. It is an extension of integrated pest management and is looked upon as an eco-friendly pest management system. sometimes non-organic substances are also used in GPM if they are non-toxic and do not have a polluting effect on the environment, for example, insect bait stations that have synthetic active ingredients may be termed green. This is because the process of applying the product is also important in GPM.\n<br>\n<br>GPM is a proactive mode of controlling pests unlike conventional pest control that focuses on use of pesticides. Exclusion of pests, environmental changes and physical trapping are some of the non-pesticide measures used. GPM is considered to be the most advanced form of IPM and includes continuous training of technicians on common pests, inspection or identification of pests, latest developments in pest control measures, understanding its habits and biology, diagnosing and correcting pest friendly conditions, effect use of new products and sealants, proper inspection of the building and rectifying inlets.\n<br>GPM strategies work with a long-term vision and finding more permanent solutions to pest control while minimising the use of toxic pesticides and educating the public that green products are not necessarily very costly, but are beneficial in the long run.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Wastes arising from catering establishments are broadly classified into three groups: solid wastes (garbage and refuse), liquid wastes (sewage) and gaseous wastes (smoke and fumes).\n<br>Solid wastes in the form of refuse and garbage is the major waste which arises from the catering industry. They pose a problem in disposal to the caterer. Liquid wastes are normally disposed through sewers provided by the municipality in towns and cities and gaseous wastes are expelled into the atmosphere where they get diluted by diffusion and air currents. It is essential to collect and dispose of all types of waste separately as they are easier to deal with if they are kept separate.\n<br>\n<br><b>SOLID WASTES</b>\n<br>\n<br>Apart from the usual trash and litter like empty cartons, tins and boxes, solid wastes from the food industry include agricultural wastes like unusable portions of plant and animal foods resulting from food production. Solid wastes should preferably be sorted into biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes, and stored separately. They may be compacted or concentrated before disposal. Agricultural wastes can be used as feed or fertiliser after appropriate treatment.\n<br>Refuse refers to any waste material, either non-food or swill. Non-food waste from the kitchen includes all cans, bottles, paper bags, polythene bags, lids, cardboard cartons, etc. From the service area, single service items, paper napkins and straws, toothpicks, etc. also contribute significantly to the overall solid waste matter.\n<br>\n<br>If waste is allowed to accumulate it is dangerous to health. This is because of the following reasons:\n<br>1. Organic portions of solid waste ferments and gives off foul odours\n<br>2. Piled up waste favours the breeding of insects and rodents, especially flies\n<br>3. Pathogens present in waste may be conveyed to humans through pests and dust.\n<br>4. It may pollute the water supply.\n<br>5. There is a risk of air pollution in case of accidental or spontaneous combustion of rotting refuse because of the production of gas.\n<br>6. Hogs, cattle and dogs feed on garbage and spread it still further.\n<br>7. Heaps of refuse lying around is an unattractive sight.\n<br>\n<br>It is therefore necessary that the refuse from catering establishments is properly collected, stored and disposed of in a sanitary manner. If it is not disposed of immediately, then it should be stored in proper containers in a cool place. Garbage should always be kept well away from food, utensils and food preparation, storage and service areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Collection\n</b><br>Refuse should always be collected from the place where it is produced, i.e. near pre-preparation tables, meat blocks, kitchen sinks, dishwashing area, pantry table, etc. It can be collected in small bins or swill bowls. Nowadays, modern work tables are fitted with garbage bins on a trolley placed underneath the table. The waste can be immediately pushed off the table into the bin.\n<br>All small bins must be emptied into a large bin outside the kitchen at least twice a day or whenever the bins are full.\n<br>\n<br><b>Storage of Garbage\n</b><br>It is important to store garbage correctly before it is disposed of. It should not be left overnight near the kitchen area. The kitchen area is warmer than the other areas and decay is faster near the kitchen. The ideal storage area is in a yard behind the premises. Garbage should be filled in bins and these bins should be kept in the coolest place. Care should be taken to ensure easy cleaning and absence of pests. The garbage storage area should be large enough for the amount of garbage that will accumulate.\n<br>In large establishments and places where it is not disposed off frequently, it is stored in the basement at low temperatures.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Garbage Bin\n</b><br>The garbage bin should have the following characteristics:\n<br>1. it should be made of metal, preferably galvanised\n<br>2. stoutly constructed and durable\n<br>3. painted or treated with bitumen to prevent rusting\n<br>4. unridged\n<br>5. covered with tightly fitting lids, preferably with a clip to prevent the lid from blowing off.\n<br>6. leakproof\n<br>7. pestproof\n<br>8. easy to clean\n<br>9. of the correct size\n<br>10. adequate in number\n<br>\n<br>Cleaning the Bins Garbage bins may be used in rotation. They should be cleaned often. A tap, a pipe and a drain should be provided near the disposal area. After the bins are emptied they should ideally be rinsed with warm water and scrubbed with a long handled brush using soap and disinfectant. The floors of the disposal area should be clean and free from any spilt refuse.\n<br>Kitchen waste and plate scrapings should be collected in closed containers or a strong polythene bag or disposable cartons. To check pilferage, transparent bags may be used.\n<br>After the bag is full, it should be tied up.\n<br>These can be directly emptied into or placed in the main bins at regular intervals. This waste should never be carried through the dining areas. The containers should always be covered and cleaned thoroughly as soon as they are empty.\n<br>\n<br><b>Methods of Disposal\n</b><br>After refuse is collected, it is important to dispose it off in such a way that it does not create any nuisance.\n<br>The variety and quantity of waste products to be disposed off has increased tremendously with improvement in the standard of living and the population explosion.\n<br>Waste arising from catering establishments is mainly composed of biodegradable or organic matter (biomass). This waste needs prompt disposal because it is highly perishable and decomposes rapidly, giving rise to foul odours and encouraging the growth of microorganisms and pests.\n<br>Before selecting a method for proper disposal of wastes, it is necessary to understand the value of the waste matter which is to be disposed off and the nuisance it is likely to cause if improperly disposed.\n<br>\n<br>The methods of disposing garbage may be broadly classified as follows.\n<br>Land-filling, burial, composting, incineration, mechanically disposing, bio gas plants, vermiculture and recycling.\n<br>\n<br><b>Land filling\n</b><br>Dumping Refuse is dumped in low lying land or in land depressions like pits and hollows for reclaiming low lying land. This is the easiest method of disposing of dry refuse. Bacterial action reduces the volume of the refuse and gradually converts it to humus. This method however, has the following disadvantages:\n<br>1. loose refuse may be dispersed by wind\n<br>2. garbage is exposed to flies and rodents\n<br>3. it is unsightly in appearance and produces an unpleasant smell\n<br>4. surface water as well as ground water may get polluted\n<br>\n<br><b>Burial </b>This method is suitable where the volume of garbage produced is small. A trench is prepared to collect the garbage. At the end of the day the refuse is covered with 20 to 30 cm of earth. Alternate layers of refuse and earth are formed. When the trench is filled up till it is only 40 cm deep, it is filled with earth and sealed. A new trench is then dug. Chemical, bacteriological and physical changes occur in the buried refuse. It takes approximately four to six months for complete decomposition of organic matter into an innocuous mass. Temporary food service establishments set up in open areas should dispose of garbage by this method.\n<br>\n<br><b>Composting </b>This is a method of combined disposal of refuse and sludge. Sludge is the solid precipitate in the sewage tank which settles at the bottom.\n<br>Animal and plant wastes are rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can be returned to the soil by composting. Wastes of biological origin contain high amounts of water and are digested anaerobically by microorganisms in the absence of air. The waste is decomposed and stabilised by bacteria and fungi to form a humus like material called compost. Compost is rich in nutrients and fertilises the soil.\n<br>During this breakdown carbon dioxide, water and heat are produced. The heat produced is over 600C for several days. This destroys larvae and eggs of flies and other pathogenic organisms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Incineration</b> It is a hygienic method involving burning of refuse and converting it into harmless waste. It is burned in a specially constructed incinerator. The incinerator should be maintained in perfect working condition.\n<br>The incinerator should have a tall chimney and sufficient draught of air for efficient combustion, without creating a smoke nuisance.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages</b>\n<br>1. If refuse does not burn properly, too much offensive smoke is produced which, in turn, pollutes the air.\n<br>2. Organic nitrogen which could have been returned to the soil is converted into inorganic nitrogen and is returned to the atmosphere.\n<br>3. This method cannot be used during the rainy season or if the refuse is wet.\n<br>4. Although incineration is ideal from the sanitary point of view, it is costly compared to other methods and the fuel and fertiliser value of the waste is lost.\n<br>\n<br>Any presence of fine ash makes burning difficult and therefore dust or ash should be stored separately. In this method no manure is formed.\n<br>The volume of refuse is reduced to one-fourth its original weight. The residue is a mass of hard material called clinkers and is used for road making. The cost of transporting refuse is minimised. This is one of the best methods of garbage disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Mechanical Disposers</b>\n<br>Mechanical disposers include pulpers or disintegrators and mechanical compactors.\n<br>These can be installed in catering establishments and are useful because they help in reducing the volume of garbage and the number of garbage bins required. These methods require access to a drain, water for cleaning and a power source.\n<br>Pulpers or disintegrators The latest way of disposing kitchen waste as soon as it is produced is through an automatic garbage disposal machine. This is also the quickest and most hygienic way of garbage disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disposal of Biodegradable Wastes\n</b><br>Bacteria act on organic matter and decompose it either aerobically or anaerobically. In aerobic decomposition complete combustion of organic matter takes place. This happens in vermiculture.\n<br>In anaerobic decomposition incomplete combustion takes place and is accompanied with the production of methane gas. If anaerobic conditions are created in garbage heaps, ponds or septic tanks, a foul odour emanates because of gas formation. This principle is made use of in the production of biogas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Vermiculture\n</b><br>Vermiculture is a cheap, practical, innovative technology which conserves the humus content of the soil. This is achieved with the help of the earthworm Pheretima olongata. Aerobic bacteria multiply in the gut of the earthworm and decompose waste like sugars, starch, cellulose and protein into humus and simpler forms which can be easily assimilated by plants. The burrowing action of the worm tills the soil ten times deeper than the traditional plough. It increases porosity and aeration by breaking up the soil.\n<br>The worm feeds on garbage and excretes it as manure, known as vermicastings, which is a highly enriched kind of biofertiliser and contains hundreds of tiny earthworm cocoons to continue the process. It restores fertility to degraded soils and wastelands. Vermiculture can be done in a garbage bin in the kitchen. All food waste is chopped or crushed and spread in a layer in the bin, or on the soil in garden beds or special beds to which vermicastings have been applied.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio-sanitizer</b>\n<br>The bio sanitizer along with garden waste is yet another way of converting wet biodegradable waste arising from kitchens into rich organic manure. It has been proven to be the simplest, most cost effective, least labour intensive and most environmentally friendly method of converting biodegradable waste into useful good quality manure. This can be done on a large scale in bins or on a smaller scale in a pot or in one corner of the garden.\n<br>\n<br><b>Advantages\n</b><br>1. The biosanitizer is to be used only once when the bin is started.\n<br>2. Sujala is also put in the watering can only once.\n<br>3. No turnincy of waste is required.\n<br>4. Rich manure can be harvested once a year and the same bin can be re-used.\n<br>5. The cost of biosanitizer and Sujala is a one-time investment and is affordable.\n<br>6. Garbage can be treated at the source where it is generated and there is no dependency for its storage and disposal.\n<br>7. Enriched, organic manure is obtained instead of allowing garbage to spread and rot in the bins or on streets.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio gas Generation\n</b><br>Human excreta, animal droppings and plant and agricultural wastes can be processed in a biogas or gobar gas plant to produce fuel gas and rich manure. The plant consists of a circular tank shaped like a well. The tank is divided into two sections by a partition wall. It is covered on top by a cylindrical dome for the collection of gas.\n<br>\n<br>The two main products formed by anaerobic digestion are\n<br>1. fuel gas, which is approximately 55 per cent methane and 45 per cent carbon dioxide\n<br>2. manure, which is rich in nitrogen and humus.\n<br>\n<br>The gas produced can be used for cooking, lighting and running engines. Many companies are working towards large-scale production of biogas and manure from refuse collected by municipal corporations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Recycling\n</b><br>Recycling is the reprocessing of waste products so that they can be re-used.\n<br>Recycling food waste One way of utilising the energy from waste food is by using it as feed for pigs and poultry. It should be collected separately, taking care not to mix other refuse like cans, broken glass, etc. Waste food may be used for preparation of poultry feed after it is boiled well, shredded, dried and enriched with minerals. Destruction of all pathogens should be ascertained, otherwise they may find their way into the flesh of animals and ultimately reach the food consumed by humans. Recycling non-biodegradable waste All kinds of glass, plastic, polythene, paper and metal can be recycled. Each of these items should be collected in separate containers or bags and sent for recycling. This will drastically reduce the volume of garbage to be disposed off daily and indirectly reduce pollution.\n<br>The use of recycled plastics is, however, not permitted in the food industry.\n<br>\n<br><b>LIQUID WASTES OR SEWAGE</b>\n<br>Liquid wastes or sewage includes wastewater from sinks and drains from the kitchen, dishwashing areal laundry, bathrooms, toilets and other drains from the building and yard which is normally carried away by underground sewers.\n<br>It contains human excreta, chemicals like detergents, pesticides and oil and clean up wastewater rich in nutrients from animal and vegetable foods. It is one of the most dangerous sources of human pathogens and should not come in contact with food, water, utensils, equipment or any other food contact surface.\n<br>Sewage must be kept separate from other wastes because of the possible presence of human intestinal pathogens and the importance of guaranteeing their destruction. Disposal of sewage in a sanitary manner thus forms a pre-requisite for good food sanitation.\n<br>As far as possible, sewage should be disposed of in a public sewerage system or in a manner approved by the health authority. Care should be taken to prevent contamination of the ground and water supply and to keep all pests away. The temporary food service establishment operator needs to take special care.\n<br>In catering establishments located in towns and cities, sewage is removed through a system of underground sewers and drains called the water carriage system. These sewers take the sewage to a far off place away from the city. Before it is disposed of, it is treated in sewage treatment disposal farms or modern sewage treatment plants.\n<br>If the water carriage system is not available, sewage is treated in specially constructed septic tanks. Sewage should be treated before it is disposed of to reduce the possibilities of pollution and contamination.\n<br>Kitchen and wash up area wastewater should not be allowed to stagnate, if sewers or drains are not available. This water could be filtered and drained into the subsoil through a simple soakpit.\n<br>\n<br><b>Plumbing\n</b><br>Proper plumbing in a sanitary manner is essential to good food sanitation as it prevents sewage contamination of food in preparation and storage areas.\n<br>Problems commonly encountered with faulty plumbing are:\n<br>\n<br>1. leak in sewer pipes\n<br>2. cross-connections with potable water pipes\n<br>3. back flow of raw sewage\n<br>4. blockages or choked pipes\n<br>\n<br>Plumbing is necessary to safely carry sewage and liquid wastes from the catering establishment to the sewage disposal system and prevent any problems leading to contamination of food and water.\n<br>\n<br><b>GASEOUS WASTES</b>\n<br>Gaseous wastes include strong fumes originating from food being cooked and smoke from the kitchen, especially when wood or coal is used as cooking fuel. Gaseous wastes are a problem in the tandoori and barbecue sections of the Indian kitchen.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Even if wholesome food is selected, microorganisms are still present in and on food not all food items served on the menu are cooked, for example, salads and normal cooking procedures destroy most pathogens but not necessarily spores or toxins.\n<br>\n<br><b>Preparing Food\n</b><br>Procedures in Food Preparation The procedure to be followed will depend to a large extent on the food being prepared. Some common procedures which affect the microbial count are as follows:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Cleaning: </b>Cereals and pulses are picked before they are milled or cooked, to remove grit, mud, stones, husk, mouldy and insect-infested grains. Green leaves are separated from the inedible roots and tough stalks.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Washing:</b> Most foods need to be washed before preparation with potable cold water. Washing removes extraneous matter like surface dirt, soil and preservative and pesticide residue.\n<br>Fruits and vegetables to be consumed raw should be washed in a solution of 50 ppm chlorine for five minutes or in a dilute solution of potassium permanganate. Leafy and salad vegetables should be washed thoroughly.\n<br>Jn case of suspected or worm infestation, soak fresh vegetables like cauliflower in cold salted water for twenty minutes, If insects are present they will rise to the surface. Wash the body cavity of poultry well. Let all washed items drain well.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Pre preparation:</b> This step includes peeling, trimming and soaking. Potable water must be used for pre-preparation and cooking. Fruits and vegetables need to be peeled, trimmed and cut to remove inedible or spoilt parts. Grains are soaked for sprouting. Potable water should be used for all pre-preparations. No food or food container should be placed on the floor as the floor is heavily contaminated. Keep all food on racks or shelves.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Thawing:</b> Frozen foods should be thawed completely before cooking, unless the manufacturer, instructions are otherwise. Thawing large portions of food, joints and poultry takes time. Freezing only prevents bacteria from multiplying, it does not kill them. When a food thawed, these dormant microorganisms start multiplying rapidly once again.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Rules for Thawing Food Thaw or defrost food in any one of the following ways:\n</i></b><br>1. in the refrigerator below 40 C (39 F)\n<br>2. in a thawing cabinet at temperatures between 10-15C\n<br>3. in potable running water at 21c or below while it is still in the packet\n<br>4. in a microwave oven, only when it has to be cooked immediately\n<br>5. as part of conventional cooking, for example, certain frozen foods like frozen vegetables and ready-to-eat chicken preparations are cooked in the frozen state and quickly thaw when they are cooked.\n<br><br><b>Hot Holding of Food\n</b><br>In most commercial kitchens food service continues over a period of three to four hours during the busy lunch hour. In such cases it is more convenient to store food hot at temperatures above the danger zone, instead of cooling and reheating it every time before serving. For this purpose, a bain-marie or a hot cupboard is used. This equipment’s are heated by gas or electricity. Care should be taken that the internal temperature of the food should be above 63 C to prevent growth of bacteria. They should be pre-heated before placing hot food in them. They are not suitable for reheating cold foods as this process would take a lot of time to reach the safe temperature of 63 C and food would remain in the danger zone till then, permitting rapid multiplication of bacteria.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cooling Food\n</b><br>Any perishable food which is not to be consumed immediately should be kept outside the danger zone. Cold preparations like desserts should be cooled as soon as possible to 15C and stored in the refrigerator. Food should not be refrigerated while it is still hot, otherwise the maximum internal temperature in the refrigerator of 4C would increase and favor spoilage of other foods stored in the refrigerator. Food must be cooled prior to refrigeration in the coolest part of the kitchen. Large volumes cool faster when divided into smaller portions or when kept in shallow containers. Cooling can be hastened by keeping food containers in ice-cold water or in quick-chill units. Food cools faster when the container is placed in water, as water is a better conductor of heat than air. Stirring food occasionally brings about a uniform drop in temperature and faster cooling.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Other factors which influence the cooling process are\n</i></b><br>1. the type of food\n<br>2. the temperature in the refrigerator or quick-chill unit\n<br>3. the container used —size of container, material it is made of and covering if any.\n<br>\n<br>Cooked food which is not to be consumed immediately, should be refrigerated within 1 1/2 hours at 40C or below. If refrigerator space is inadequate, it is wise to purchase a quick-chill unit or extra bain-maries for ice chilling. Large catering units should have walk-in chillers for rapid cooling of cooked food.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hot Foods\n</b><br>To maintain high culinary quality, food should be prepared when it is needed and served as soon as it is prepared. But this situation is not feasible in most catering establishments as the volume of production is enormous and volume of sales cannot be accurately predicted. To serve hundreds of lunches in a two-hour lunch break, calls for preparing most of the items on the menu in advance. Foods which have to be served over an extended lunch hour can be held hot with the help of a bain-marie, double boiler, steam table or chaffing dish. The food handler should understand that these gadgets are not meant for reheating food but only for hot-holding of foods. If used for reheating, food will remain in the danger zone for a longer time.\n<br>The temperature at which food remains in the hot-holding equipment is very important and should not be less than 63C. If this temperature is not maintained, it is likely that food spoilage will occur rapidly. Before keeping food in any of these equipment’s, it should be heated to 74C (165 F) and transferred immediately.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The following precautions should be taken during hot holding of foods:\n</i></b><br>1. keep food covered to prevent heat loss\n<br>2. check temperature with a thermometer and not by just touching it with hand\n<br>3. stir food occasionally for even heating as lower surfaces get heated and upper surfaces get cooled by air\n<br>4. use proper serving equipment like long-handled ladles and scoops to minimize hand contact. Keep ladle in a clean place when not in use\n<br>5. prepare and keep only required amounts as extended heating will affect flavor and quality\n<br>6. dry preparations like chapatti’s, fried items and baked items may dry further or get overcooked during hot holding\n<br>\n<br><b>Storage Temperature of Prepared Foods\n</b><br>The Food Hygiene (Amendment) Regulations, 1990 and 1991 have introduced a complex set of controls over the storage temperatures of prepared foods. Foods are divided into two categories, some of which should be kept at 8C or less and some that should be kept at 5C or less. All hot foods must be kept above 63C. There are exemptions from temperature control for limited periods of time for foods freshly prepared on site or on display for sale in catering outlets. The 5C temperature requirement became effective on 01 April, 1993.\n<br>\n<br>Though chilling helps in extending the shelf life of food products, it can be effective only when high standards of hygiene are observed. The caterer should store all perishable products below 5C as soon as possible. The same chilled storage temperatures are applicable to food in large delivery vehicles. Small vans making local deliveries are allowed to operate to a standard of 8C for all foods, even those in the 5C category. Caterers should check temperatures on receiving deliveries. An allowance of 2C in the temperature is given for up to two hours for the following:\n<br>\n<br>1. defrosting of equipment\n<br>2. breakdown of refrigeration equipment\n<br>3. during cold food preparation in the kitchen\n<br>4. when food is moved around on the premises\n<br>Exemptions for certain foods from temperature control\n<br>1. Certain foods are processed in such a way that it prevents the growth of pathogens, for example, sterilized canned food. Canned foods which have been only pasteurized should be refrigerated and this should be indicated on the label.\n<br>2. Sandwiches with perishable fillings can be held at 8C or below for a period of 24 hours only.\n<br>3. Mawa or Khoa should always be refrigerated and used within 24 hours.\n<br>\n<br><b>PREPARATION OF SPECIFIC FOODS</b>\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Meat\n</i></b><br>Meat is a highly perishable food and gets contaminated from various sources by the time it reaches the kitchen. It should be washed and trimmed if required before it is cooked. Separate knives, cleavers and chopping boards should be used for raw and cooked meat to reduce chances of cross-contamination.\n<br>\n<br>Bacteria from raw meat may remain on improperly washed equipment and if the same equipment is used for cutting ready-to-eat meat, like cold cuts which are eaten without further cooking, the chances of food poisoning occurring become very high. The bacteria on the raw meat are likely to get destroyed once meat is cooked. After handling raw meat, wash hands well before touching cooked meat or any other ready-to-eat foods which are not going to be heated again.\n<br>In the butchery, work table surfaces should be made of impervious material which is easy to clean. The chopping block can be made of hardwood and should be light enough to be removed for cleaning, scraping and rinsing after every use. While deboning meat and making rolled joints, chances of contamination increase. Such joints should be cut into small portions and cooked well to kill microorganisms that may be present in the centre of the cut.\n<br>\n<br>Minced meat is at a higher risk than meat because microorganisms present on the outer surface of meat get distributed throughout the entire mass of mince. Minced meat is also handled more and spoils much faster, leading to discoloration and foul odors and may cause food-borne illnesses. To reduce the chances of spoilage, the following precautions should be taken:\n<br>\n<br>1. mince the quantity required for the day only\n<br>2. cook mince thoroughly at sufficiently high temperatures\n<br>3. surplus mince should be cooled rapidly in small portions\n<br>4. refrigerate surplus immediately\n<br>5. reheat mince thoroughly before serving\n<br>6. if root vegetables like potatoes, carrots or onions are cooked along with mince, clean them thoroughly to remove heat-resistant soil organisms.\n<br><br><b><i>Fish\n</i></b><br>The best way to prepare fish is to place a stone slab long enough to fit across the sink used for fish preparation and about two-third the width of the sink. Place a hard wood board on it for cutting fish. This arrangement allows a continuous flow of clean water with the wash water going down the drain of the sink.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\n</i></b><br>Vegetables should be thoroughly washed to remove all traces of soil. If necessary, root vegetables may have to be soaked for some time and scrubbed clean as soil may contain Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli along with other intestinal pathogens. Some vegetables, like carrots and ginger, may be scraped, fruits should be washed well and peeled if required before they are served. Peeling helps in reducing microbial load and preservative or pesticide residue if any.\n<br>Green leafy vegetables should be washed under running water. Lettuce should be broken up and washed. Leaves should be drained well. A separate sink should be allotted for vegetables and fruit preparation. Spoilt, inedible portions should be removed.\n<br>When food is handled carelessly it is likely to get contaminated or spoilt and may result in food poisoning.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Dept.  But since hospitality units require quite large amounts of water they are required to have buffer stock of water and for which large tanks and reservoirs are required. Hospitality units generally have their own stand by arrangement for water supply in the form of bore wells. Bore wells are to be dug with the permission of local civic authorities and they charge yearly rent for bore well. Since the bore well provides hard water the hotel has to invest in a water treatment plant. The water is supplied to the various locations in the hotel by means of a large network of pipes, pipe fittings, valves etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Water Distributions\n</b><br>\n<br><b>A. Cold Water Distribution System in a Hotel\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>1. Raising Main</i></b> – It is a supply pipe line that rises from ground level to the storage tank on the roof top. Since the supply pressure is not enough, there are intermediate booster pumps to enable the water to reach the top storage tanks. Some times intermediate storage and multiple tanks are used for serving a group of intermediate floors. The water is stored in the storage tank through the raising main, the storage tank is located at the highest point in the building to ensure a reasonable pressure in the distribution pipes .\n<br><b><i>2. Discharge or Service Piping</i></b> – Water for drinking, kitchen and wash basins etc. is directly taken from the rising main by branch pipe at different floors and flows into the service taps. The stop valves should be fitted immediately after the exit from the tanks for disconnecting the pipeline distribution system in case of leakage in tank or pipe system.\n<br><b><i>3. Valves</i></b> – are generally gate valves used to completely open or close the water lines .\n<br><b><i>4. Storage Tank </i></b>:\n<br>A. Float Valve / Ball Valve – is a spherical rubber ball at the inlet pipe (at the top of the tank), drops down and opens the inlet when the water level falls and rises as the water level rises and finally closes the inlet when the tank is full. An alarm generally gives the signal that the tank is full.\n<br>B. Silencer pipe – This is fitted at the end of the inlet pipe to lower the point of discharge a little above the bottom of the tank. It reduces the water filling noise in the tank.\n<br>C. Overflow Pipe – It works when the float valve is out of water.\n<br>D. Lid – Covers the tank.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. Hot Water Distribution System in a Hotel\n</b><br>Cold water raised to a temperature of 38C is usually considered as hot. The operating temperature range is 49 to 60 degree Celsius. In hotels the most prevalent system for hot water are:\n<br>\n<br>1. Centralized hot water generation and distribution system.\n<br>2. Localized hot water generation and distribution system.\n<br>\n<br><b>Centralised Hot Water System:\n</b><br>This system is usually employed in large hotels. Three different principles used to generate hot water are:\n<br>* Direct Heating System\n<br>* Indirect Heating System\n<br>* Solar Water Heating System\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Direct Heating System\n</b><br>• This system involves natural circulation .\n<br>• Hot water from the boiler circulates through a hot water tank called cylinder.\n<br>• Circulation continues because hot water being lighter rises up to the cylinder from the boiler and cold water descends down to the boiler.\n<br>• The service pipes are taken from the cylinder to service taps.\n<br>• A cold water system is connected to the boiler from where cold water runs into the boiler via stop valves.\n<br>• Whenever there is increase in volume of water and cylinder is unable to accommodate this, the resulting pressure would lead o the possible busting of pipes.\n<br>• To avoid this possible bursting, the water is supplied to an overhead cistern.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages:\n</b><br>• Oxygen released while heating cold water causes rusting of boiler.\n<br>• Boiling can lead to sever scale formation\n<br>\n<br><b>Indirect Water Heating\n</b><br>In this system the water cylinder is replaced by a direct heat exchanger called the calorifier where hot water or steam from the boiler enters the calorifier through a coil of tubes and heats the cold water passing through the calorifier.\n<br>\n<br>Two circulations are followed.\n<br>• Primary Circulation – takes place between the boiler and the calorifier\n<br>• Secondary Circulation – takes place between the calorifier and service taps.\n<br>\n<br><b>Solar Water Heating System\n</b><br>Is the most efficient and eco friendly water heating system. Each evacuated tube is similar to a thermos in principle. A glass or metal tube containing the water or heat transfer fluid is surrounded by a larger glass tube. The space between them is a vacuum, so very little heat is lost from the fluid.\n<br>These collectors can even work well in overcast conditions and operate in temperatures as low as -40°F. Individual tubes are replaced as needed.\n<br>A solar thermal collector collects heat by absorbing sunlight. A collector is a device for capturing solar radiation.\n<br>The quantity of solar energy striking the Earth's surface (solar constant) averages about 1,000 watts per square meter under clear skies, depending upon weather conditions, location and orientation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Localized Hot Water System:\n</b><br>\n<br>Storage Tank Water Heater (Geyser):\n<br>• A thermostat controls the temperature of water and it can be heated at any desired temperature.\n<br>• There are two light bulbs provided in the geyser. The red bulb indicates the water is being heated and the green bulb indicates that water is heated up to the desired temperature.\n<br>• Automatic heating begins if the temperature of the heated water falls below the set level.\n<br>• Geysers are used when the duration of hot water supply is limited.\n<br>• May require maintenance if hard water is being used.\n<br>\n<br><b>Thankless Water Heaters:\n</b><br>• When the hot water tap is turned on, water enters the heater.\n<br>• The flow sensor detects the water flow.\n<br>• The burner is automatically ignited.\n<br>• Water circulates through the heat exchanger.\n<br>• The heat exchanger heats the water up to the designated temperature.\n<br>• When the tap is turned off, the unit shuts down.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Simple boiling removes this hardness.\n<br>* Permanent or non-carbonic hardness: it is due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates of both calcium and magnesium. Simple boiling cannot remove his hardness. Use of chemicals and ion exchange methods are used to remove the permanent hardness.\n<br>\n<br><b>Effects of Hard Water\n</b><br>\n<br>It produces less lather with soap, resulting in more soap consumption.\n<br>It produces soap cum, which produces a dirty feeling during and after bath and wash.\n<br>It causes scale formation inside the water boilers and boiling utensils and thus results in corrosion and reduces the heat transfer efficiency.\n<br>It causes turbidity during boiling of water.\n<br>It affects the taste and structure of cooked food.\n<br>Too much intake of hard water affects the digestive process in human beings. It also leads to other heath issues.\n<br>It dis colors fabric.&nbsp;<br><br><b>TEMPORARY HARDNESS</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>Method of Removing Temporary Hardness or Carbonate Hardness</b>\n<br>The temporary hardness of water can be removed either by boiling or by adding lime to the water. This is called temporary hardness because the hardness is removed simply by boiling it. We now discuss both the methods.\n<br>\n<br><b>Boiling :\n</b><br>Rain water when falling absorbs carbon dioxide (C02) in air. Calcium carbonate inside the earth, being only slightly soluble, will usually exist in water as calcium bicarbonate because it easily dissolves in the water containing C02. When such water is boiled, the C02 gas will get out, while insoluble CaC03 comes out of water as a thick white precipitate, which can be sediment out in the settling tank.\n<br>\n<br>The down arrow sign (↓) by the side of a chemical product denotes that it is insoluble in the solution and would form a precipitate and can be removed from the solution (water in this case) by filtering or decantation process. The up arrow sign ( ↑) by the side of a chemical product denotes that it is a gas and goes out of the system as a product of the chemical reaction.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO3)2 + Heat -----------&gt; CaCO3 ↓+ CO2 ↑+ H2O\n<br>Mg(HCO3)2 + Heat -----------&gt; MgCO3 ↓+ CO2 ↑+ H2O\n<br>\n<br>Calcium and magnesium carbonates arc insoluble in water, and hence accumulate as thick while precipitate at the bottom and can be removed in the sedimentation tank. The carbon dioxide formed is liberated as gas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Addition of lime (also called Clarke's process)\n</b><br>The calculated amount of lime (CaO) or, more generally, hydrated lime is added to the water. The reaction takes place between magnesium bicarbonate and hydrated lime, between calcium bicarbonate and hydrated lime. The calcium carbonates and magnesium can be removed in the sedimentation tank. The reactions that take place are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Ca (HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 -----------&gt; 2CaCO3 ↓+2H2o\n<br>Mg(HCO3)2 +2Ca(OH)2 -----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ 2 CaCO3 ↓+2H2O\n<br><br><br><br><b>PERMANENT HARDNESS</b><br><br><br><b>Method of Removing Permanent Hardness or non-Carbonate Hardness\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Washing soda process\n</b><br>The chemical formula of washing soda is Na2C03. The reactions that take place on adding washing soda solution to hard water are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Na2CO3 +CaSO4 -----------&gt; CaCO3 🡫+ Na2SO4\n<br>Na2CO3 + MgCI2 -----------&gt; MgCO3 🡫 + 2NaCI\n<br>\n<br><b>Caustic soda process\n</b><br>Caustic soda can be used to remove both carbonate (temporary) and non-carbonate (permanent) hardness. Calcium and magnesium hydrogen carbonates react with caustic soda to produce insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide.\n<br>\n<br>2NaOH + MgSO4-----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ Na2SO4\n<br>2NaOH+ CaCl2 -----------&gt; Ca(OH)2 ↓+ 2NaCl\n<br>2NaOH + Mg(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ 2Na2CO3+2H20\n<br>2NaOH+Ca(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; CaCO3 ↓+ 2Na2CO3 + H2o\n<br>\n<br>From the above reactions, we find that this process not only removes permanent hardness but also temporary hardness. This process is very efficient for low alkalinity water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Ion exchange by resin or demineralization process for removing hardness\n</b><br>\n<br>There are many pieces of equipment in industry, such as water boiler and other process equipment and scientific apparatus, which would need water free of any minerals. The process by which the minerals are removed is known as demineralization (DM) and the plant is known as DM plant. Since this process helps us in completely removing or reducing the mineral content to any desired extent, it is very suitable for producing water of any desired hardness or even mineral free water. The demineralized water is sometimes called deionized water and is as pure as distilled water.\n<br>The process consists of passing the water through cation exchange resins, which produce almost similar effects as are produced in the zeolite method, except that hydrogen (instead of sodium) is exchanged for the basic metallic ions. The cation exchange resins in fact are phenol aldehyde condensation products.\n<br>Their chemical formula may be represented by H2R, which represents the hydrogen ion and R represents the organic part of the substance.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO3)2 + H2R -----------&gt; CaR +2H2O+2CO2\n<br>Na2CO3+H2R -----------&gt; Na2R + H2O + CO2\n<br>\n<br>Thus, we find that these cation exchange resins exchange sodium ions also, which come out of the water forming exchanged resin (Na2R), making water free from minerals. However, absolutely pure water can be very corrosive if it comes in contact with air, thus absorbing oxygen from it as this water has a strong affinity for oxygen.\n<br>\n<br><b>Calgon softener\n</b><br>Calgon is the trade name of a complex salt, sodium hexametaphosphate (NaP03)6. It is used for softening hard water. Calgon ionizes to give a complex anion, which subsequently combines with Ca and Mg ions in hard water.\n<br>\n<br>(NaPO3)6 or Na2 (Na4P6O18). 2Na + Na4P6O2(18)\n<br>\n<br>The addition of Calgon to hard water causes the calcium and magnesium ions of hard water to displace sodium ions from the anion of Calgon according to the following reaction:\n<br>\n<br>Caso4 +Na2 (Na4P6O18) -----------&gt; Na2SO4 + Ca (Na4P6O18)\n<br>\n<br>This results in the removal of calcium and magnesium ions from hard water in the form of a complex compound with Calgon. The water is, thus, softened. Sodium salts are released into water without causing any hardness. It is being dosed into water used for washing machine, dyeing work, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Zeolite (or permutit) or base exchange or cation exchange process\n</b><br>Hardness can be very effectively and economically removed by using a chemical called zeolite. Zeolite (a green salt generally termed as green sand) is a naturally available salt (Na2O, AI2O3, 4SiO2, 2H2O) which reacts with salts in hard water and forms insoluble salts of Ca and Mg. This is also manufactured synthetically and the white coloured salt is sold under the name of 'Permutit' which is, chemically, hydrated sodium aluminium orthosilicate, having the formula Na2[(AIO2)2(SiO2)2]. xH20 .\n<br>\n<br>Permutit is manufactured from naturally available feldspar, kaoline clay, and soda. In chemical equations, we use the short form of the chemical as sodium zeolite (Na2Z) where Z represents [(A102)2 (Si02)2].\n<br>Hence, the process of removing hardness by using this chemical is known as zeolite process as well as 'permutit process'. Any salt has a positively charged part (or cations) and negatively charged part (or anions). Usually, the metallic part of the salt is cation (also called base). For example, in calcium carbonate, calcium is the base or cation and carbonate is the anion. These zeolites have the excellent property of exchanging their cations (sodium) with those (calcium and magnesium) in hard water, which enables them to perform the softening operation. The sodium ions of the zeolite get replaced by the calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water, forming insoluble calcium zeolite and magnesium zeolite.\n<br>\n<br>Softening reaction\n<br>Na2Z +. Ca or Mg Salt --------------&gt; Na2 Salt + Ca or Mg zeolite\n<br>\n<br>After a few days of operation, all the active sodium zeolite should change to used calcium and magnesium zeolite. However, calcium and magnesium zeolite can be converted back into active sodium zeolite by reacting it with 10 per cent solution of sodium chloride (common table salt solution).\n<br>This process is known as regeneration. The exchange reaction that takes place during regeneration can be represented as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Regeneration Reaction\n<br>CaZ/MgZ. +2NaCI --------------&gt; Na2Z + CaCI2/MgCI2\n<br>\n<br><b>Working of a zeolite softening plant\n</b><br>A zeolite softener (or a cation exchange unit) resembles a sand filter in which the filtering medium is a zeolite rather than sand, as shown in image. The hard water enters through the top as shown in the figure and is evenly distributed on the entire zeolite bed. As the hard water passes through the bed, reactions as given above take place and the softened water is collected through the strainers at the base. The zeolite bed is increasingly depleted in its active sodium zeolite content with increasing proportion of Ca and Mg zeolite, When a significant portion of the sodium in the zeolite has been replaced by calcium and magnesium, softening process is stopped by stopping flow of hard water and regeneration operation is started first by washing the bed with good soft water and then passing per cent solution of brine through the bed. The excess brine solution retained in the zeolite, as well as the soluble Ca and Mg chloride salts removed from the activated zeolite bed, after the treatment, are removed by again washing them with good soft water.\n<br>The regenerated zeolite is now ready and can be used afresh for softening.\n<br>The rate of filtration through a zeolite softener is about 300 liters per square meter per minute.\n<br>\n<br><b>Advantages of zeolite process\n</b><br>The advantages of zeolite process are as follows:\n<br>• Zero hardness can be obtained and have specific uses in textile industries boilers, etc.\n<br>• The plants are compact, automatic, and easy to operate.\n<br>• The Running, Maintenance, and Operation (RMO) cost is quite less.\n<br>• It also removes iron and manganese from water.\n<br>• There is no problem in treating water of varying quality<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

But acc. to the norms of the PCB (Pollution Control Board) , sewage needs to be properly treated before it is disposed.  \n<br>\n<br><b>SEWAGE TREATMENT:\n</b><br>It is the process of removing the contaminants from sewage to convert it to a composition of clear liquid and solid, which are fit for discharge to the environment or for reuse.\n<br> \n<br><b>SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT\n</b><br>• In the most sophisticated treatment, clear potable water can be obtained while leaving only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of solids after treatment.\n<br>• This solid part, called sludge, is further processed to produce what is called bio solid, which have many uses.\n<br>• While hoteliers can discharge their sewage to the public sewerage, along with town sewage, for treatment in the city sewage treatment plant and final disposal.\n<br>• Many hotels have opted for in-house, Sewage Treatment Plants, where they get fresh water for reuse and may use the sludge as manure for garden activities.\n<br>• The fundamental principal of purifying sewage is to completely break down the original organic matter in it by the action of microorganisms (bacteria). These microorganisms digest (eat away) the original organic matter leaving a clear effluent and solids.\n<br>\n<br><b>The stages in treatment of sewage are as follows:\n</b><br>1. Primary Treatment: This removes the suspended and floating objects by means of strainer, screens, grit chamber, sedimentation tanks, septic tanks, etc. The typical materials that are removed in this stage include large objects such as sticks, rugs, rocks, sand, gravel, fats, oils, grease etc.\n<br>2. Secondary Treatment: This treatment is designed to degrade the biological and organic content of the sewage by means of microbial action. The bacteria present in the sewage consume all the organic matter.\n<br>3. Tertiary process with or without disinfectant: The final treatment is performed at this stage before making eventual disposal of the treated wastewater. Tertiary treatment comprises of many processes and includes filtration, disinfection and removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which encourage algae formation. Disinfection can be done with chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet treatment. In many cases, disinfection is done as the last activity (also called effluent polishing). The purpose of disinfection is to destroy residual bacteria in water after secondary treatment, thus rendering it very safe for final disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Methods of Sewage Disposal\n</b><br>Sewage disposal is broadly classified into the following types:&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A part evaporates, while a part percolate. Purification is accomplished by natural oxidation. This is a very good method of sewage disposal where land is available. Bright sunshine helps in microbial activities in the sewage. Decomposed sewage becomes an excellent manure for crops. However, if harmful bacteria percolate through ground subsoil reaching the ground water, it could contaminate ground water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical Treatment:</b> Effected by addition of chemicals such as lime, alum etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Septic Tank</b> – Used to provide disposal of sewage in a plain sedimentation tank where biochemical reactions (decomposition) also takes place. After decomposition sewage is purified and effluent is taken to soak pits for disposal to city sewers. The solid portion remains in the septic tank due to which the septic tank should be cleaned after a period of 2 to 5 years.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio-aeration</b> – The sewage is first passed through coarse screens to get rid of large solids. The sewage is then treated in the main aeration tank with compressed air.\n<br>\n<br><b>GREEN HOTELS</b>\n<br>Green hotels are environmentally friendly properties that take the initiative and implement very important practices and programs to reduce energy, water, and waste.Green Hotels are participating in recycling programs, linen changing programs, installing energy efficient lighting, and getting their message out to their guests and how they are doing their part in protecting the planet.  \n<br>\n<br><b>Ways to control pollution in hotels\n<br></b>\n<br><b>1. Install Energy Saving Technologies\n</b><br>It has been estimated that 75% of hotels' environmental impacts can be directly related to excessive consumption—including energy consumption. Installing energy-efficient technologies such as appliances, lighting, and heating and cooling systems can make a difference for both the environment and your hotel's bottom line.\n<br><b>2. Embrace Recycling\n</b><br>Another huge impact the hospitality industry has on the environment is due to the amount of waste hotels create. It's time to embrace recycling, and we're not just talking about using cloth napkins instead of paper.\n<br>According to the Green Hotels Association, a hotel in Toronto is recycling stained tablecloths into napkins, chef's aprons, and neckties, while other hotels are making cloth laundry bags from retired sheets. These are the sort of initiatives that can make a long-term difference when put into practice.\n<br><b>3. Encourage Guests to be Green\n</b><br>Put cards in each room asking guests to turn out the lights when they leave, or reuse towels if possible. Make recycling bins readily available to guests and be sure that they are aware of your green programs. When guests see that your hotel is making an effort to help the environment, they will want to do their part as well.\n<br>For those hotels looking to do even more, consider loaning or renting bicycles to guests, or look into installing a bike-sharing station.\n<br><b>4. Start Composting\n</b><br>An increasing number of hotels are realizing the benefits of composting food waste rather than throwing it out. Not only is it a popular and well-known green initiative that will impress your guests, it can save your hotel money on landscaping since composted waste can be used as organic fertilizer.\n<br><b>5. Save Water\n</b><br>There are so many ways hotels can save water: Installing toilet tank fill divert in older toilets can save about 3/4 of a gallon of water per flush. Transitioning to nearly water less laundry machines can save 80% of hotel water usage. Making water stations available to guests can discourage the use of bottled water. Follow the examples from other hotels that have implemented water-saving initiatives.\n<br><b>6. Plant a Garden\n</b><br>If you're considering expanding your outdoor offerings for guests, consider adding a garden rather than simply extending your patio or pool area. The Green Hotels Association notes that one Pennsylvania property has a 400-foot garden and produces organically-grown vegetables for its restaurant.\n<br>Now you don't have to go that far, but even a small garden (perhaps even on the rooftop for those of you with city properties) can help counteract your hotel's carbon footprint. Raised beds can be installed almost anywhere, and placing benches—made from recycled materials—around a garden can make for a wonderful guest experience.\n<br><b>7. Support Local, Sustainable Businesses\n</b><br>Hotels can help reduce their environmental impact by making smart purchasing choices as well. A hotel can reduce waste generation by making an effort to only purchase environmentally-friendly products, and purchasing locally can also reduce the impact on the environment and benefit the community.\n<br>You may also want to consider promoting other environmentally-friendly businesses to guests, such as local farm-to-table restaurants.\n<br><b>8. Implement Alternative Energy Sources\n</b><br>A number of hotels have switched at least portions of their energy usage to alternative sources, with great results.\n<br><b>9. Take Care of Your Linens\n</b><br>We already mentioned recycling linens as a way to limit waste, but what about extending the life of those linens in the first place? Using laundry processes that limit the wear and tear on your linens can keep replacement costs, and your hotel's environmental impact, down.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In practice, conservation is the act of protecting, managing, and restoring shared earth resources such as soil, air, forests, minerals, petroleum, wildlife, and water one of humans' most essential resources.\n<br>Conservation generally involves managing natural resources to serve people, whether by providing materials for essential needs (water, food, shelter, and energy) and consumer products (cars, clothing, computers, furniture), or simply by protecting wild areas where people can enjoy nature and outdoor recreation. While most scientists do not argue with using Earth's natural resources to meet human needs, most scientists also agree with the general idea that shared natural resources should be protected from overuse and pollution, and wisely managed using sound scientific information.\n<br>\n<br><b>Need For Water Conservation\n</b><br>Water is Earth's most plentiful natural resource. It covers almost three-quarters of our planet's surface. Astronauts say Earth looks like a \"blue marble\" from space with its blue oceans and white swirls of water droplets (clouds) in the atmosphere (mass of air surrounding Earth). Water is also a renewable resource. Water moves endlessly within the hydro-logic cycle, and is almost never destroyed in the process. When humans draw water from lakes, rivers, oceans, or groundwater reservoirs (aquifers), new water replaces it. Water is even self-cleansing. When it evaporates, it leaves pollution and salts behind and forms clouds that produce fresh rainwater. New water that flows into polluted lakes and rivers acts to dilute (lower the concentration or amount) and disperse (spread out) pollutants.\n<br>• Ninety-seven % of all water on the earth is salt water, which is not suitable for drinking.\n<br>• Only 3% of water on Earth is fresh water, and only 0.5% is available for drinking.\n<br>• The other 2.5% of fresh water is locked in ice caps, glaciers, the atmosphere, soil, or under the earth's surface, or is too polluted for consumption.\n<br>With growing population rates and such a small percentage of all the water on Earth fit for consumption, it only makes sense that we must preserve and conserve this precious resource.\n<br>Did you know that nearly 1 billion people, mostly in the developing world, have no access to safe water? More than double this number - about 2.4 billion - has no access to any form of improved sanitation facilities. They could use your help to get it.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reasons to Conserve Water\n</b><br>Below are some of the main reasons it is important to conserve water.\n<br>• It minimizes the effects of drought and water shortages. Even though our need for fresh water sources is always increasing because of population and industry growth, the supply we have stays constant. Even though water eventually returns to Earth through the water cycle, it's not always returned to the same spot, or in the same quantity and quality. By reducing the amount of water we use, we can better protect against future drought years.\n<br>• It guards against rising costs and political conflict. Failing to conserve water can eventually lead to a lack of an adequate water supply, which can have drastic consequences. These include rising costs, reduced food supplies, health hazards, and political conflict.\n<br>• It helps to preserve our environment. Reducing our water usages reduces the energy required to process and deliver it to homes, businesses, farms, and communities, which, in turn, helps to reduce pollution and conserve fuel resources.\n<br>• It makes water available for recreational purposes. It's not just swimming pools, spas, and golf courses that we have to think about. Much of our freshwater resources are also used for beautifying our surroundings—watering lawns, trees, flowers, and vegetable gardens, as well as washing cars and filling public fountains at parks. Failing to conserve water now can mean losing out on such uses later on.\n<br>• It builds safe and beautiful communities: Fire-fighters, hospitals, gas stations, street cleaners, health clubs, gyms, and restaurants all require large amounts of water to provide services to the community. Reducing our usage of water now means that these services can continue to be provided.\n<br>\n<br><b>Water Conservation in Hotel\n</b><br>The first thing to do if you want to understand how to lower your water bill is to conduct something called a water audit. A water audit is a process to figure out how much water your business is using and exactly where it’s all going. Though the best way to get accurate results is to hire an energy consulting firm, this can be done in a more general way by yourself and/or your staff. If you choose to conduct your own water audit, you should start by looking at two things: your previous water bills and your water meter(s).\n<br>Understand the Flow\n<br>Once you have an idea of your usage rates you want to dig deeper to find out where that lump sum of water is actually flowing. From there, you can move on to deciding how to conserve water. To do that, you need usage information from each and every fixture and appliance in your hotel that uses water. Here’s list to get you started:\n<br>• Sinks\n<br>• Faucets\n<br>• Showers\n<br>• Toilets\n<br>• Dishwashers\n<br>• Washing Machines\n<br>• Ice Machines\n<br>• Cooling Towers (part of your HVAC System)\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Restrooms\n</b><br>• Low flow and high efficiency toilets will save you money immediately. REMEMBER: Dual-flush toilets should be equipped with posted instructions so that everyone understands how to use them!\n<br>• Have sink aerators installed; these reduce the flow of water by 1.5 gallons/minute.\n<br>• Install shower heads that regulate flow; 2.5 gallons/minute or less will not bother your guests, while saving you big time.\n<br>• Install motion activated sensors for hotel sinks and restroom facilities. This not only controls the amount of time water is used, but your guests will appreciate hands-free options.\n<br>• Install timers in your hotel showers. This is a gentle reminder to guests to be conscious of water conservation.\n<br>• Many urinals are no-flush, but there are new energy efficient models on the market which may provide a more pleasant user experience.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Kitchen\n</b><br>• Upgrade to ENERGY STAR® rated equipment. This alone will reduce water usage by approximately 10%.\n<br>• Install sink aerators to reduce the flow of water to 2.5 gallons/minute or less.\n<br>• Install pedal operated faucets. This will reduce the ability for staff to turn on a faucet and walk away while leaving it running.\n<br>• Turn off continuous flow water streams when not in immediate use.\n<br>• Pre-soak dishes.\n<br>• Only run fully loaded dish racks through the washer.\n<br>• Defrost food in refrigerators instead of under running water. With just a bit of foresight, you will save thousands of gallons/year by eliminating this unnecessary cost.\n<br>• Wash vegetables in water basins rather than under running water.\n<br>• Fix leaky water lines immediately.\n<br>• Educate your staff about water usage and encourage them to be conscious of how they use water.\n<br>• Install food traps or compost food waste, rather than automatically and excessively using your garbage disposal which requires running water to work properly.\n<br>\n<br><b> Hotel Landscaping\n</b><br>• Water your hotel landscape 2 to 3 times a week instead of every day.\n<br>• Remove weeds and other unwanted plants to preserve water for your desired landscape.\n<br>• Do not over-fertilize or over-prune plants to avoid overstimulated growth.\n<br>• Avoid hosing down hotel sidewalks, parking lots and driveways, unless absolutely necessary.\n<br>• Install soil moisture override systems and timers on hotel sprinkler systems.\n<br>• Time watering when evaporation is the lowest: early morning or evenings are the key.\n<br>• Make sure irrigation equipment applies water evenly; if it’s watering anything other than the lawn and garden, it’s wasting your money.\n<br>• Use mulch around plants to help avoid evaporation and keep weeds to a minimum.\n<br>• Install drip irrigation instead of sprinkler systems.\n<br>• Install rain sensors on your sprinkler system so you don’t end up watering in the rain!\n<br>• Install rain barrels or other water catchment systems to catch water as it falls from the sky for free for later use in landscape watering.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>A Few More …..\n</i></b><br>• Sweep floors whenever possible to clean them. Avoid washing down sidewalks and surfaces with hoses, which waste a lot of water in this application.\n<br>• Consider switching your mopping system to the water broom, a new technology that saves water while delivering maximum cleaning power.\n<br>• Conduct an audit of your housecleaning staff and their procedures and keep an eye out for excessive water usage during cleaning.\n<br>• Discourage water-wasting practices in the housekeeping staff, like using the bathtub as a mopping station.\n<br>• Switch your hotel’s carpet cleaning process from wet to dry.\n<br>• Have windows cleaned on an as-needed basis, as opposed to a set schedule which may be unnecessary.\n<br>• Consider switching any water cooled equipment to air cooled – in addition to your ice machines this could include air compressors and refer condensers.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Voltage\" (V) is the potential for energy to move and is analogous to water pressure.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a amp?\n</b><br>An \"amp\", short for ampere, is a unit of electrical current which is defines in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. \"Amperage\" is the strength of a current of electricity expressed in amperes.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is an ohm?\n</b><br>\"Ohm\" is a unit of an electric circuit that is defined as the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a watt?\n</b><br>A \"watt\" is a measure of power. One watt (W) is the rate at which work is done when one ampere (A) of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt (V).\n<br>\n<br>Simple way to understand……\n<br>Watts = Amps x Volts\n<br>Volt = Watts / Amps\n<br>Amps = Watts / Volts\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Fuses and Circuit Breakers\n</b><br>Fuses and Circuit Breakers both serve the same purpose – which is to protect electrical circuits by preventing overloads that can cause fires. They both interrupt the flow of electricity, but in very different ways from each other.\n<br>\n<br><b>Fuses</b>\n<br>Fuses come in different types – for both residential and commercial use. The most common type is made from a metal wire or a filament that is enclosed in a glass or ceramic and metal casing. In residential homes, the fuse is usually plugged into a central fuse box, where the building’s wiring passes through. When electricity flows, the fuse will permit the power to pass unobstructed across the filament between circuits. If overloads occur, the filament melts and stops the flow of electricity.\n<br>\n<br><b>Circuit Breakers\n</b><br>Circuit breakers on the other hand, have internal switch mechanisms that can be tripped by an unsafe surge of electricity.\n<br>Circuit Breakers have two different ways of working – the first is through the use of an electromagnet and the other is through the use of a bi-metal strip. In both instances, when turned on, the breaker allows electrical current to pass from a bottom to an upper terminal across the strip. Once the current reaches any unsafe levels, the magnetic force of the strip becomes strong enough to throw a metal lever in the switch mechanism, breaking the current. The other option that can happen is that the metal strip can bend, throwing the switch and breaking the connection. \n<br>\n<br><b>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage\n</b><br>* Fuse is a less expensive device to protect from over current. It reacts quicker than the circuit breakers, and it as a hope that it won’t cause more failure than the breakers because of it as less moving parts. Whereas in circuit breakers if the inner working parts have some faulty, the damage to the electrical appliances will be more because they react slower than the fuse.\n<br>* One must be careful when replacing the fuse. If you install a 30amp fuse on a 20amp circuit, it ultimately leads to cause an electric fire.\n<br>* Keep on replacing melted fuses can become more expensive but, in circuit breakers, you need to flip the switch.\n<br>* Installation of a circuit breaker is complicated and expensive and also the maintenance cost is high but in a long-term, it saves a lot of money.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>The Difference Between Fuse and Circuit Breaker\n</b><br>* Fuse works on the principle of electrical and thermal properties of the conducting materials whereas the Circuit breaker works on the Electromagnetism and switching principle.\n<br>* Fuses once used cannot be reused again, but the Circuit breaker can be reused. Hence, there is no need to change the circuit breaker after any fault takes place and the coil is tripped.\n<br>* Fuse cannot be used as an ON/OFF switch whereas Circuit Breaker can be used as an ON/OFF switch.\n<br>* Fuses are independent of ambient temperature, but Circuit Breaker not require any ambient temperature.\n<br>* The Fuse provides protection against only power overloads whereas Circuit Breaker provides protection for both power overloads and short circuits.\n<br>* Breaking capacity of the fuse is low as compared to that of a Circuit Breaker.\n<br>* Operating time of fuse is very less about 0.002 second, whereas Operating time of a Circuit Breaker is comparatively more than that of the fuse. It is about 0.02 – 0.05 second.\n<br>* Mode of operation of Fuse is completely automatic, but Circuit Breakers can be operated manually as well as automatically with the help of a relay system.\n<br>* The cost of the fuse is low, whereas Circuit Breakers are more costly.\n<br>\n<br><b>Voltage drop\n</b><br>A voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when a current passes through the cable. It is related to the resistance or impedance to current flow with passive elements in the circuits including cables, contacts and connectors affecting the level of voltage drop. The longer the circuit or length of cable the greater the voltage loss. The impact of a voltage drop can cause problems such as motors running slowly, heaters not heating to full potential, lights being dimmed. To compensate for voltage drop larger cross-sectional sized cables may be used which offer less resistance / impedance to current flow.\n<br>\n<br>V=IR\n<br>Ohms Law: V = I R\n<br>*Ohm’s Law (I = V/R) says:\n<br>* The current (I) through a wire or electrical resistor is\n<br>* proportional to the potential difference V across the two ends, and\n<br>* inversely proportional to its resistance R.\n<br>* Resistance (R) depends on Surface\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Single- phase &amp; three- phase electric power  \n</b><br>* single-phase electric power is the distribution of alternating current electric power using a system in which all the voltages of the supply vary in unison. Single-phase distribution is used when loads are mostly lighting and heating, with few large electric motors. A single-phase supply connected to an alternating current electric motor does not produce a rotating magnetic field; single-phase motors need additional circuits for starting (capacitor start motor), and such motors are uncommon above 10 kW in rating.\n<br>\n<br>* Three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating current voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400 V across any two phases.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Three Phase Supply Benefits\n</b><br>* Copper Utilization Reduction\n<br>* Lessening of Security Risks for Employees\n<br>* Labour Treatment Costs\n<br>* The efficiency of the Conductor is Greater\n<br>* Facility to Run High Power Loads\n<br>\n<br><b>Single Phase Supply Benefits\n</b><br>* The benefits of choosing a single phase supply include the following.\n<br>* The design is less complex\n<br>* Design cost is less\n<br>* Most efficient AC power supply for up to 1000 watts\n<br>* Single Phase AC Power Supply is most competent for up to 1000 watts.\n<br>* Wide-range of application uses\n<br>\n<br><b>Key Differences between Single Phase and Three Phase Supplies\n</b><br>* The definition of the single-phase power supply is, the power supplies through a single conductor\n<br>* The definition of the three-phase power supply is, the power flows through three conductors.\n<br>* The single-phase power supply has one distinct wave cycle whereas; three phase has three distinct wave cycles.\n<br>* Single phase requires the single wire to connect the circuit whereas; 3-phase needs 3-wires.\n<br>* The voltage of the single phase is 230V, whereas three phase voltage is 415V.\n<br>* The phase name of the single phase is split phase, whereas three phase has no other name.\n<br>* The capacity of power transfer in the single phase is minimum, whereas three phase has the maximum.\n<br>* The connection of single phase is simple whereas in 3-phase is complicated.\n<br>* The power failure happens in a single phase, but not occurs in three phase.\n<br>* The loss in single phase is maximum whereas in three phase is minimum.\n<br>* The single-phase efficiency is less whereas in three phase is high.\n<br>* The single-phase is inexpensive whereas the 3-phase is expensive.\n<br>* The single-phase AC power supply is utilized for home appliances and three phase power supply is used in huge industries to run heavy loads.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>AC &amp; DC System\n</b><br>There are two systems of electric generation and supply,\n<br>1. Direct current or DC.\n<br>2. Alternating current or AC.\n<br>\n<br><b>Direct Current:</b> it is the kind of electric current that may or may not change the magnitude but the direction of the current will never change.\n<br>E.g. Cells, Batteries and DC Generator.\n<br>\n<br><b>Alternating Current</b>:  it is the kind of electric current, which not only changes its magnitude but also its sign as time passes, in a definite manner.\n<br>This is the current that is supplied by Power station for domestic and commercial use. <br><br><b>Kilowatt hour</b>&nbsp;<br>One kilowatt-hour is equal to the work done or energy consumed when a device of power 1 kW is used for 1 hour.&nbsp;The hour is a unit of time listed among the non-SI units accepted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for use with the SI. Its combination with the kilowatt, a standard SI unit, is therefore permitted within the standard.<br><br><b>Electricity sales\n</b><br>Electrical energy is typically sold to consumers in kilowatt-hours. The cost of running an electrical device is calculated by multiplying the device's power consumption in kilowatts by the operating time in hours, and by the price per kilowatt-hour. The unit price of electricity charged by utility companies may depend on the customer's consumption profile over time. Prices vary considerably by locality. In the United States prices in different states can vary by a factor of three.<br>\n<br>While smaller customer loads are usually billed only for energy, transmission services, and the rated capacity, larger consumers also pay for peak power consumption, the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes. This compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power. These charges are billed as demand changes. Industrial users may also have extra charges according to the power factor of their load.\n<br>\n<br>Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours (TWh) for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year. A 365-day year equals 8,760 hours, so over a period of one year, power of one gigawatt equates to 8.76 terawatt-hours of energy. Conversely, one terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of about 114 megawatts for a period of one year.\n<br>\n<br><b>Examples\n</b><br>An electric heater consuming 1000 watts (1 kilowatt), and operating for one hour uses one kilowatt-hour of energy. A television consuming 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt-hour. A 40-watt electric appliance operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt-hour. In terms of human power, a healthy adult male manual laborer performs work equal to about one half of one kilowatt-hour over an eight-hour day.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

They have contributed significant progress in all different sectors. By pushing the switch or button, you call a metal box that transports you from one floor to another with safely. In fact, an elevator is mandatory for a building which has more than four to five floors high. For most of the people, an elevator offer ease as well as convenience, and also makes life easier for physically handicapped persons. This article discusses what is the elevator, how does it work and types.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is Elevator (Lift)?\n</b><br>An elevator can be defined as an electric lift which is used as vertical transportation of goods as well as people among the floors in buildings using bins otherwise silos. As usual, these are activated with the electrical motors that also to drive counterweight system cables for drive transaction such as a hoist, otherwise, pump hydraulic fluid for raising a cylindrical piston such as a jack.\n<br>\n<br><b>How Does a Lift work?\n</b><br>The working principle of an elevator or lift is similar to the pulley system. A pulley system is used to draw the water from the well. This pulley system can be designed with a bucket, a rope with a wheel. A bucket is connected to a rope that passes throughout a wheel. This can make it very easy to draw the water from the well. Similarly, present elevators use the same concept. But the main difference between these two are; pulley systems are operated manually whereas an elevator uses sophisticated mechanisms for handling the elevator’s load.\n<br>Basically, an elevator is a metal box in different shapes which is connected to a very tough metal rope. The tough metal rope passes through a sheave on the elevator in the engine room. Here a sheave is like a wheel in pulley system for clutching the metal rope strongly. This system can be operated by a motor. When the switch is turned ON, the motor can be activated when the elevator goes up and down or stops.\n<br>The elevator can be constructed with various elevator Components or elevator parts that mainly include speed controlling system, electric motor, rails, cabin, shaft, doors (manual and automatic), drive unit, buffers, and safety device.\n<br>\n<br><b>Different Types of Elevator\n</b><br>The different types of lifts or elevators include building lift, capsule lift, hydraulic elevator, pneumatic elevator, passenger lift, freight elevator, traction elevator/cable driven, residential elevators, machine room-less elevator, etc.\n<br><br><b>1) Hydraulic Elevator\n</b><br>A hydraulic elevator is power-driven by a piston that moves within a cylinder. The piston movement can be done by pumping hydraulic oil to the cylinder. The piston lifts the lift cab easily, and the oil can be controlled by an electrical valve.\n<br>The applications of hydraulic elevators involve in five to six-floor buildings. The operating of these elevators can be done at speeds up to 200 ft or 61 meters for each minute. All the current hydraulic pumps are designed with a mechanical Y-delta starter otherwise solid state contractor. For the power supply of motor as well as building, solid-state starters are superior. Because the winding stay longer as well as there is no voltage drop across the building power supply.  In Y-delta type starter, the motor can be activated by using two contractors on a decreased speed, after that continues with full speed. Older hydraulic elevators now started up suddenly, transmitting mains power at full-blast right into the electric motor. This sets a lot of damage on the motor, which will make it burn out quicker than motors on Solid-State or Y-Delta Contactor starters. The hydraulic elevators are classified into four types such as holed, hole less &amp; roped elevators \n<br>\n<br><b>2) Pneumatic Elevator\n</b><br>The pneumatic elevator can be designed with an external cylinder, and the cylinder is a crystal clear self-supporting cylinder. This cylinder includes modular sections to fit effortlessly into one by one. The top of this tube is designed with steel material that ensures tight air shutting by suction valves as well as inlets. A lift car runs within the cylinder, &amp; the head unit on the top cylinder surface consists of valves, controllers, and turbines for controlling the elevator movements.\n<br>Pneumatic elevators are very easy to fit, operate as well as maintain when compared with the traditional elevators. These are used in existing homes because of their solid design. The main benefits of using these elevators include solid design &amp; smooth, speed and flexibility, energy efficient and very safe.\n<br>\n<br><b>3) Cable Driven or Traction Elevator\n</b><br>The traction elevator or cable driven elevators are the most popular elevators. It consists of steel cables as well as hoisting ropes that run above a pulley which is connected to the motor. This is geared otherwise gear-less-traction type elevator. In this kind of elevator, several wire and hoisting cables are connected to the surface of an elevator car with covering around it on sheaves at one end &amp; the other side is connected to a counterweight that travels up &amp; down on its guide rails. The counterweight is equivalent to the car’s weight and half of the weight of the passenger in the car. This means, throughout the lifting process it needs extra power for the additional passengers in the car; the rest of the load is managed with the weight of the counter. When the control system is connected to the lift, then it drives the motors in a frontward way, and sheave turns around to move the car lift upwards and stops in the preferred floor where the car is controlled by the weight of the counter. \n<br>For the car downstairs movement, overturn occurs during a rotating motor through a control method. For conserving the energy, some types of lift use electric motors with four quadrant operation in the regenerative method. Because of the high rise as well as high-speed capacities, these are applicable in several escalators, lifts, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>4) Capsule Lift\n</b><br>Capsule lift or Elevators are used in prestigious buildings, which can be called as decoration of a building because they improve the building’s beauty as well as carries life into it.\n<br>The main features of this elevators mainly include design, and travel comfort is best. The interior design of these lifts is attractive with a large glass panel for viewing. The ultramodern design of these lifts offers a cosmic zone travel experience for the passengers. These lifts are consistent and inexpensive with the least maintenance.\n<br>\n<br><b>5) Building Lift\n</b><br>A building lift is a vertical transportation among the floors of the building. These are frequently used in public buildings, complexes, offices, and multistory building. These lifts are important in providing vertical movement, mostly in high buildings, for a wheelchair as well as other non-ambulant building customers. Some type of lifts also is applicable for emigration &amp; firefighting purposes.\n<br>\n<br><b>6) Passenger Lift\n</b><br>This type of lift has entirely included a lift car that moves vertically in a specially equipped lift shaft. Passengers are traveled between the floors in the building at quick speed. The control systems in the lift frequently designed to offer the most economical sharing of passengers all over the building. These lifts are very space efficient which are used in existing buildings where space is at a best.\n<br>The main advantages of using passenger lift give a very comfort traveling among different floors, particularly space efficient, fully fixed shaft, small construction works, and no level loading on the building.\n<br>\n<br><b>7) Freight Elevator</b>\n<br>In the world of elevators, these lifts are workhorses. These are very useful for transporting materials, goods in warehouses, manufacturing industries, shopping malls, seaports, etc. This type of elevator is separated into classes, to describe their load capacity as well as application. These lifts are strong in nature, and they are specially manufactured by engineers.\n<br>The features of this elevator include: the range of loading capacity is from 2500 lbs to 10000 lbs, height of the travel up to 50fts. The benefits of these elevators include; these elevators are designed for commercial as well as industrial applications. The flexible design to hold the application, door designs can be changed, eco-friendly, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>8) Residential Elevators\n</b><br>Residential elevators provide stylish options to the platform as well as stair lifts. These lifts can be effortlessly incorporated in any available home, otherwise incorporated in edifice plans for latest homes. These types of elevators are available in different styles, and these can be installed in your home walls, otherwise included effortlessly to improve your home’s decoration. The main benefits of residential elevators are; they can move you securely among floors even during a power failure. Quick installation and offers you an effortless life.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Escalator Working principle:\n</b><br>\n<br>1. The core parts of the escalator are two chains, which rotate around two pairs of gears. At the top of the escalator, an electric motor drives the transmission gear to rotate the chain ring. A typical escalator USES a 100 horsepower engine to turn the gears. The engine and chain systems are mounted in trusses, which are metal structures that extend from floor to floor.\n<br>2. Unlike the conveyor belt moving a plane, the chain ring moves a set of steps. The most interesting thing about escalators is the way they move. The steps remain level as the chain moves. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the steps fold into a platform. This makes it easier to get up and down the escalator.\n<br>3. Each step of the escalator has two sets of wheels, which rotate along two separate tracks. The top gear (wheels near the top of the steps) is connected to a rotating chain and is pulled by a drive gear located at the top of the escalator. The other wheels simply slide along the track behind the first wheels.\n<br>4. The two tracks are separated from each other, so that each step can be kept level. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the track is in a horizontal position, flattening the steps. There are a series of grooves inside each step to connect the front and rear steps during the leveling process.\n<br>5. Besides rotating the main link, the motor in the escalator can also move the handrails. The armrest is just a rubber conveyor belt that circulates around a series of wheels. The conveyor belt is precisely configured to move at exactly the same speed as the steps, making the rider feel smooth.\n<br>6. The escalator system is not capable of lifting people up dozens of floors as elevators do, but it is suitable for providing short distance transportation. This is because of the high load rate of escalators. When the elevator is full, no one else can get on until it reaches the designated floor and returns. On escalators, as long as one person reaches the top, it makes room for others.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Hence appropriate and efficient building transport systems are not only important but necessary also for operation.The systems should be a mix of manual and automatic operations. \n<br>\n<br>There are two types of building transport system namely Vertical Transport System and Horizontal Transport System.\n<br>\n<br><b>A. Vertical Transport System\n</b><br>1. Stairs\n<br>2. Elevators / Lifts\n<br>3. Escalators (Moving Stairs)\n<br>4. Gravity Chutes (for goods)\n<br>5. Dumbwaiter<br>\n<br><b>Stairs\n</b><br>This is the most common and essential for vertical movement of people and goods. It is also mandatory as it is an escape route in case of fire in buildings. In case of power failure, lifts do not operate and hence stair case is the only alternative for vertical movement. It must be fire proof so that guests can safely exit to upper and lower building floors. Provision of hand rails and non-slip steps are recommended for safety purpose.\n<br><br><b>Elevators\n</b><br>An elevator is a transportation device used to transport people and goods vertically. Elevators are generally automatic safety units for up and down transport purpose. It consists of a platform travelling in vertical guides in a shaft with hoisting and lowering mechanism and a source of power. The enclosure moving up and down in the guides is known as car.\n<br>There are two types of lift systems.\n<br>* Cable elevators – They are more common because they are fast, smooth and quite.\n<br>* Hydraulic elevators - are elevators which are powered by a piston that travels inside a cylinder. An electric motor pumps hydraulic oil into the cylinder to move the piston. The piston smoothly lifts the elevator cab/car. They are used when the number of floors to be serviced is less. The elevators require regular inspection and maintenance and generally have a life of 20 years.\n<br><br><b>Escalators\n</b><br>The term escalator is a combination of elevator and “scala” the latin word for steps. Escalators are the moving step type lifts operating at constant speed between two levels in an inclined course for moving large number of people in a short time. It consists of a staircase whose steps move up and down on tracks which keep them horizontal. Most escalators also have a moving handrail which approximately keeps pace with the movement of the steps. The direction of movement (up and down) can be permanently the same or can be controlled by operators according to the requirement. Generally two units are required side-by-side at each level, one moving upward and the other downward.\n<br>Gravity Chutes\n<br>Gravity chutes are used by hotels for transporting soiled linen, garbage and waste from different floors of the hotel to an outlet point (generally kept on the ground floor). It is an efficient system as minimum power is involved in operating it. Gravity chutes save workers motion, time and increase their productivity.\n<br><br><b>Dumbwaiter</b><br>A dumbwaiter is a small freight elevator or lift intended to carry food. Dumbwaiters found within modern structures, including both commercial, public and private buildings, are often connected between multiple floors. When installed in restaurants, schools, hospitals, retirement homes or in private homes, the lifts generally terminate in a kitchen.<br><br><b><i>a) Hand Operated Dumbwaiters</i></b>\n<br>\n<br>Hand operated dumbwaiters, as you might have guessed, are operated manually.  You operate the controls yourself in order to raise or lower the dumbwaiter.  They are surprisingly easy to use as they have an intricate combination of gears, brakes, and counterbalances which means you need to use very little effort and they are also very safe.  The automatic brake system that is included means that you’ll never accidentally drop the dumbwaiter as you are using it!  hand operated dumbwaiters have operating capacities of between 25 kilograms and 300 kilograms so you are sure to find one that suits your needs. They generally come in standardised sizes but you can have them custom made if you need.\n<br><br><b><i>b) Electrically Operated Dumbwaiters\n</i></b><br>Electrically operated dumbwaiters are nearly foolproof as they operate with just the push of a button. They use either the standard 240 volts, or they can operate using 415 volts.  Three phase power is most commonly required but single phase power options are becoming more common.  The equipment necessary to operate the dumbwaiter such as the motor, controller, gearbox and pulleys is hidden in a control box.  In some cases, the motor and equipment will need to be below floor level but many modern dumbwaiters have an all in one shaft so there is no need to excavate the fit the motor in.<br><br><b><i>* Window Type Dumbwaiter</i></b> – these are our most popular option. They’re small goods lifts that are installed at chest height for easily loading goods by hand. They’re most often used for the transport of food from the kitchens to the table, goods from the warehouse to the store, and books, or documents from one floor to another.\n<br><b><i>* Floor Type Dumbwaiter</i></b> – these are installed where there are goods that need to be loaded onto a forklift, or pallet truck. They are most often used for the movement of bulky items such as laundry, furniture for public events, or boxes of documentation for conference venues.\n<br><b><i>* Goods Lift Dumbwaiter</i></b> – this is a larger model, and it looks more like a traditional elevator. It features a modular structure with a self-supporting design, which means it’s easy to install as it doesn’t need a pit and shaft. The controls are on the outside because these lifts are not designed to carry people under any circumstances.<b><br></b><br><br><b>B. Horizontal Transport System\n</b><br>1. Conveyor belts (moving sidewalk, moving walk way or travellator)\n<br>2. Electric cars\n<br>3. Manual trolley for transportation of luggage.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Travellators (Moving pavements)\n</i></b><br>Travellators also known as horizontal moving sidewalks, moving walkways is a slow speed conveyor belt to transport people, they can walk along or stand on it.\n<br>They are often installed in pairs, for movement in opposite direction. Travellators may be used when there is substantial distance between the hotel entry point and the reception point.\n<br><b><i>Electric Cars</i></b>\n<br>Electric car is an electrically operated open car with 6 to 8 seats. This is an alternative to travellators and particularly very useful for disabled persons.\n<br><b><i>Manual Trolley\n</i></b><br>Manual trolley is used for transportation of luggage of guest.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Piece Work or Piece Rate Contract\n<br>2. Lump Sum Rate Contract\n<br>3. Rate Contract\n<br>4. Service Contract\n<br>5. Multi Stage Contract\n<br>\n<br><b>Possible Circumstances for availing Contract Maintenance\n</b><br>• While contract maintenance may cover all possible types of maintenance including routine, preventive an corrective maintenance, some specific areas or circumstances might require contract maintenance as mentioned below.\n<br>• Contract Maintenance may handle special needs of a property involving special equipment's or when such needs are infrequent in nature ie. Fire Extinguishers, Lifts, Fire Alarm Systems, Detectors, Sensors etc.\n<br>• Contract Maintenance may be called upon for routine services such as janitorial services for all sorts of building interior cleaning.\n<br>• Ground maintenance and special maintenance needs like pest control activities (needing license from IPCA) are generally awarded to contract maintenance.\n<br>• In many properties, operation and maintenance of water treatment, sewage treatment and swimming pool maintenance are left to contract service owing to their very sophisticated nature.\n<br>• At small establishments, air – conditioning and refrigeration units are also maintained through contract service.\n<br>• Special equipment's are often needed for cleaning kitchen ducting, grease trap, grease filters etc., and their maintenance is also often contracted out.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of the Maintenance Department in Contract Maintenance\n</b><br>1. Apart from identifying the areas that need to be brought under contract maintenance and choosing an appropriate contractor the Chief Engineer has to also ensure the following.\n<br>2. The contract has to carefully framed to clearly define the definite area of work to perform.\n<br>3. The Maintenance department has to closely monitor and control the reliability and quality of maintenance being carried out by them.\n<br>4. Periodic review is to be made to ascertain the need of any change in the nature of the contract including a possible change in the contractor.\n<br>5. The access to the property in areas other than the area of work should be restricted for the employees of the contractor.\n<br>6. Behavioral Issues\n<br>7. The Chief Engineer has to ensure that the contractor is following required safety standards for their employees and they are covered by appropriate insurance policies.\n<br>\n<br><b>ADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE\n</b><br>• Reduction of total labour cost.\n<br>• Reduction of cost of carrying inventory and special maintenance equipment.\n<br>• Use of latest techniques and methods of maintenance.\n<br>• Saving in administrative time on the part of the engineers when they can concentrate more on planning, etc.\n<br>• Structure and infrastructural facilities of the in-house maintenance department need not change due to introduction of new equipment's with sophisticated technology.\n<br>• Flexibility to meet emergencies\n<br>• Reduction of labour problem.\n<br>• Need to recruit and train employees is eliminated.\n<br>\n<br><b>DISADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE \n</b><br>• Labour cost is not really saved unless the actual number of in-house maintenance staff is reduced.\n<br>• Revision of contract fees in subsequent years often leads to escalation of total cost if not properly negotiated and controlled.\n<br>• Often the specialized nature of the maintenance would lead to high charges for such contracts leading to a overall increase in maintenance cost compared to if it were maintained in house.\n<br>• At the time of bidding, lack of initiative on the part of the Chief Engineer would often lead to a non-competitive price quote by a handful on contractors.\n<br>• Reduction in the number of specialized in-house maintenance crew may result in their unavailability in case of an emergency requirement for some other facility.\n<br>• The Chief Engineer does not get any information feedback regarding the status of the equipment under contract maintenance, except in case when it completely breaks down.\n<br>• Loss of control over contractor employees.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Many of the licenses and registrations must be obtained prior to starting the hotel and renewed while the hotel is operational. Further, most licenses require the hotel to meet certain rules or criteria’s for maintaining validity. Therefore, it is important for Entrepreneurs in the hotel industry to be aware of these licenses and registrations – to operate a hotel business smoothly.\n<br>A lot of the license requirements depend on the type of hotel, star rating, amenities and the location of the hotel. Further, the rules and regulations to obtain license for hotel industry differs according to the states.\n<br>\n<br><b>Building Permit\n</b><br>The National Building Code of India was prepared by the Bureau of Indian Standards to unify the building regulations throughout the country. The National Building Code is adopted by all Government Departments, Municipal Bodies and other Construction Agencies. As per the National Building Code, no person shall carry out any development, erect, re-erect or make alterations or demolish any building or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for each such development/building from the Authority. Therefore, all hotels must have a proper building permit as per the relevant Town Planning Act or Development Act or Municipal Act or any other applicable statutes for layout, building plans, water supply, sewerage, drainage, electrification, etc,.\n<br>\n<br><b>Fire Safety Permit\n</b><br>A fire safety certificate or permit is required for the Fire Department is a must for operating a hotel business. Fire safety certificate is usually provided if the building has incorporated proper fire prevention and fire safety measures as required under the relevant fire safety rules and regulations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Police License for Hotel\n</b><br>Hotels are public places that are monitored closely by the Police Department. Therefore, all hotels must maintain proper log of all Guests who have stayed at the hotel, follow relevant regulations and maintain a valid permit from the Police Department. Police license for hotels usually falls under the power of licensing of Places of Public Entertainment held by Commissioner or Additional Commissioner of Police.\n<br>\n<br><b>Health Trade License or Trade License\n</b><br>A health trade license is usually required from the local Health Department for restaurants and hotels. Health trade licenses are usually issued by the Municipal Corporation. The health trade license is required for businesses that have a direct impact on public health. Compliance with the relevant hygiene and safety norms, which are important for public health is a prerequisite for issuance of a health trade license.\n<br>\n<br><b>Business Registration\n</b><br>It is recommended that a hotel be setup under an artificial legal entity like company or LLP. By operating a company under an artificial legal entity, the liability of the promoters with respect to the business can be limited and the business as a going concern would be easily transferable to another person.\n<br>\n<br><b>ESI Registration\n<br>E</b>SI is an autonomous corporation under Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India. Employee’s State Insurance (ESI) registration is mandatory in India for Businesses that employ 10 or more employees. To maintain compliance with the ESI Regulations, the employer must contribute 4.75% of the wages for all employees earning Rs.15,000 or less toward ESI employer dues. The employee is required to contribute 1.75% of his/her wages as ESI dues.\n<br>\n<br><b>PF Registration</b>\n<br>A Employee Provident Fund (PF) Registration is required for any establishment that employs more than 20 persons in India. The PF Board administers a contributory provident fund, pension scheme and an insurance scheme for the workforce engaged in the organized sector in India.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bar License\n</b><br>If the hotel operates a bar or serves alcohol in the restaurants, a Bar license will be required from the relevant authorities. Bar license is usually provided by departments operating under the State Government. Hence, the requirement for bar license varies from state to state.\n<br>\n<br><b>FSSAI Food Business License\n</b><br>A FSSAI food business license under the Food Safety and Standard Act is required for operating a restaurant in India. The FSSAI food business license is usually provided for one year and is renewal at the end of each year. FSSAI license for restaurants are managed by the local FSSAI office. FSSAI license for restaurants does not fall under the purview of the Central Government.\n<br>\n<br><b>Service Tax Registration (After GST, Not Applicable)</b>\n<br>Service tax is applicable on the accommodation services provided by the hotel and food services provided by a restaurant in the hotel. Therefore, hotels must obtain and maintain service tax registration. Hotels having room Tariff of Rs. 1000/- and above have to pay the service tax on 60% of room tariff at 14% (the net rate of Service Tax comes to 8.4%). For restaurants, the service tax is applicable on 40% of the Food and Beverages bill @ 14% (the net rate of service tax comes to 5.6%). Further, the use of banquet hall where substantial food is served attracts service tax @ 14% with abatement of 30%(the net rate of service tax comes to 9.8%).\n<br>\n<br><b>GST Registration\n</b><br>Under the new GST rates, Non-AC restaurants will be charged at 12%, while AC restaurants will be charged at 18%. 5-Star restaurants will be charged a Luxury Tax of a whopping 28%. Restaurants with a turnover less than 50 lakh INR heave a sigh of relief, as they would be levied a GST rate of 5%.\n<br>Hotels and lodges having tariff less than 1000 INR will be taxed at 5%, while those between 1000-2500 will be charged at 12%. Hotels between 2500-5000 will be charged at 18%, and hotels having tariff above 5000 will be considered luxury hotels and charged at 28%.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Note:</i></b> According to the recent ruling by the government, both AC and Non-AC restaurants will be levied a GST tax of 5%. The restaurants in 5-star hotels that charge Rs 7500 per day will be levied 18% GST. <br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Chlorpyrifos 20 EC\n<br>2. Lindane 20 EC\n<br>\n<br>The above-mentioned chemicals are used in water emulsion for the treatment of soil in order to protect a building from termite attack. For the treatment of wood, oil or kerosene-based solution of the mentioned chemicals with 1.0% concentration is used.\n<br>\n<br><b>Pre-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>The procedure for pre-construction anti-termite treatment is given below –\n<br>1. For the excavation made for foundation, the sides and the bottom surface of the foundation trenches and pits are treated with an anti-termite chemical to a height of about 30cm at the rate of 5 Lit. per square meter of surface area.\n<br>2. For flooring, the earth surface is firstly cleaned from wooden and any other garbage particles.\n<br>3. The entire surface should be levelled to the required elevation.\n<br>4. Holes of 30 cm depth at an interval of 15 cm are made.\n<br>5. An emulsion of correct concentration (as mentioned in manufacturer’s specification) shall be made by adding water to the chemical.\n<br>6. This emulsion shall be poured in the holes by pouring jars and sprayed on the surface by using pressure pumps and sprayers.\n<br>7. The chemical is allowed to get soaked through the holes fully.\n<br>Note: The anti-termite treatment must be done by an approved specialized agency for termite-prone areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Pre-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Less Expensive\n<br>The steps involved in Pre-construction treatment are lesser when compared to post-construction treatment. Thus the cost of the anti-termite is less.\n<br>2. Fewer Obstacles\n<br>The number of obstacles in case of Pre-construction anti-termite treatment is lesser. Major components of buildings like walls, which gives better access to every nook and corner of the buildings without any obstacles.\n<br>3. Prevention is Better than Cure\n<br>Opting for post-construction anti-termite treatment can be late as the termites might have already started doing some sort of destruction to the foundation, walls or the wooden attachments in your home. To eradicate the termite infestation from its root, pre-construction treatment is recommended.\n<br>\n<br><b>Post-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Inspection\n<br>Before undertaking any type of treatment, a thorough inspection shall be made of the infestation in the building with a view of determining the extent to which it has spread, and the routes of entry of termites into the building.\n<br>2. Extermination of Termites in Building\n<br>The inspection of the infestation gives the location of termites. The extermination inside the building shall be carried out in a thorough manner, seeking the termites in their hideouts, such as ceilings behind wooden paneling's, inside electrical wiring battens, conduits, switchboards and similar locations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Preventive Measures\n</b><br>1. The primary function of soil treatment is to establish a chemical barrier between the termites in the soil and the building to be protected.\n<br>2. To treat the soil outside of foundations, the soil in contact with the external wall of the building shall be treated with the chemical emulsion at the rate of 7.5 lit/Sqm of the vertical surface of the substructure to a depth of 300 mm.\n<br>3. The termites seek their way inside the building floor through the cracks or voids at the following locations –\n<br>(a) At the junction of the floor and walls as a result of shrinkage of the concrete.\n<br>(b) Cracks formed on the floor surface due to construction defects.\n<br>(c) At construction joints and expansion joints in a concrete floor.\n<br>4. Chemical treatment should be done in the building area of the ground floor wherever the cracks are noticed. This is done by drilling vertically 12 mm holes at the junction of floor and walls, constructional and expansion joints mentioned above at 300 mm interval to reach the soil below.\n<br>5. Treatment for wood is done at the points of contact of the woodwork. All the locations where the woodwork in the building is in contact with the woodwork must be treated with anti-termite treatment.\n<br>6. This is done by spraying at the points of contacts with the adjoining masonry with the chemical emulsion of concentration by drilling 6mm holes at a downward angle of about 45° at the junction of woodwork and masonry.\n<br>7. Treatment of electrical fixtures such as switch boxes in the wall is done by removing the outer coverings and treating the internal parts with 5 percent Malathion dusting powder.\n<br>\n<br><b>Safety</b>\n<br>1. All works shall comply with the safety procedure or instruction as set out in project safety plan and municipality rules and regulations.\n<br>2. Basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shall be worn by all staff or laborers.\n<br>3. All operatives shall be inducted before entering the site.\n<br>\n<b><br>Advantages of Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. It provides immediate protection to any structure from termites, rodents, and pests.\n<br>2. It lasts for several years.\n<br>3. It eliminates the problem of gaps forming in the protection barrier, allowing termites to enter the home.\n<br>4. Liquid termiticides are relatively inexpensive when compared to other forms of termite control.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages of Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Anti-Termite treatment can lead to water contamination in areas close to waterways or wetlands.\n<br>2. Drilling into areas that show evidence of termite entry, or concrete may be necessary, which can reduce the strength of the member or structure.\n<br>3. Any small negligence or left out portion can lead to problems with an infestation in future.\n<br>\n<br><b>Maintain the Termite Prevention Features\n</b><br>• After construction, keep the soil around the foundation dry through proper grading and drainage (including maintenance of gutters and downspouts).\n<br>• Reduce openings that offer termites access to the structure (filling cracks in cement foundations as well as around where utilities pass through the wall with cement, grout, or caulk).\n<br>• Fix leaks immediately.\n<br>• Keep vents free from blockage, including plants.\n<br>• Ensure that trees and shrubs are not planted too close to the structure and do not allow them to grow against exposed wood surfaces.\n<br>• Do not pile or store firewood or wood debris next to the house.\n<br>• Inspect periodically to help ensure that termite colonies do not become established.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

FRAME TYPE CONSTRUCTION\n<br>B. LOAD BEARING MASONRY WALL CONSTRUCTION\n<br>C. PRE ENGINEERED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION\n<br>D. LIGHT GAUGE STEEL STRUCTURES\n<br>\n<br><b>A. FRAME TYPE CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br><i>1.CONCRETE FRAME CONSTRUCTION\n</i><br>Concrete frame construction is probably the most common kind of construction system used in the world today. As the name suggests, this has a skeleton of concrete, that is covered in a skin. The skin can be made of brick, aluminium or glass, and is attached to the outer surface of the building.\n<br><i>2.STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</i><br>Steel is an immensely strong and flexible material. This is why steel frame structures are ideal for earthquake-prone areas.\n<br><i>3.WOOD FRAMED CONSTRUCTION\n</i><br>Wood framed construction is widely used for residential and low-rise structures in North America and Europe.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. LOAD BEARING MASONRY WALL CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Load bearing masonry walls is a form of construction that was used widely from the 1700s to the mid-1900s. It consists of heavy brick or stone walls that support horizontal floor slabs.\n<br>\n<br><b>C. PRE ENGINEERED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</b>\n<br>Pre-engineered metal buildings are a fast, economical type of construction best suited to warehouses and industrial buildings.\n<br>\n<br><b>D.LIGHT GAUGE STEEL STRUCTURES</b>\n<br>Light gauge steel construction is very widely used for residential and low-rise buildings in the US and Europe. It is very similar to light wood construction.\n<br>\n<br><b>1.CONCRETE FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Concrete frame structures are a very common - or perhaps the most common- type of modern building internationally. As the name suggests, this type of building consists of a frame or skeleton of concrete. Horizontal members of this frame are called beams, and vertical members are called columns. Humans walk on flat planes of concrete called slabs (see figure at the bottom of the page for an illustration of each of the major parts of a frame structure). Of these, the column is the most important, as it is the primary load-carrying element of the building . If you damage a beam or slab in a building, this will affect only one floor, but damage to a column could bring down the entire building.\n<br>When we say concrete in the building trade, we actually mean reinforced concrete. Its full name is reinforced cement concrete, or RCC. RCC is concrete that contains steel bars, called reinforcement bars, or re bars. This combination works very well, as concrete is very strong in compression, easy to produce at site, and inexpensive, and steel is very very strong in tension. To make reinforced concrete, one first makes a mold, called form work, that will contain the liquid concrete and give it the form and shape we need. Then one looks at the structural engineer's drawings and places in the steel reinforcement bars, and ties them in place using wire. The tied steel is called a reinforcement cage, because it is shaped like one.\n<br>Once the steel is in place, one can start to prepare the concrete, by mixing cement, sand, stone chips in a range of sizes, and water in a cement mixer, and pouring in the liquid concrete into the form work till exactly the right level is reached. The concrete will become hard in a matter of hours, but takes a month to reach its full strength. Therefore it is usually propped up until that period. During this time the concrete must be cured, or supplied with water on its surface, which it needs for the chemical reactions within to proceed properly.\n<br>Working out the exact 'recipe', or proportions of each ingredient is a science in itself. It is called concrete mix design. A good mix designer will start with the properties that are desired in the mix, then take many factors into account, and work out a detailed mix design. A site engineer will often order a different type of mix for a different purpose. For example, if he is casting a thin concrete wall in a hard-to-reach area, he will ask for a mix that is more flow able than stiff. This will allow the liquid concrete to flow by gravity into every corner of the form work. For most construction applications, however, a standard mix is used.\n<br>Common examples of standard mixes are M20, M30, M40 concrete, where the number refers to the strength of the concrete in n/mm2 or newtons per square millimeter. Therefore M30 concrete will have a comprehensive strength of 30 n/mm2. A standard mix may also specify the maximum aggregate size. Aggregates are the stone chips used in concrete. If an engineer specifies M30 / 20 concrete, he wants M30 concrete with a maximum aggregate size of 20mm. He does NOT want concrete with a strength of between 20-30 n/mm2, which is a common misinterpretation in some parts of the world.\n<br>So the structure is actually a connected frame of members, each of which are firmly connected to each other. In engineering parlance, these connections are called moment connections, which means that the two members are firmly connected to each other. There are other types of connections, including hinged connections, which are used in steel structures, but concrete frame structures have moment connections in 99.9% of cases. This frame becomes very strong, and must resist the various loads that act on a building during its life.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>These loads include:\n</i></b><br>    * Dead Loads: the downwards force on the building coming from the weight of the building itself, including the structural elements, walls, facades, and the like.\n<br>    * Live Loads: the downwards force on the building coming from the expected weight of the occupants and their possessions, including furniture, books, and so on. Normally these loads are specified in building codes and structural engineers must design buildings to carry these or greater loads. These loads will vary with the use of the space, for example, whether it is residential, office, industrial to name a few. It is common for codes to require live loads for residential to be a minimum of about 200 kg/m2, offices to be 250 kg/m2, and industrial to be 1000 kg/m2, which is the same as 1T/m2. These live loads are sometimes called imposed loads.\n<br>    * Dynamic Loads: these occur commonly in bridges and similar infrastructure, and are the loads created by traffic, including braking and accelerating loads.\n<br>    * Wind Loads: This is a very important design factor, especially for tall buildings, or buildings with large surface area. Buildings are designed not to resist the everyday wind conditions, but extreme conditions that may occur once every 100 years or so. These are called design wind speeds, and are specified in building codes. A building can commonly be required to resist a wind force of 150 kg/m2, which can be a very significant force when multiplied by the surface area of the building.\n<br>    * Earthquake Loads: in an earthquake, the ground vigorously shakes the building both horizontally and vertically, rather like a bucking horse shakes a rider in the sport of rodeo. This can cause the building to fall apart. The heavier the building, the greater the force on it. Its important to note that both wind and earthquake impose horizontal forces on the building, unlike the gravity forces it normally resists, which are vertical in direction.\n<br>The concrete frame rests on foundations, which transfer the forces - from the building and on the building - to the ground. Some other important components of concrete frame structures are:\n<br>Shear Walls are important structural elements in high-rise buildings. Shear walls are essentially very large columns - they could easily measure 400mm thick by 3m long - making them appear like walls rather than columns. Their function in a building is to help take care of horizontal forces on buildings like wind and earthquake loads. Normally, buildings are subject to vertical loads - gravity. Shear walls also carry vertical loads. It is important to understand that they only work for horizontal loads in one direction - the axis of the long dimension of the wall. These are usually not required in low-rise structures.\n<br>Elevator Shafts are vertical boxes in which the elevators move up and down - normally each elevator is enclosed in its own concrete box. These shafts are also very good structural elements, helping to resist horizontal loads, and also carrying vertical loads.\n<br>\n<br><i><b>WALLS IN CONCRETE FRAME BUILDINGS</b>\n</i><br>Concrete frame structures are strong and economical. Hence almost any walling materials can be used with them. The heavier options include masonry walls of brick, concrete block, or stone. The lighter options include drywall partitions made of light steel or wood studs covered with sheeting boards. The former are used when strong, secure, and sound-proof enclosures are required, and the latter when quick, flexible lightweight partitions are needed.When brick or concrete blocks are used, it is common to plaster the entire surface - brick and concrete - with a cement plaster to form a hard, long-lasting finish.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>CLADDING OF CONCRETE FRAME STRUCTURES\n</i></b><br>Concrete frame buildings can be clad with any kind of cladding material. Common cladding materials are glass, aluminium panels, stone sheets, and ceramic facades. Since these structures can be designed for heavy loading, one could even clad them in solid masonry walls of brick or stone.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Most steel construction is done with a type of steel called mild steel. Mild steel is a material that is immensely strong. Take a circular bar of steel 1 inch / 25mm in diameter. If you were to attach this bar securely to your ceiling, you could hang from it 20,000 Kg (which is 20 tons), This immense strength is of great advantage to buildings. The other important feature of steel framing is its flexibility. It can bend without cracking, which is another great advantage, as a steel building can flex when it is pushed to one side by say, wind, or an earthquake. The third characteristic of steel is its plasticity or ductility. This means that when subjected to great force, it will not suddenly crack like glass, but slowly bend out of shape. This property allows steel buildings to bend out of shape, or deform, thus giving warning to inhabitants to escape. Failure in steel frames is not sudden - a steel structure rarely collapses. Steel in most cases performs far better in earthquake than most other materials because of these properties.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>WHERE STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES ARE USED</i></b>\n<br>Steel construction is most often used in\n<br>● High rise buildings because of its strength, low weight, and speed of construction\n<br>● Industrial buildings because of its ability to create large span spaces at low cost\n<br>● Warehouse buildings for the same reason\n<br>● Residential buildings in a technique called light gauge steel construction\n<br>● Temporary Structures as these are quick to set up and remove\n<br>\n<br><b><i>TYPES OF STEEL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION\n</i></b><br>There are several types of steel building construction. Steel construction is also called steel fabrication.\n<br>Conventional Steel Fabrication is when teams of steel fabricators cut members of steel to the correct lengths, and then weld them together to make the final structure. This can be done entirely at the construction site, which is labour-intensive, or partially in a workshop, to provide better working conditions and reduce time.\n<br>Bolted Steel Construction occurs when steel fabricators produce finished and painted steel components, which are then shipped to the site and simply bolted in place. This is the preferred method of steel construction, as the bulk of the fabrication can be done in workshops, with the right machinery, lighting, and work conditions. The size of the components are governed by the size of the truck or trailer they are shipped in, usually with a max length of 6m (20ft) for normal trucks or 12m (40ft) for long trailers. Since the only work to be done at site is lifting the steel members into place (with cranes) and bolting, the work at site is tremendously fast. Pre-engineered buildings are an example of bolted steel construction that is designed, fabricated, shipped and erected by one company to the owner.\n<br>Light Gauge Steel Construction is a type of construction that is common for residential and small buildings in North America and parts of Europe. This is similar to wood framed construction, except that light gauge steel members are used in place of wood two-by-fours. Light gauge steel is steel that is in the form of thin (1-3mm) sheets of steel that have been bent into shape to form C-sections or Z-sections.\n<br>\n<br><b>WEIGHT OF STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Consider a single storey building measuring 5 x 8m (16 x 26ft). Let us first construct this in concrete, with four columns at the corners, beams spanning between the columns, and a 150mm (6\") thick concrete slab at the top. Such a structure would weigh about 800 kg/m2, or 32 Tons (32,000 kg) in total. If we build this of steel instead, with a sloping roof covered with corrugated metal sheeting with insulation, this would weigh only about 65 kg/m2. The steel framed building will weigh only 2.6 Tons (2,600 kg). So the concrete building is over 12 times heavier! This is for single storey structures - in multi-storey structures, the difference will be less, as the floors in multi-storey steel buildings are built of concrete slabs for economy - but the difference is still significant.\n<br>This low weight of steel frame buildings means that they have to be firmly bolted to the foundations to resist wind forces, else they could be blown away like deck umbrellas!\n<br>\n<br><b><i>ADVANTAGES OF STEEL STRUCTURES</i></b>\n<br>Steel structures have the following advantages:\n<br>● They are super-quick to build at site, as a lot of work can be pre-fabbed at the factory.\n<br>● They are flexible, which makes them very good at resisting dynamic (changing) forces such as wind or earthquake forces.\n<br>● A wide range of ready-made structural sections are available, such as I, C, and angle sections\n<br>● They can be made to take any kind of shape, and clad with any type of material\n<br>● A wide range of joining methods is available, such as bolting, welding, and riveting\n<br>\n<br><b><i>DISADVANTAGES OF STEEL STRUCTURES\n</i></b><br>Steel structures have the following disadvantages:\n<br>● They lose strength at high temperatures, and are susceptible to fire.\n<br>● They are prone to corrosion in humid or marine environments.\n<br>\n<br><b>C.WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Light wood framed construction is one of the most popular types of building methods for homes in the United States and parts of Europe. It has the following characteristics:\n<br>1. It is light, and allows quick construction with no heavy tools or equipment. Every component can easily be carried by hand - a house essentially becomes a large carpentry job. The main tool is a handheld nail gun.\n<br>2. It is able to adapt itself to any geometric shape, and can be clad with a variety of materials.\n<br>3. There are a huge variety of products and systems tailored to this type of construction.\n<br>It has these negative characteristics:\n<br>1. It is not highly fireproof, as it is made of wood.\n<br>2. It is not strong enough to resist major wind events such as tornadoes and hurricanes.\n<br>Every timber frame home structure is made of a few basic components:\n<br>Studs are vertical wooden members within the walls.\n<br>Joists are the horizontal wooden beams that support the floors.\n<br>Rafters are the sloping wooden beams that support the roof.\n<br>Sheathing are the sheets that are nailed over the studs to connect them securely and form the wall surfaces.\n<br>Siding is the exterior cladding that covers the walls from the outside.\n<br>\n<br><b>D. LOAD BEARING MASONRY CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Load bearing masonry construction was the most widely used form of construction for large buildings from the 1700s to the mid-1900s. It is very rarely used today for large buildings, but smaller residential-scale structures are being built. It essentially consists of thick, heavy masonry walls of brick or stone that support the entire structure, including the horizontal floor slabs, which could be made of reinforced concrete, wood, or steel members.\n<br>In contrast, most construction today is not load-bearing masonry but frame structures of light but strong materials, that support floor slabs and have very thin and light internal and external walls.\n<br>The key idea with this construction is that every wall acts as a load carrying element. In a load bearing structure, you cannot punch holes in a wall to connect two rooms - you would damage the structure if you did so. The immense weight of the walls actually helps to hold the building together and stabilize it against external forces such as wind and earthquake.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>DISADVANTAGES OF LOAD BEARING WALL CONSTRUCTION\n</i></b><br>Load bearing masonry construction is not used today for a number of reasons:\n<br>1. It does not perform very well in earthquakes. Most deaths in earthquakes around the world have occurred in load bearing masonry buildings. Earthquakes love heavy buildings, because that is where they can wreak the greatest havoc.\n<br>2. It is extremely labor-intensive, as it is built mainly of masonry, which is made by hand. Humans have still not developed a machine that produces masonry! This also makes for very slow construction speeds in comparison with modern methods that are far more mechanized.\n<br>3. It is extremely material-intensive. These buildings consume a lot of bricks, and are very heavy. This means that they are not green, as all this material has to be trucked around from where it is produced to the site.\n<br>\n<br><b>Difference between load bearing and framed structure:\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>LOAD BEARING STRUCTURE\n</i></b><br>• Construction cost is less.\n<br>• Suitable up to three stories.\n<br>• Walls are thicker and hence floor area is reduced.\n<br>• Slow construction work.\n<br>• Not possible to alter the position of walls, after the construction.\n<br>• Resistance to earthquake is poor.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>FRAME STRUCTURE\n</i></b><br>• Construction cost is more.\n<br>• Suitable for any number of stories.\n<br>• Walls are thinner and hence more floor area available for use.\n<br>• Construction speed is fast.\n<br>• Position of walls may be changed, whenever necessary.\n<br>• Resistance to earthquake forces is good.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Causes of Damp Wall\n<br>2. Effects of Dampness in Wall\n<br>3. Remedies.\n<br>\n<br><b>Causes of Damp Wall:\n</b><br>There are various causes of ingress of moisture in walls which make them damp:\n<br>i. Defective roof-leakage is a major source of water entering the wall and making it damp.\n<br>ii. Porous bricks used in construction is a permanent source of dampness in walls as they attract  moisture. \n<br>iii. Bad materials used in construction are also a source of damp wall.\n<br>iv. Vegetation – Growth of vegetation in the wall indicates presence of moisture or water without which it could not grow. Vegetation develops further cracks in a wall already having cracks and cause leakage in the wall. \n<br>v. Earth backing against wall – Dumping of earth against wall causes dampness in it.\n<br>vi. Cavities, holes left in the wall due to negligence and dab-holes kept for erection of scaffolding and  later not filled properly with concrete are a prospective source of attracting and storing moisture. \n<br>vii. Mortar joints not laid properly and uniformly are sources of attracting moisture.\n<br>viii. The worst source of moisture ingress in building wall is the defective damp proof course.  Decayed, dilapidated or defectively laid damp proof course, i.e., failure of the damp proof course to arrest rising of moisture from below causes dampness in wall. \n<br>ix. Earth banks – Construction of earthen bank by the side of a building, side slope covering some  height of the wall above damp proof course would cause dampness in wall. \n<br>x. Splashing of rain off the ground on the wall above the damp proof course which happens when the  plinth height is low or there be ground nearby with higher level. \n<br>xi. Defective window sills allowing stagnation of water on it.\n<br>xii. Sloping ground – This generally happens in hill areas, where buildings are constructed on the  slopes of the hills. \n<br>xiii. Dampness in hollow walls is caused due to deposit of mortar droppings during construction and  lack of ventilation. \n<br>xiv. Leaking pipes – Soil, waste water, rain water, or water supply pipes allowing water to enter the  walls. \n<br>xv. Salt in the plaster – Presence of salt in the plaster or precisely in sand used for plaster will render  the wall damp. \n<br>\n<br><b>Effects of Dampness in Wall:\n</b><br>There are many injurious effects which are a direct result of dampness in walls of buildings:\n<br>i. Unhygienic condition inside the building – inviting various diseases to the inmates.\n<br>ii. Decay – The action of moisture on the different portions of the structure induce decay and  disintegration of materials like bricks, stone, steel, timber, etc. as continuous presence of moisture in the portions causes growth of moss, fungus and corrosion. \n<br>iii. Dry rot – The presence of moisture in timber causes the disease in the timber, termed dry rot. Dry rot is effective due to presence of a virulent type of fungus allied to mushroom type. \n<br>iv. Disintegration – Continued presence of moisture in brick may cause mechanical injury to the wall.  If there are cracks in the wall or porosity which may retain water in freezing temperature, the water will freeze, increase in volume and cause severe damage. \n<br>v. Efflorescence – It is produced by the entrance of moisture in the brickwork which usually contains  various soluble salts. These salts are dissolved by the water and issuing from the pores of the bricks, they crystallize and cause disintegration of bricks. \n<br>vi. Furniture – They are damaged due to continuous damp environment.\n<br>vii. Decoration of timber, bamboo, wall papering, etc. get damaged.\n<br>viii. Warping and decay of timber.\n<br>ix. Plaster getting soft and subsequently crumbling.\n<br>x. Corrosion of metal.\n<br>xi. Damage to electrical installations and short circuiting.\n<br>xii. Deterioration of floor covering.\n<br>xiii. Infestation of termite.\n<br>xiv. Blistering, flaking and bleaching of paint.\n<br>\n<br><b>Remedies to Damp Wall:\n</b><br>Remedies to damp wall may be temporary or permanent according to the exigency. Again, treatment  to remove dampness would be different for internal and external walls. \n<br>\n<br><b>Temporary Remedies:\n</b><br>Temporary remedies for internal walls:\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. Application of bituminous painting:\n</i></b><br>The affected wall is to be cleaned, allowed to be dried and then a coat of hot bitumen applied  uniformly. However, if there be difficulty in applying hot bitumen, bituminous compound emulsions are available in the market which may be applied cold with brush. \n<br><b><i>2. Painting with water proofing solution:\n</i></b><br>Either commercially available such solutions or prepared solution as described later may be applied as  prescribed after cleaning the surface. \n<br><b><i>3. Applying cement wash:\n</i></b><br>This is an easy method. Cement and water mixed in thin consistency with admixture of adhesive gum  may be applied one or more coats after cleaning the surface. \n<br>\n<br><b>Temporary Remedies for External Walls:\n</b><br>1. Applying water proofing solutions as mentioned above.\n<br>2. Coating with boiled linseed oil or commercially available linseed oil may be boiled and applied hot  with brush after cleaning the surface. \n<br>3. Applying cement wash as mentioned above.\n<br>4. Sylvester’s Process – Applying alternate coats of soap and alum solutions to the walls where they  will sink into the pores just below the surface. The first coat to be applied after cleaning the surface. Subsequent coats to be applied after the previous coat have dried up. \n<br>5. Painting paraffin – Paraffin oil may be painted over the affected surface after cleaning.\n<br>6. Applying bituminous paint as mentioned above. Application of bitumen or bituminous paint on  walls internal or external though may be effective, will render the wall surface look unpleasant. \n<br>\n<br><b>Permanent Remedies:\n</b><br>Before selecting a method for permanent remedy against dampness in walls, the cause of dampness, shall have to be investigated. Once the cause is established, the action to be taken for remedial measure would not be difficult. The  main object would be to remove the cause. In most of the cases, removal would not be difficult. As for example: \n<br>\n<br>1. Dampness due to leakage from the roof – Stop the roof leakage.\n<br>2. Vegetation – Removal of the vegetation including uprooting and applying chemical solution so that  growth may not recur and sealing if there be any crack. \n<br>3. Earth backing, bank, sloping ground, etc. – The space around the building need be dressed to avoid splashing of water on the wall. \n<br>4. Cavities, holes, etc. – Detect the exact spot, open the space and fill the cavity with concrete.\n<br>5. Defective window sills – These are to be corrected.\n<br>6. Dampness in hollow walls – The main purpose of constructing hollow walls is defeated. Utmost  care must be taken during construction to avoid dropping of mortar. The outer leaf of the wall which is a non-load bearing, may be opened partially for removing the dropped mortar and cleaning. Further, weep holes may be provided below horizontal damp proof course and air bricks may be  provided at suitable places for ventilation. \n<br>7. Salt in plaster – This is due to using bad quality sand during construction. In such case, there is no other alternative than to remove the plaster and apply new rendering with salt free sand. \n<br>8. Leaking pipes – The location need be traced correctly. These mainly happen in cases of soil and waste water pipes, when the pipes from inside the building pass through the wall for coming out. In most cases, there are joints at these locations. These joints need be opened up from outside and the joints or leaks repaired. As the pipe is in horizontal position, the joint must be lead caulked. In cases of rain water pipes, probable location is at the intake mouth at roof level or just below. In such case, the location need be opened carefully and the joint repaired with sand and cement mortar. In cases of water supply pipes, if the pipes laid are exposed, locating the leakage is not difficult.\n<br>In cases of concealed pipes, the identification of the location is not much difficult as the dampness in the wall would indicate the position. The spot need be opened and the leak repaired. \n<br>9. In cases of dampness due to use of porous bricks and bad materials, the solution would be to  demolish the portions and reconstruct those portions with better bricks and materials. If this is not possible due to economic reasons, the remedy would be to remove the plaster from either side and then re-plaster with new mortar of richer proportion with admixture of water-proofing compound. The external plaster should be in two layers, the first layer should be laid over the brick surface after cleaning and raking the joints. 20 mm thick cement sand plaster, 1: 4 over which the second layer of plaster 10 mm thick, 1: 3 to be laid with admixture of water proofing compound. The internal plaster should be single layer 20 mm thick cement and sand 1: 4. \n<br>10. In cases of mortar joints not laid properly – This is a construction defect. The plaster on both the  faces should be removed. The mortar joints should be opened up to 20 mm deep and raked properly and then re-plastered.  \n<br>11. Damp proof course – Damp proofing of a building is achieved by using suitable damp proofing  material which should satisfy the condition to be impervious to the moisture. Now, due to absence of damp proof course or due to bad construction if the damp proof course provided does not satisfy the condition above and moisture rises through the damp proof course and the walls get damp and consequently other ills appear, the commonest method in dealing with the wet rising from the soil by capillary action is insertion of a new damp proof course or replacing the old one. The simple method is to remove two layers of bricks right through the thickness of the wall at the damp proof course level. The bottom course is then replaced, after being reduced in thickness equal to the thickness of the proposed damp proof course to provide room for insertion of the damp proof course. When the lower course has been replaced, it should be covered with a bed of cement mortar 12 mm thick so as to get a uniform bearing all over. Over this, the damp proof course made of cement concrete 1: 1 ½ : 3 with admixture of water proofing compound is to be laid. Then the remaining course of brick is replaced. \n<br>\n<br>They must be well buttered with cement mortar, and after being pushed into the opening, they can  be wedged down into intimate contact with the damp proof course tightly into the top bed joint. The operation should be carried out from the outside and in segments of 1.0 m to 1.2 m in length. Alternate segments are to be taken up. The whole process should be carried out slowly and with precision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
