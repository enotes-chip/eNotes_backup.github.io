This is the area where housekeeping staff report for duty and sign out at the end of the shift. Notice boards, telephones, computers, storage shelves (for registers and files), lost and found cupboard, key racks etc. are present here.\n<br>\n<br>• LAUNDRY: The place in the hotel where washing, pressing, dry cleaning, folding of linen and uniform of the hotel takes place.\n<br>\n<br>• LINEN ROOM: The linen room is the place where the linen of the hotel are stored, collected &amp; circulated throughout the hotel. i.e. of linen- bed sheets, towels, table covers etc.\n<br>\n<br>• UNIFORM ROOM: The place from where uniforms are collected, stored and distributed to the staff of the hotel.\n<br>\n<br>• SEWING ROOM: The place in the department where stitching and repair of linen and uniforms takes place.\n<br>\n<br>• HOUSEKEEPING STORES: This is the storage area in the department where the cleaning agents, cleaning equipment's, guest supplies are stored for the daily housekeeping functions and are securely locked.\n<br>\n<br>• FLOWER ROOM: Ideally should be an air-conditioned room to keep flowers fresh for arrangements in the hotel. It should have work tables, counters, sink, water supply, cupboards to store vases, stones etc.\n<br>\n<br>• LOST AND FOUND: The lost and found section in the department stores all the articles left by the guest and is stored for a specific period.\n<br>\n<br>• FLOOR PANTRY: Located on each guest floor to stock the linen, cleaning supplies and guest supplies required for operations of the floor and should be securely locked.\n<br>\n<br> \n<br>\n<br><b> FLOOR PANTRY/MAID’S SERVICE ROOM\n</b><br>\n<br>Though not attached to the department physically, floor pantries are very much a part of housekeeping department. These are located on each guest floor to keep a stock of linen, guest supplies, and maid’s cart and cleaning supplies for that particular floor. A floor pantry stores a complete set of linen for the whole floor over and above what is already in circulation in the rooms. \n<br>\n<br>The floor pantries are away from guest’s view and should be situated  near the service elevators. It should store all housekeeping items so that the housekeeping staff does not have to keep going back to the housekeeping department or linen room for any item. Since the floor pantry is used to stock expensive items such as linen, it should remain locked at all times when not in use. The key to the floor pantry is kept by the GRA of that floor and a duplicate is kept with the floor supervisor. \n<br>\n<br>The following should be provided in a floor pantry:\n<br>\n<br>• Cupboards to store guest supplies, cleaning agents and equipment.\n<br>\n<br>• Shelves and racks to store fresh room linen.\n<br>\n<br>• Linen trolleys to store fresh and soiled linen and for transporting/dispatching the same to the linen and uniform room.\n<br>\n<br>• A notice board to display information regarding expected arrivals, VIPs in the house, extra bed, and guest loan items given to guests.\n<br>\n<br>• A sink with hot and cold water facilities to wash or disinfect glasses, fill drinking water in flasks, and for flower arrangements.\n<br>\n<br>• Guest loan items such as roll away beds, cribs, and bed boards.\n<br>\n<br>• It should have shelves and cupboards for linen and supplies, and\n<br>\n<br>sufficient area to park a room maid’s cart.\n<br>\n<br>• It should have a sink with water supply.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Housekeeping is also one of the backbone of the hotel industry. The hotel business depends on the guest. A frequent guest knows the difference between a good and mediocre hotel. To him, a hotel is both a home and an office which will be visited many times in a year. In a competitive situation, the guest will choose a hotel in which he feels welcomed. The guests want just more than wine and dine. Housekeeping is the department that is perhaps responsible to bring back the guest to the hotel again and again. This is so because the guest wants personal recognition and the housekeeping department has ample scope to pay attention so to all guests, thus making them feels important.\n<br>\n<br>Moreover, this is the department that is indirectly responsible for earning the maximum revenue for the hotel. The rooms sold by the front office are the rooms made by the housekeeping. We must remember that rooms are the most perishable commodity in a hotel.\n<br>\n<br><b>Importance of Housekeeping\n</b><br>• Hotel’s largest margin of profit comes from the sale of rooms because a room once made can be sold over and over again. Housekeeping helps in the sale of rooms (FO can sell the room only when the HK cleans &amp; makes them ready for sale). A good hotel operation ensures optimal sales to get maximum profit.\n<br>• Room sale is also dependent on the quality of decor, room facilities, cleanliness, and safety of room which is ensured by the housekeeping department.\n<br>• It creates a “home away from home” experience\n<br>• Maintains guest satisfaction by providing a clean, comfortable &amp; safe environment\n<br>• Contributes towards the reputation of the hotel\n<br>• Helps in getting repeat business. Unless the room décor is appropriate, the air odour free plus cleanliness all over, the hotel may lose the guest as a potential repeat customer.\n<br>• Satisfied guests also spread the word of mouth about the property which helps in getting more business.\n<br>• Makes sure that the other departments work also goes on smoothly\n<br>• The tasks performed by a housekeeping department are critical to the smooth operation of any hotel and it is a 24 X 7 X 365 operation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of Housekeeping\n</b><br>1. First Impression: Housekeeping helps us to give a good impression to any customer because when a customer first comes into a hotel, he/she will feel good to see the good system regarding decoration &amp; make his/her visit again and again.\n<br>2. Home Away From Home: Housekeeping provides a home away from home because when any customer takes a room &amp; sees that everything that a room requires is placed on its right place &amp; all the facilities like home are there in the room so he/she will feel that he/she is not away from home.\n<br>3. Repeat Business: When a customer will be satisfied with the services provided by the hotel &amp; also likes the decoration or view of the hotel, he/she will visit the same hotel again&amp; again. Also, he/she will tell others to be the customer of that hotel so we can say that housekeeping plays the role of repeat business.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Housekeeping\n</b><br>The benefits to be given from adopting planned housekeeping and or maintenance subsystem can be considered in financial, aesthetic, and human terms.\n<br><br>• Aesthetic Benefit: Any area looks more attractive if it is maintained clean and if things are placed in the right place and this is achieved by good housekeeping practices. Cleaning is not only essential to retain the appearance of surfaces and total areas, both inside and outside the building but also helps in improving appearance e.g. Floor seals. Appearance and apparent cleanliness do have a psychological effect on the building user – who may value judgment of total experience based on his perception of an initial view of appearance and standards of cleanliness.\n<br>\n<br>• Financial Benefit: Financial benefit refers to good earnings of the hotel when the customer or guests will come again &amp; again so the hotel will get more revenue or earnings that will give financial benefits to the hotel. Over a period of time, it proves more cost-effective to provide cleaning and maintenance services on a regular planned schedule basis. This helps in extending the life span of equipment surfaces, furniture, fittings, and furnishings. Thus deferring the heavy expenditure of frequent replacement or renovation.\n<br>\n<br>• Human Benefit: These benefits are divided into two ways:\n<br><br>1. Guest Benefit: Clean, attractive, well-maintained surroundings are more pleasant, enjoyable, and comfortable for clients to use, increase customer satisfaction, affect repeat business. Housekeeping provides a good facility to the guest so that he feels good &amp; gives them a proper place to stay out of the home without any feeling that we are away from home.\n<br><br>2. Employee Benefit: Employees get a good atmosphere for doing their work or job which is made possible if the hotel has good housekeeping practices. If employees get a good working atmosphere it increases their morale, they work hard &amp; efficient works lead to an increase in the revenue. This in turn not only affects labour turnover and recruitment, but it also contributes to creating hygiene and safety hazards.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Both customers and businesses can benefit from advances in communication, reservations and guest services systems. Technology allows continuous communication and streamlines the guest experience, from reservation to checkout.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a Hotel PMS?\n</b><br>A hotel property management system (PMS) is a set of solutions that hoteliers use to manage their day-to-day hotel operations activities such as reservations, front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, billing and invoicing, analytics and reporting. All of these activities can be labour and time-intensive, so the goal of a modern (Cloud-Based) PMS system is to save hotel managers and their employees time and money.\n<br>In recent years, property management systems have increased their capabilities and moved beyond just completing basic front-office tasks. With a PMS system, you can now offer loyalty programs to guests, gather and analyze data, manage food and beverage services and more. But many hotels still rely on outdated and time-consuming methods to manage their property. Running a hotel is a complex business, and it’s important to stay on top of the latest technology to get ahead in a competitive market. Using a modern PMS can help you stay ahead of your competitors and make sure that your guests have a great experience.\n<br>\n<br><b>IMPORTANCE OF USING COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN FRONT OFFICE\n</b><br>    * Reduces paper work\n<br>    * Environment friendly\n<br>    * Saves time\n<br>    * Increases efficiency\n<br>    * Reduces error\n<br>    * Increases speed and guest satisfaction\n<br>    * Improves co-ordination among different hotel departments\n<br>\n<br><b>PMS APPLICATION IN FRONT OFFICE\n</b><br>The PMS application for the front office has different modules for the efficient functioning of the whole department. Some of the common modules used in front office are: reservations module, front desk module, rooms module, cashier module, night audit module, set up module, report generation module, and back office module.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reservations Module\n</b><br>The reservations module is used to create and manage guest reservations, both for individuals as well as groups.

It simplifies accounting processes such as posting of accounts payable, transfer of accounts receivables, compilation of the payroll, budget preparation, and the production of the hotel's profit-and-loss statement and balance sheet. The financial information entered on a terminal in back office updates all accounting records. The back office module is also linked with the night audit module, which helps in streamlining the accounting process.\n<br>\n<br><b>PMS INTERFACE WITH STAND-ALONE SYSTEMS\n</b><br>When the PMS is integrated with other stand-alone automation systems like points of sale, energy management system, call accounting system, and electronic locking system, it becomes more effective and useful for hotel operations.\n<br>\n<br>1. Point of Sales In a hotel, the points of sale (POS) are the products/services other than accommodation from where the hotel generates revenue. These include restaurants, bars, discotheque, night club, health center, etc. Each point of sale is equipped with a stand-alone automated support for billings. If this is linked with the PMS, the data is immediately transferred to other modules for further processing. For example, a resident guest's credit sale in a restaurant will be immediately transferred to the cashier module, where it will be posted in the respective guest folio.\n<br>2. Call Accounting System Hotels provide telephone facility to their guests. The resident guests can make local as well as long distance calls from the comfort of their rooms. The call accounting system is a stand-alone automated system, which tracks all outgoing and incoming calls. It has the following features: identification of outward dialing, automatic route selection, and call rating programme. When the call accounting system is integrated with the PMS interface, the calls are automatically posted in the respective caller's account.\n<br>3. Energy Management System An energy management system is designed to manage the operations of equipment’s and instruments that consume energy. One typical function would be to shut down the operations of equipment’s that are not is use; for example, when a guest locks his room with the electronic key, the weather control system and lights are automatically turned off.\n<br>4. Electronic Locking System The electronic locking system is used widely nowadays. This system helps the hotels to control access to guest rooms. Only a person with the proper card key coded for the specific room can enter that room. When the electronic locking system is networked with the PMS, the front desk person is able to code the room keys for the guests. The coding is such that the key will become non-functional after the check-out time on the date of departure.\n<br>\n<br><b>DIFFERENT PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n</b><br>There are several companies that provide the PMS software to hotels, with their own unique features to suit the different requirements of various hotels. Some of the companies providing PMS software also provide other tailor-made products to their clients.

Opera\n<br>    2. MARSHA\n<br>    3. Taj Central Reservation System\n<br>    4. Leading Hotels of the World\n<br>    5. Utell\n<br>    6. Best Western Hotels\n<br>    7 . Welcomnet\n<br>    8. Holiday Inn Worldwide\n<br>\n<br><b>Points to consider while selecting a PMS\n</b><br>1. Budget: Budget must be a consideration while selecting a Property Management System for your hotel. A small hotel may want to opt for a local, lesser known brand for the cost constraints while bigger hotels may opt for well known brands as they can afford it.\n<br>2. Brand: Well known PMS brands are considered reliable which may help bigger hotels to decide upon selecting hotel management software based on their brand image.\n<br>3. Cost of Operation: The hardware (computer, printer, back-up discs etc) used by the PMS should be replaceable at a reasonable cost. Costs for operating supplies, such as paper and cartridges should also be reasonable. Systems that require such hardware part which cannot be obtained economically, readily and locally should be avoided.\n<br>4. Ease of Installation: Hotel’s operate 24hrs a day and 7 days a week, so any disruption in the continuous operation of its PMS can affect the hotel and its guests. Before selecting a new PMS, the FOM should thoroughly investigate the amount of time required in the installation of the new system. Installation time and its actual cost must be a common consideration in the selection of a new PMS.\n<br>5. Ease of Use: New Front Office employees must learn how to use the PMS. The ease with which they can learn the system is a factor in reducing training costs and increasing the pace at which new employees become comfortable operating the system.\n<br>6. Ease of Interface Integration: Information needed by FOMs to professionally manage Front Office comes from a variety of sources. Hotels use many automatic systems like card-key machines, telephone systems which must interface with the PMS for operational utility and efficiency.\n<br>7. Maintenance Requirements: Like any other hotel equipment, the PMS must be properly maintained to operate efficiently. The cost of effective preventive maintenance may vary from one PMS to another. The FOM must determine and understand the time and money required to minimize down time and to maximize system efficiency by providing routine, ongoing maintenance.\n<br>8. Ease and Frequency of Upgrading: Technology advances at a fast pace. Hardware and software upgrades are routinely issued by manufacturers, and most of these significantly improve the operational effectiveness of a PMS. FOMs should anticipate significant increases in demand for up gradation, memory, and speed and should provide for the same at the time of procurement.\n<br>9. Quality and Availability of Support Services: A PMS is a computerized system and is vulnerable to hardware malfunctioning, software glitches, and potentially damaging intrusive viruses. Support services personnel, preferably via a toll free telephone number must be accessible on a 24 hrs and 7 days basis.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Using Hotel Management System\n</b><br>Year of 2000, as many as 25% of Indian hotels still reported using pen and paper or Excel spreadsheets to manage all of their front-office tasks like room bookings, billing, and room availability. This can be an inefficient way to do things in the long run. And what would happen if your spreadsheet or paper records got lost or destroyed?\n<br>Using a hotel management system can save you time by automating recurring tasks like updating room rates and availability, sending out reminder emails to guests prior and upon arrival, and invoicing your guests. You can also connect your property management system to a channel manager so that you can take bookings on various channels online, and they will all arrive in your PMS, so you have a way to easily keep track of them all in one place. With a PMS system, your staff spends less time on administrative tasks and more time on satisfying your guests.\n<br>Using a modern hotel management system can increase your revenue by tracking your performance and gathering data about your hotel, analyzing it, and creating reports. From there, you’ll be able to see a clear overview of how your hotel is doing, and you can use this data to make better decisions about how to run the business. For example, you can use your property management system to adopt a dynamic pricing strategy, so you can keep more of your rooms filled at rates that make the customer happy.\n<br><br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Since rooms are the major responsibility of housekeeping, it has a very important role to play. Thus housekeeping works in a very close relationship with the front office, Maintenance &amp; etc.​ \n<br>​The housekeeping department, is just one of the department in a hotel working towards the satisfaction of the guests, and each department is dependent on others for information and services if its work is to be accomplished effectively.​The Housekeeping Department should co-ordinate and ensure maximum co-operation with other departments to provide high quality service. A well planned work schedule should be prepared so as to ensure minimum disruption to the guests and work flow of other departments. The executive housekeeper is responsible for ensuring this by supervising a group of staff or working closely with staff from other departments.\n<br>The housekeeping departments cooperated with the following department in the industry. Receptions, restaurant, security, kitchen and account etc.\n<br>Hospitality is the provision of basic needs of food, shelter and recreational facilities to clients in order to make them story pleasant and comfortable.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A front office accounting system monitors and charts the transactions of guest and businesses, agencies, and other non-guests using the hotels services and facilities. The front offices ability to perform accounting tasks in a perfect and complete manner will directly affect the hotels ability to collect the hotels outstanding balances.\n<br>The resident or in-house guests of a hotel are those who are staying in the hotel. They seldom pay on the spot for the use of hotel services and facilities like restaurants, laundry, fitness centre, spa, salon, and so on. They sign the bills to verify their use of the services and the amount incurred. The bills are posted in their folio, and a final consolidated bill is made at the time of their departure. In other words, the hotel provides credit facility at the time of the utilization of the hotel services to the resident guests. An accurate posting of the guest accounts is very essential to ensure the guest's goodwill and the recovery of all the charges incurred by the guest.\n<br>In order to maximize revenue, hotels offer some services and facilities to non-resident guests as well. These may include the use of the fitness and health centre, swimming pool, club facilities, food and beverage outlets, and so on. When these services and facilities are offered to non- resident guest on credit, the account of the same is maintained by the front office cashier. As the number of financial transactions that take place between a hotel and its guests (resident and non-resident) is very high, the front desk cashier should maintain the guest accounts accurately and properly.\n<br>However, the collection of a non-resident account is not the responsibility of the front desk; it is collected by the accounts department. Also, when a resident guest, whose account is to be settled by his company, checks out from the hotel after signing the bills, his account turns into a non-guest account, and the collection responsibility shifts from the front desk to the accounts section.\n<br>\n<br><b>The major functions of front office accounting system are as under:\n</b><br>• Creation and maintenance of guest and non-guest accounts accurately.\n<br>• Tracking financial transactions of guests throughout the guest cycle.\n<br>• Monitoring the credit limit of guests, and asking for a deposit from guests in case of high outstanding balance.\n<br>• Preparing a high balance report for collection and informing the management about the same.\n<br>• Providing an efficient management information system (MIS) to the management for departmental revenue generation.\n<br>• Maintaining effective control over cash and credit transactions.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Accounts</b>\n<br>The front desk maintains two types of accounts:\n<br>\n<br>• Guest accounts\n<br>• Non-guest accounts\n<br>\n<br><b>Guest Account</b> A guest account is the record of financial transactions between and a resident guest and the hotel. This account is created either during the registration of the guest at the time of check-in) or during reservation, if the guest makes an advance The front office creates an individual folio for each guest—for maintaining a record of all the financial transactions that take place during the stay of the guest. On the basis of a guest's folio, the final bill is prepared and presented to the guest for collection.\n<br>Hotels generally extend credit facility to guests for the use of the services and products provided by them. They fix an upper limit to the credit facility, which is known as the house limit. When the credit balance of the guest exceeds the house limit, the front desk cashier may ask the guest to make a part or full payment of the outstanding balance.\n<br>\n<br><b>Non-guest Account</b> A non-guest account is the record of the financial transactions that take place between a non-resident guest and the hotel. This is also known as a city account. The front desk cashier maintains records of financial transactions between the hotel and a local resident to whom the hotel has extended the credit facility for the use of hotel facilities and services. Besides local guests, the front desk cashier also maintains other types of non-guest accounts, which include:\n<br>\n<br>• Guests who leave the hotel without the settlement of their accounts are known as skippers; their accounts are also treated as non-resident guest accounts. The account is transferred to the city ledger awaiting eventual payment, and after a stipulated wait time, the same is written off as a bad debt.\n<br>• The status of guests, whose accounts are not settled by them (in case of bills to company), changes from resident to non-resident guests when they leave the hotel. The front office cashier transfers the balance to the city ledger and the payment is collected by the accounts department.\n<br>• When advance payment has been received for a guaranteed reservation and it’s subsequently a no-show, the account is normally recorded in the sales ledger.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

This document lists detailed transaction information gathered at the source of the transaction. For example, hotel revenue outlets use vouchers to notify the front office of guest charge purchases, which require posting. Types of Vouchers :\n<br>\n<br>1. Visitors Paid-out\n<br>\n<br>2. Miscellaneous Charge Voucher\n<br>\n<br>3. Cash Receipt Voucher\n<br>\n<br>4. Telephone Call Voucher\n<br>\n<br>5. Travel Agent Voucher\n<br>\n<br>6. Commission Voucher\n<br>\n<br>7. Guest Allowances\n<br>\n<br>8. Restaurant/Bar Check\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Visitors Paid-out </b>The money paid by the hotel on behalf of guests is known as visitors paid-out (VPO). A VPO is generally made for the following charges:\n<br>\n<br>• Payment for taxi, travel agency services\n<br>\n<br>• Porter charges\n<br>\n<br>• Florist charges\n<br>\n<br>• Postage and courier charges\n<br>\n<br>• Emergency medical expenses\n<br>\n<br>The paid-outs are made from the cash bank that is maintained by the front office cashier. A proper authorization should be taken from the lobby manager before making the VPO. To make a paid-out, one should:\n<br>\n<br>• Confirm the name, room number, and identity of the guest.\n<br>\n<br>• Fill the paid-out voucher properly, mentioning the details of services paid for it.\n<br>\n<br>• Get the VPO authorized by the lobby manager.\n<br>\n<br>• Make the payment.\n<br>\n<br>• Post the entry in the guest folio and place the voucher in the folio docket.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Miscellaneous Charge Voucher</b> A miscellaneous charge voucher is prepared for the payment of miscellaneous services and facilities, like laundry, health club, fitness centre, beauty salon, etc. The guest verifies and signs the miscellaneous charge voucher, which is sent to the front desk cashier for posting the charges into the guest folio.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Cash Receipt Voucher</b> A receipt is an acknowledgment that a payment has been made. A cash receipt voucher is prepared and issued to the person depositing cash as a proof of remittance of the deposited cash.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Telephone Call Voucher</b> Nowadays a lot of hotels use computerized systems, where, whenever a guest makes a call, the call accounting module automatically transfers the call charges to the guest folio. In small hotels, where outgoing calls are routed through the operator, the responsibility of billing the call charges lies with the telephone operator, who puts down the call details on a telephone charge voucher and sends it to the front desk cashier for posting into the guest account.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Travel Agent Voucher</b> Most tour operators and travel agencies receive advance payment from their clients for making travel arrangements like accommodation, food and beverage, and other services. The travel agency then makes the reservation in a hotel on behalf of the guest. It sends a voucher, known as a travel agent voucher, containing the details of the billing procedure and services to be provided to the guest. Airlines that have contracts with hotels also send meals and accommodation order (MAO) or passenger service order (PSO) for layover passengers due to delay or cancellation of flights. In these cases, the hotel obtains payments from the travel agency or airline.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Commission Voucher</b> Hotels offer commission to persons who provide regular business to them. Whenever a commission is paid by the cashier, a commission voucher is made. The commission voucher should be authorized by a competent authority of the hotel. Generally, it is authorized by the lobby manager. More commonly, commission vouchers are made for the following:\n<br>\n<br>• A taxi driver who brings a walk-in guest to the hotel. In case the guest stays at the hotel, the hotel pays a commission to the taxi driver.\n<br>\n<br>• A travel agent/tour operator working on commission basis (generally, the commission is 10 per cent on the room rates, excluding taxes).\n<br>\n<br>• Any agency working on a commission basis.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Guest Allowances</b> An allowance is an amount deducted from an invoice to compensate the buyer for an expense or mistake. The guest allowance is the cash paid to the guest by the hotel, especially in the following circumstances:\n<br>\n<br>• If there is a wrong posting of a charge in the guest folio, an allowance is given and the voucher is made to nullify the guest folio balance due to the wrong posting.\n<br>\n<br>• If a guest has deposited a large sum as advance and that amount exceeds the hotel bill.\n<br>\n<br>• If an airline or a tour operator sends a crew or a group and guarantees the reimbursement of their bills.\n<br>\n<br>Guest allowances are strictly controlled. The front desk cashier requires an authorization from a competent authority before making such a payment.\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Restaurant/Bar Check</b> Resident guests may enjoy their meals in any of the food and beverage outlets in a hotel. Whenever a guest consumes food or beverage in a restaurant, a bill is raised; in case a resident guest wishes to utilize the credit facility offered by the hotel, he should sign the bill. The signed bills serve as the proof of financial transactions at the food and beverage outlets and are treated as vouchers for posting the charges to the guest folio\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Folios\n</b><br>\n<br>Front office transactions are typically charted on account statement called folios. A folio is a statement of all transactions (debits &amp; credits) affecting the balance of a single account. When an account is created, it is assigned a folio with a starting balance of zero. All transactions which increase (debits) or decrease (credits) the balances of the account are recorded on the folio. At settlement, a guest folio should be returned to a zero balance by cash payment or by transfer to an approved credit card or direct billing account.\n<br>\n<br>The process of recording transactions on a folio is called posting. A transaction is posted when it has been recorded on the proper folio in the proper location and a new balance has been determined. When posting transactions, the front office may rely on hand written folios (if it is using a non-automated system), a machine-posted folios (with a semi-automated system), or computer-based electronic folios (with a fully automated system)\n<br>\n<br>Regardless of the posting technique used, the basic accounting information recorded on a folio remains the same. In a non-automated or semi-automated record keeping system, guest folios are maintained at the front desk. In a fully automated record keeping system, electronic folios are stored in a computer and can be retrieved, displayed, or printed on request.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>There are basically four types of folios used in front office accounting. They are:\n<br>\n<br><b>• Guest folios:-</b> accounts assigned to individual persons or guest rooms\n<br>\n<br><b>• Master folios:-</b> accounts assigned to more than one person or guest room; usually reserved for group accounts.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Non-guest or semi-permanent folios:-</b> accounts assigned to non-guest businesses or agencies with hotel charge purchase privileges.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Employee folios:- </b>accounts assigned to employees with charge purchase privileges. Executives like Sales and Marketing Director, Front Office Manager may charge the hotel for travel and entertainment to promote the business\n<br>\n<br>Additional types of folios are frequently created by front office management to accommodate special circumstances or requests. For e.g... A business guest may request that his or her charges and payments be split between two personal folios: one to record expenses to be paid by the sponsoring business, &amp; one to record personal expenses to be paid by the guest. This is referred to as a split folio. In this situation, two folios are created for one guest. If the room and tax portion are to be separated from other charges, the room and tax is posted to the room folio. This is sometimes called the A folio. Food, beverage, telephone, &amp; other charges are posted to the incidental folio or B folio.\n<br>\n<br>Every folio should have a unique serial number. Folio serial numbers are needed for many reasons. First, they serve as identification numbers that help ensure that all folios are accounted for during an audit of front office transactions. Second, folio numbers may be used to index information in automated system. Automated systems frequently create folio numbers when reservations are made. Folio numbers are then transferred to the front desk for use during registration. Finally, folio numbers can provide a chain of documentation. In non-automated &amp; semi-automated systems, folios have specific length &amp; can hold only a limited number of postings. When a balance must be carried forward to a new folio, the old folio numbers should be shown as a reference of where the balance originated.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Ledger\n</b><br>\n<br>A ledger is a collection of the same type of accounts. The front office ledger has a collection of folios. There are normally two ledgers maintained by the front office. One of them, as guest ledger, contains all the folio entries of resident guests; the other contains the folio entries of non-resident guest accounts and is known as city ledger.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Guest Ledger</b> A guest ledger contains the details of all the financial transactions between a resident guest and the hotel, including charge purchases and the payments received from the guest. It has two parts—debit and credit. By taking a  look at the guest ledger, one can find the credit or debit balance of an individual guest as well as the total credit or debit balance on date. In a manual system, the financial transactions are recorded in a tabular ledger, or tab ledger, which is of two types: \n<br>\n<br><br>• Horizontal tabular ledger\n<br>\n<br>• Vertical tabular ledger\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>* Horizontal tabular ledger In a horizontal tabular ledger, all the credit expenses of the guest are recorded in one horizontal row, and at the end of the row, the guests' credit or debit balance is shown. The vertical row of the table contains the room numbers. At the end of vertical column, the daily sales balance can be seen.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>* Visitors/Vertical tabular ledger A vertical tabular ledger is a variation of the horizontal tabular ledger. It is also called visitors tabular ledger. The rows depict the room numbers, and in the columns, the details of the guests and their credit expenses as well as payments are recorded. At the end of every column, one can find the account balance of individual guests staying in a particular room. It is a loose sheet and is prepared on a daily basis by the front desk cashier.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. City Ledger</b> A city ledger contains the collective accounts of all the non-resident individuals/agencies to whom the hotel extends credit facility. It is also called non guest account. City ledgers also contain the accounts of resident guests who have left the hotel without settling their accounts, which would be settled at a later date by a third party (may be a credit card company, an airline, a travel agency, or a corporate house). This account would be closed at the time of receiving the complete payment. The account of skippers is also maintained in the city ledger for a specific period (as per the hotel policy); at the expiry of this period the same is written off as bad debt and the account is closed. This ledger also includes bad cheque accounts (cheque's that have bounced), disputed bills account (bills that are in dispute), late charges accounts (bills that could not be posted in the guest bill at the time of check-out), and retention charges accounts (reservation was guaranteed but the same was cancelled or guest did not show up\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The front office accounting cycle has three distinct phases:\n<br>\n<br>1. Creation of accounts\n<br>2. Maintenance of accounts\n<br>3. Settlement of accounts\n<br>\n<br><b>Creation of Accounts\n</b><br>A guest account is created when the first financial transaction between the hotel and a guest takes place. It may happen at one of the following stages:\n<br>\n<br>• At the time of reservation, if the guest pays an advance amount (may be part or full). For example, Shreya is reserving a room for 25 to 28 December on 25 October. The dates fall under the black-out period, and hence, all reservations have to be guaranteed by full advance payment. She deposits Rs 18,000 towards the room rent for three nights, which is entered as the first transaction in her account.\n<br>• At the time the hotel receives the advance payment for a booking—after the reservation has been made and before the arrival of the guest. For example, Kiran has made a reservation for a room from 14 to 17 September on I July. She makes an advance payment of Rs 10,000 on 14 August; her guest account is created immediately and the transaction is entered in the same.\n<br>• At the time of guest registration, when a room is allotted to the guest. For example, Vijay from Microsoft India has made a reservation from I to 3 August. He submits the bill to company letter for the room rent at the time of registration on I August. His guest account is created and the day's room rent is posted in that. His sister, Anuja, also has a reservation for the same nights and she deposits a payment of Rs 5,000 for the same. Her account is also created on the same day with debit and credit information.\n<br>\n<br>A guest folio is created on the day the hotel receives a payment from the guest and the transactions are recorded in the order of their occurrence. The hotel sets a credit limit, known as floor limit, for each guest, which is the maximum amount of credit that the hotel will extend to the guest.\n<br>\n<br><b>Maintenance of Accounts\n</b><br>All the monetary transactions that take place between the hotel and a guest are recorded in the guest folio in the order of their occurrence. An entry in the guest folio may be either debit or credit.\n<br>\n<br>The most common debit entries in a guest account include the following:\n<br>• Room charges\n<br>• Food and beverage charges (restaurant, bar, coffee shop, room service, etc.) Telephone and fax charges\n<br>• Health centre, business centre, fitness centre charges\n<br>• Laundry charges\n<br>• Postage charges\n<br>• Transportation charges\n<br>• Visitors paid-out\n<br>Credit entries in a guest account may include the following:\n<br>• Pre-payment, in part or in full (at the time of reservation or between reservation and arrival).\n<br>• Part payment during the stay.\n<br>• Allowances given to the guest.\n<br>• Adjustments made in case of any error in posting in the guest folio. • Final payment for the settlement of accounts at the time of check-out.\n<br>\n<br><b>Settlement of Accounts\n</b><br>This is the final and concluding phase of the front office accounting cycle. The settlement of account means zeroing the balance in a guest folio. The formula for calculating the outstanding balance is:\n<br>\n<br>Opening balance + Debit entries — Credit entries = Outstanding amount\n<br>\n<br>The guest account may have a credit or debit balance during the stay of the guest. At the time of departure, the final bill of the guest is prepared and settled in such a way that the outstanding balance is brought to zero. If the advance paid by the guest is less than the total billing amount, the guest should pay the balance amount. For example, Shreya had made an advance payment of Rs 18,000 at the time of reservation. Her total bill at the time of check-out is 21,000, so she pays the balance of Rs 3,000 to the cashier. In case the amount paid in advance exceeds the billing amount, the balance is refunded to the guest to settle the guest account. For example, Kiran paid Rs 10,000 for her stay, but due to an emergency, she had to leave in a day and her bill came to Rs 4,500. The balance amount of Rs 5,500 is refunded to Kiran.\n<br>The settlement of the guest account may be by cash or credit. In case of credit settlement, the account balance is transferred to the city ledger and the responsibility of collecting the balance is transferred to the accounts department. For example, Vijay's room bill is sent to Microsoft India for settlement as per the billing instructions while the other bills are settled directly by him at the hotel as per actuals. Anuja's bills came to a total of Rs 5,000. As she had deposited the same amount as advance, she does not need to make any additional payment nor does the hotel need to give a refund. <br><br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The security department of the hotel is responsible for the overall security of the building, in-house guests, visitors, day users, and employees of the hotel. Guests hold the hotel responsible for their safety and can file for compensation in case of a security lapse in the hotel's security measures.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Security Staff and System\n</b><br>A hotel's security staff may include in-house security personnel and contracted security officer’s. Hotels generally prefer ex-army or ex-police officials as their officer’s because they are already well versed with various security aspects and have a lot of experience in the field. Security responsibilities may include patrolling the property, monitoring surveillance equipment and, in general ensuring that the guests, visitors and employees are safe and secure. The security department is responsible for establishing the details of room keys security, fire safety systems, emergency evacuation plans, and emergency communication plans. The effectiveness of the security department depends upon the cooperation and assistance of the local law enforcement officials. The security personnel should be trained to handle situations like vandalism, terrorist attacks, and bomb threats and also be trained to prevent and fight fire.\n<br>Every hotel should have a proper security system to protect its guests, employees, and their properties. Hotels take measures like installing closed circuit televisions in public areas for proper surveillance, ensuring proper lighting of public areas, and fencing of the hotel property. and positioning security guards at entry gates for the safety and security of their guests and their belongings. Hiring an independent security agency to routinely check the security systems also helps in ensuring the safety and security of guests.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of Front Office\n</b><br> A Front desk professional is required to assume a variety of roles during a variety of hours during a workday —chief among being a gatekeeper, communications expert, phone wiz trouble shooter and receptionist. As a hotel's first contact with guests, vendors, visitors, and delivery people, the front office staff is the eyes and ears of the organization. It is up to them to spot potential troublemakers, identify red-flag behaviors, prevent breaches of security, and act with confidence and authority when situations threaten to get out of hand.\n<br>A security programme would be effective if all the hotel employees participate in the hotel's security efforts .The front office personnel play a vital role in assisting the hotel's security personnel to carry out their tasks efficiently. The front office employees like door attendants, parking attendants, bell boys, and receptionists should observe all the people who are entering or leaving the hotel premises and if they notice any suspicious activity or circumstances, they should immediately report the same to the security personnel.\n<br>\n<br><b>SAFE DEPOSIT\n</b><br>Though the hotel is not responsible for the guest valuables, the rule to this effect is written in the guest registration card and also notified in the guest room. But a hotel offers a free safe deposit facility for his valuables.\n<br>Hotels have bank type of lockers installed at the front office cashier. A locker is allotted to guests that can be opened by using two keys. The master key is with the front office cashier and another key is issued to the guest. A contract is also signed in between the guest and the hotel. Whenever a guest wants to open that locker it has to be entered into the locker operating register. Signatures are always verified with the specimen. Head cashier inserts his key then a guest inserts his own key, and then only a lock can be opened. Guest is left alone to operate his locker. Guests can lock the locker with their own key. At the time of departure the guest is asked to vacate the locker.\n<br>If the key is lost by the guest, then the locker will be drilled open in presence of the guest and can be charged for the replacement of the locker.\n<br>If the forgets to vacate the locker, he or she has to be informed by the hotel to come and vacate it either personally or by sending an authorized person with an authority letter.\n<br>These days some hotels have installed an electronic safe deposit box in each guest room. This safety box can be operated by using an electronic number. Guests can use any number to open the lock. The number selected by the guest becomes the locker’s code number and the guests are advised to keep their valuables in the electronic safety box. Though the hotel is not responsible for any lost items. But hotels take this issue as a prestige issue So an inquiry is done on the hotel security level.\n<br>\n<br><b>Key Control\n</b><br>It is the duty and responsibility of the front desk staff to ensure the right guest is given the key to his room and his safety and security pertaining to issuance of key is not compromised or violated during his stay in the hotel.\n<br>A Front Desk Agent should never give keys, room numbers, messages, parcels or mails to any person without first requiring appropriate identification.\n<br>For Security reasons hotels use at least three types of keys, Emergency Key, Master key and guest room keys. Types of keys used may vary hotel by hotel but the process of handling them remains pretty much the same.\n<br>\n<br><b>When Guest Request for room key:\n</b><br>• Request for Guest’s last name and room number.\n<br>• Cross check the information given by guests against the reservation details on the hotel software (PMS).\n<br>• If there any mismatch is the details provided then request for any valid photo identification like passport, Driving license, government ID cards etc.\n<br>• Do not handover the room keys without proper authentication of the guest identity.\n<br>• If no picture identification is available by the guests, the Front office assistant must accompany the guests to the room to confirm the identity. When being challenged by our actions, we are to inform the guest:\n<br><b><i>“We are doing this for your security and safety. We appreciate your understanding.”\n</i></b><br>• Only in an emergency situation can we use the information on the guest passport number, date of birth, address given to the hotel on arrival etc. to ascertain the computer’s record.\n<br>• When in doubt with the identity and the guest refused to be escorted to the room, inform the Front office manager immediately. If the Team Leader or Assistant Manager – Front Office could recognize the guest, give the duplicate key to the guest while reinforcing politely why we need to perform the identity check.\n<br>• Check if the guest requires an additional key or if he has lost his previous key.\n<br>• If a guest requests an additional key, program a new key with duplicate code.\n<br>• If a guest has lost his previous key, program a key with new code.\n<br>• Present the new key to the guest\n<br>Keys must never be issued to persons claiming to have the guest’s permission to enter the room unless the guest has personally given his /her verbal or written authorization to the Front Office team.\n<br>Room numbers should not be written on the keys in case keys are misplaced. A set of codes are encoded to differentiate keys being held by guests.\n<br>\n<br><b>On Staff’s request entry into occupied room:\n</b><br>Only designated operational staff is allowed access to occupied guest rooms. They are: Bellboys, Concierge, Front Desk agents, Housekeeping Manager, Assistant Manager– Housekeeping / Team Leader / Designated Room Attendant and Laundry Attendant, Mini Bar, F&amp;B – Room Service Fruits Deliverer.\n<br>Key machines should constantly be in ‘log off” mode. Access code should be known only to those designated personnel and not shared among other staff.\n<br>Cashier may hand over the checked out room key to the bellman to collect luggage and check mini-bar and safe boxes. The bellman must return the used key to the same cashier after removing the luggage from the room.\n<br>\n<br><b>“Showroom” / Sales mock up rooms Keys\n</b><br>On a daily basis, a set of rooms will be blocked off for viewing purposes by the Duty Manager – Front Office.\n<br>Two sets of keys to these rooms will be programmed and placed at the Front Office Reception for site visit purposes.\n<br>Staff releasing the site visit keys must inform the receiver to return the keys back to the Reception upon completion.\n<br>\n<br><b>FIRE SAFETY\n</b><br>Fire is among the major potential hazards associated with hotels. It could take place due to cigarette smoking in rooms, faulty electrical wiring, or faulty equipment. Hotels must be equipped to safeguard guests and their property from fire by installing smoke detectors and by conducting routine checks to see that the wiring and equipment are not defective. All the employees must be aware of specific procedures laid down by the establishment and must be ready to comply with them at any time. There should be fire drills during low occupancy periods to check how the employees put their knowledge of laid down procedures into practice. Generally, fire extinguishers are installed in hotels at strategic locations and fire exits are earmarked for use in the event of fire. Guests should be made aware of the same.\n<br>The presence of three basic components—fuel (a combustible substance), oxygen (necessary as fire is an oxidation reaction), and heat (ignition temperature)—results in the outbreak of fire. If any one of them is absent, fire cannot break out. Fire can be extinguished by starving, smothering, and cooling\n<br>• Starving Starving is the removal of fuel from the vicinity of fire so that it doesn't spread. In case fire breaks out in an area where wood is stored, it can be extinguished by removing all the wood (fuel) from that area. This way one of the major components of fire will be eliminated.\n<br>• Smothering Smothering is the removal of air. Fire can be extinguished by cutting off the supply of air (oxygen), which is necessary for the existence of fire. Throwing a blanket over fire smothers the air and extinguishes the fire.\n<br>• Cooling Heat (ignition temperature) is also essential for the existence of fire. Cooling by adding water—brings down the temperature and puts out fire.\n<br>\n<br><b>Classification of Fire\n</b><br>Depending upon the combustible material that has caught fire, fire is classified in the following five groups:\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Fires\n</b><br>Not all fires are the same. Per NFPA 10, burning may be classified into one or more of the following fire classes and your fire protection specialist will select the right fire extinguisher size and agent for the hazard.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class A\n</b><br>Class A fires are fires in ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber, and many plastics.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class B\n</b><br>Class B fires are fires in flammable liquids such as gasoline, petroleum greases, tars, oils, oil-based paints, solvents, alcohols. Class B fires also include flammable gases such as propane and butane. Class B fires do not include fires involving cooking oils and grease.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class C\n</b><br>Class C fires are fires involving energized electrical equipment such as computers, servers, motors, transformers, and appliances. Remove the power and the Class C fire becomes one of the other classes of fire.\n<br>\n<b><br>• Class D\n</b><br>Class D fires are fires in combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, sodium, lithium, and potassium.\n<br>\n<br><b>• Class K\n</b><br>Class K fires are fires in cooking oils and greases such as animal and vegetable fats.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedure in the Event of Fire\n</b><br>• The guidelines for the front office staff in the event of fire are as follows:\n<br>• When fire is detected, inform the concerned people immediately.\n<br>• Do not panic.\n<br>• Warn other people in the vicinity and sound the fire alarm\n<br>• Do not jeopardize your own safety or that of others.\n<br>• Follow the procedure laid down by your establishment\n<br>• Call the fire brigade immediately\n<br>• Dot not try to extinguish fire if you are not trained for the same; fire may spread if not handled properly\n<br>• If you are trained for firefighting, use the appropriate fire extinguisher to put out the fire.\n<br>• Close the doors and windows; turn off the supply of electricity and gas\n<br>\n<br>It is important that all the passageways are kept clear and the doors and windows are opened. Fire exits should be marked properly and should be visible in dark too. The fire extinguishers should be placed at proper places and should be in working condition. Fire drills should be carried out periodically. Fire detection systems, sprinkling systems, smoke detecting systems, fire fighting equipment, like fire hoses, etc. should be inspected and tested at regular intervals to ensure that they remain functional in the event of fire.\n<br>\n<br><b>ACCIDENTS</b>\n<br>According to Advanced Learner's dictionary, an accident is 'an unpleasant event that happens unexpectedly and causes injury or damage'. Accidents may occur due to any one of the following reasons:\n<br>\n<br>Excessive Haste Excessive haste is among the prime causes of accidents because a person in haste may overlook the safety rules or obstacles in the way. Therefore, to avoid accidents, one must not be in a hurry or run while on the job. For example, bell boys, when in a hurry to carry the luggage of a group, may overlook objects in blind corners and may meet with an accident.\n<br>\n<br>Carelessness Carelessness is also a common cause of accidents. The careless handling of goods and equipment may lead to accidents. For example, if a bell boy is careless with the luggage, he may trip and fall.\n<br>\n<br>Anxiety Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear about something. An anxious person will not be able to concentrate on the task at hand and this might lead to accidents.\n<br>\n<br>Lack of Interest If a person lacks interest in what she is doing, she becomes careless and doesn't follow the correct procedure for carrying out a task, leading to accidents.\n<br>\n<br>Lack of Concentration A person may not be able to concentrate on work due to personal problems, lack of interest, distractions, etc. The lack of concentration may lead to problems and accidents.\n<br>Failure to Apply Safety Rules Safety rules, if followed, prevent accidents. Before operating any equipment, one should read and follow the operating instructions given in the product manual in order to eliminate the chances of accidents. The failure to apply safety rules may cause accidents.\n<br>\n<br><b>Accidents in Hotels\n</b><br>In hotels, accidents usually happen in one of the following areas:\n<br>• Stairways\n<br>• Balconies or landings\n<br>• Ramps\n<br>• Parking lots\n<br>• Bathtubs or showers\n<br>To minimize the number of accidents and to avoid workplace injuries, the hotels should take care of the common problems, some of which are as follows:\n<br>• Presence of handrails/guardrails\n<br>• Presence of a non-slip surface\n<br>• Adequacy of landing areas\n<br>• The accident victim's field of vision\n<br>• The accident victim's health and behavior\n<br>• Adequacy of lighting\n<br>• Weather conditions (wet, snowy) and maintenance (cleaned, recently polished)\n<br>\n<br><b>Accident Report\n</b><br>In spite of all the precautions taken by hotels to prevent accidents, mishaps may still occur. If a staff member meets with an accident within the hotel premises, it must be reported to the management and a record of the accident must be entered in the accident book.\n<br>A proper reporting of accidents is important for the following reasons:\n<br>• The accident-prone areas may be identified so that appropriate signs may be placed there to avoid any future accidents.\n<br>• First aid may be given to the injured person.\n<br>• If the injury is serious, an ambulance may be summoned.\n<br>• The damage/loss due to the accident can be assessed.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It is mandatory for an establishment to have adequate first aid equipment, facilities, and trained personnel to provide first aid in the work area. If the injury is serious, the injured person should be treated by a doctor or a qualified nurse as soon as possible.\n<br>First Aid Box\n<br>There should be a first aid box in the work area and it should be easily identifiable and accessible. It should be in the charge of a responsible person, who should ensure that the consumed medicines are replenished and the expired medicines are replaced regularly. A first aid box must contain the following things:\n<br>• A card giving general first-aid guidance.\n<br>• Twenty individually wrapped, sterile, adhesive, waterproof dressings of various sizes.\n<br>• An antiseptic lotion and an antiseptic cream.\n<br>• Cotton wool packets (4 x 25 g).\n<br>• One dozen safety pins.\n<br>• Two triangular bandages.\n<br>• Two sterile eye pads, with attachment.\n<br>• Four medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Two large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Two extra large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.\n<br>• Scissors\n<br>• A report book to record all injuries.\n<br>First Aid for Some Common Problems\n<br>• Shock The signs of shock are faintness, sickness, clammy skin, and pale face. A person who has suffered a shock should be made to lie down. To make him comfortable and warm, he should be covered with a blanket or additional clothes.\n<br>• Cuts All cuts should be washed with an antiseptic lotion and covered with a waterproof dressing. In case of considerable bleeding, it should be stopped as soon as possible by bandaging firmly or by pressing the artery with thumb. If bleeding doesn't stop, immediate medical assistance should be sought.\n<br>• Nose Bleeding Tn case of nose bleeding, the person should be asked to sit down with the head bent forward- His clothing should be loosened round the neck, chest, and waist. To stop the bleeding, apply pressure and pinch the nostrils closed for about five minutes. Nose bleeding occurs due to the rupture of the fine capillary of artery; applying pressure and keeping the nostril closed provides sufficient time for blood coagulation. If bleeding persists, seek medical assistance.\n<br>• Fainting A person may faint after standing for a long period in a hot, badly ventilated area. The symptoms include whiteness, giddiness, and sweating. The perv;n should be made to lie down and his legs should be raised slightly above the level of his head. when he regains consciousness, he should be kept in fresh air for a while and it should be ensured that he did not injure himself when he fainted.\n<br>• Fractures In case of a suspected fracture, the first step should be to remove any pressure from the affected part and to make it immobile. One should not try to realign the bone and seek immediate medical assistance. If there is bleeding, apply pressure to the wound with a sterile bandage or a clean cloth. To prevent swelling and to relieve pain till the medical assistance arrives, apply ice packs wrapped in a towel or a piece of cloth. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, he should be made to lie down,with the head slightly lower than the trunk, and, if possible, his legs should be elevated.\n<br>• Burns and Scalds Burn is caused by a dry heat source like flame or hot articles, whereas scalds are caused bv a wet heat source like steam or boiling liquids. The burnt part should be placed under running cold water or immersed in cold water till the pain ceases. If it's a major burn, seek the assistance of a doctor.\n<br>• Muscle Strain In case of a sprain, stop the activity that caused the injury and appJy ice to the injured area to reduce swelling. Use a bandage to restrict the movement of the injured area, and, if possible, elevate the injured part to make the fluids drain away.\n<br><br><b>HANDLING UNUSUAL EVENTS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS\n</b><br><b><br></b><br>Besides accidents and injuries, the hotel staff should be equipped to handle unusual events and emergency situations like:\n<br><br>• Terrorist activities and bomb threat\n<br>• Robbery and theft\n<br>• Drunken guests\n<br>\n<br>Terrorist Activities and Bomb Threat\n<br>In view of recent terrorist attacks in the top hotels of Mumbai, hotels have heightened their security levels for the safety of their guests and staff. It is a challenge for the hotel security staff to strike the right balance between being hospitable and being alert to the activities of the resident and non-resident guests. They also have to go in for extra security measures.\n<br>Hotels that cater to VIPs like cinestars, politicians, CEOs of key companies, etc. are potential targets of terrorist attacks and should be well equipped to handle terrorist threats. In case of a bomb threat, the hotel should liaise with the local police authorities and follow their instructions. If the bomb threat comes over the telephone, the person receiving such a call should follow the given procedure:\n<br><br>• Do not interrupt the caller.\n<br>• write down the exact words of the caller.\n<br>• If possible find out:\n<br>    1. The time by which the bomb is due to explode.\n<br>    2. The place where the device is placed.\n<br>    3. The description of the device.\n<br>    4. The motive of the attackers.\n<br>    5. The identity of the attackers.\n<br>• Write everything as soon as the call is disconnected. If available, a bomb threat form may be used. Try to note down the following:\n<br>    1. Caller's voice\n<br>    2. Mannerism\n<br>    3. Age and sex \n<br>    4. Accent\n<br>• Any background noise, etc.\n<br>• Do not alter the exact conversation between you and the caller while narrating the incident to the authorities.\n<br>• Inform the competent authority immediately.\n<br>• Do not spread any rumour.\n<br>• Do not attempt to defuse the bomb if you are able to locate the same. Contact the local police authority or bomb disposal squad for defusing the device.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Also, the valuables in the possession of guests may invite burglars. To discourage robbers, the guests should be asked to leave their valuables in the front office safety deposit locker or in the in-room locker. In the event of an armed robbery, the hotel employees should follow the below-mentioned procedure:\n<br>\n<br>• Comply with the robbers' demand.\n<br>• Do not make any sudden movement as it may provoke the robbers to use weapons or firearms.\n<br>• Remain quiet, unless directed to talk by the robbers.\n<br>• Do not attempt to disarm the robbers, as this may jeopardize many lives.\n<br>• The cashier may switch on the secret alarm that might be installed in the cash drawer, while also following the direction of robbers so that they do not get suspicious of him.\n<br>• Observe the robbers carefully, noting the physical characteristics like height, build, eye colour, hair colour, mannerisms, complexion, clothing, scar marks, or anything that can be helpful in their identification.\n<br>• Note the direction of escape, and the type and registration number of the vehicle used by the robbers.\n<br>• Do not touch any object that might have been touched by the robbers and restrict the movement of people in the area in order to preserve fingerprints and other possible evidence left by the robbers.\n<br>• Gather the details of the robbers from the people who have witnessed the event and record them in the crime report form, if available.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent the spread of disease-causing harmful microorganisms. Since cleaning process removes infections - microbes as well as dirt and soil, they are often the means to achieve hygiene. It is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion of health because of the risk of food poisoning. Kitchen Hygiene refers to maintaining the cleanliness of Kitchen equipment’s, surroundings and including personal hygiene.\n<br>\n<br><b>Sanitation\n</b><br>The word sanitation comes from the Latin word sanitas, which means “health”. Sanitation means creating and maintaining hygienic and healthful conditions. It is an applied science and relates physical, chemical, biological, and microbial principles to food, the environment and health. Sanitation is more than just cleanliness. Food or equipment can be free of visible dirt and still be contaminated with microorganisms or chemicals that can cause illness or food spoilage.\n<br>Sanitary practices and hygienic conditions are becoming more and more important because food is being processed, prepared and sold in larger volumes than before. Some microorganisms cause food spoilage and food-borne illness, but others are beneficial in food processing and preparation. Sanitation can reduce the growth of microorganisms on equipment and dirt on food. This can reduce contamination of food by microorganisms that cause food-borne illness and food spoilage. Sanitary principles also apply to waste disposal and can help reduce pollution and improve ecological balance.\n<br>\n<br><b>The benefits &amp; importance of a good sanitation program</b>\n<br>• Compliance with statutory regulations.\n<br>• Preventing food-borne illness outbreaks.\n<br>• Improving quality and shelf life of foods.\n<br>• Reducing energy and maintenance costs.\n<br>• Increasing quality and confidence.\n<br>• Improve the guest satisfactions\n<br>• Increase the revenue\n<br>\n<br><b>Kitchen Hygiene</b>\n<br>Kitchen hygiene is related to clean and maintain the surfaces and equipment of entire kitchen and very crucial part of total hygiene in the Food production areas. Carelessness in the cleanliness of any section of the kitchen could lead a risk of food poisoning. To make a kitchen safe and hygienic the following important points must be considered.\n<br>\n<br>• Kitchen floors should be cleaned (swept, mopped, scrub with detergent and rinse with hot and cold water) daily or each shift of operation if necessary.\n<br>• Ventilation should be thoroughly cleaned and wiped.\n<br>• Lighting's should be wiped with damp cloth.\n<br>• Walls, ceilings, doors, windows should be wiped and polished with right agents as per the routine.\n<br>• Put rubbish bins in appropriate locations and dispose of garbage frequently.\n<br>• Refrigerator, deep freezer, and cool rooms should be cleaned with lukewarm Soda water. Do not use soap or any other detergent powder.\n<br>• All kitchen (Kitchen appliances) manual and mechanical equipment should be cleaned with hot water such as food mixtures, miners, processors, slicers, grinder/ blender, etc.\n<br>• Still-rooms, working tables, cupboards and racks should be periodically cleaned.\n<br>• Chopping boards should be frequently cleaned and wiped.\n<br>• Kitchen store area must be checked and cleaned regularly.\n<br>\n<br><b>Food Hygiene\n</b><br>\n<br>Food hygiene is a scientific discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent food-borne illness. This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food can transmit disease from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Rules regarding food hygiene are:\n<br>\n<br>• Prevent contaminating food with pathogens spreading from people, pets, and pests.\n<br>• Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.\n<br>• Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill temperature.\n<br>• Coolers/ freezers and refrigerators should be cleaned frequently and store food at the proper temperature.\n<br>• Use safe water and raw materials\n<br>• Use clean and sharp blade knife and clean chopping board after each use.\n<br>• Labeling food to indicate when it was produced (or, as food manufacturers prefer, to indicate its “best before\" date).\n<br>• Equipment like spatulas, ladles, skewers, etc. are to be dipped into sanitize after each use.\n<br>• Food once cooked should be re-heated properly up to 70+* Celsius.\n<br>• Quick cooling of food is essential prior to the refrigeration or freezer.\n<br>\n<br><b>Personal hygiene for Food Handlers:\n</b><b><br></b><br>Personal hygiene can be defined as the study and practice of preventing illness or stopping it from spreading by keeping oneself clean. In Other words, personal hygiene refers to high Standard of personal cleanliness and appearance of the staff which is essential not only to prevent the spread of disease but also to win the respect of others because when we apply for a position in a hospitality industry, our appearance and cleanliness will be carefully noted.\n<br>Personal hygiene may be described as the principle of maintaining cleanliness and grooming of the external body. It is, in general, looking after yourself.\n<br>Employees who are ill should not come to work. They should not touch food or equipment and utensils used to process, prepare, and serve food. Food can carry several illnesses, including:\n<br>• Respiratory diseases, e.g., colds, sore throats, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis\n<br>• Gastrointestinal diseases, e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery\n<br>• Typhoid fever\n<br>• Infectious hepatitis\n<br>\n<br> Proper personal hygiene can be achieved by the following ways:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Bathing: </b>It is essential for all the food handlers to take a shower regularly and change undergarments daily, such as socks/stockings and briefs. Bathing not only removes visible dirt and germs but also helps eliminate body odour.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Hands:</b> Hands must be washed thoroughly and frequently with hot soapy water and dry hands with towels or under the dryer. Hand must be washed: -\n<br>• On entering food room and before handling food\n<br>• After going to the toilet\n<br>• After smoking\n<br>• After blowing nose\n<br>• After handling raw food\n<br>• After handling refuse\n<br>• After eating\n<br>• After using cleaning materials\n<br>\n<br><b>3.Fingernails: </b>Fingernails must be kept short. It should be cleaned regularly with a nailbrush, and nail varnish should not be worn.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Hair:</b> Hair should be washed regularly. It should be kept covered by wearing an appropriate chef hat. The men's hair should be kept short, as it is easier to keep it clean and also looks neater. Women's hair should be covered as much as possible. One should never scratch, comb or touch hair in the kitchen as germs could be transferred to the food via the hands or hair strand may fall in the food.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Nose: </b>The nose should not be touched when food is being handled. Avoid sneezing or coughing near food. Use a disposable tissue to wipe the nose.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Mouth:</b> Never touch the mouth or lips as germs in saliva pass from Fingers to food and table-tops. If food needs to be tasted during preparation, a clean spoon should be used and not the fingers or utensils used in preparation.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Ears:</b> The ear-holes should not be picked or scratched while in the kitchen as germs can be transferred into the food.\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Shoes:</b> Kitchen shoes worn exclusively for food duties should not be worn outside.\n<br>\n<br><b>9. Protective clothing:</b> Uniforms should be worn only at work and not at other times. They should be laundered regularly. Leisure clothes should be kept well away from the kitchen.\n<br>\n<br><b>10. Cuts, burns, and sores: </b>It is particularly important to keep all cuts, burns, and scratches of the skin covered with a waterproof dressing. Where the skin is septic, there are vast numbers of harmful germs. Such germs must not be permitted to get on food.\n<br>\n<br><b>11. Jewellery:</b> Rings, watches, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, etc. should not be worn while at work.\n<br>\n<br><b>12. Cosmetics:</b> Excess cosmetics should not be put while working in the kitchen.\n<br>\n<br><b>13. Habits: </b>Smoking, spitting anywhere, tasting of food using fingers or other activities, which brings hands and mouth directly in contact with food, should be strictly prohibited.\n<br>\n<br><b>14. Illness: </b>Any Illness should be immediately reported to the concerned authority\n<br>\n<br><br><b>BASIC RULES TO BE OBSERVED WHILE FOOD SERVICE\n</b><br>\n<br>A number of diseases can be spread due to unsanitary practices while serving food. These diseases\ncan be avoided by following certain basic rules of sanitation.\n<br>\n<br>Protecting food during service is very important. Food should be protected at all times from contamination by people, dust. flies as well as changes in temperature.\n<br>\n<br>1. Practice personal hygiene.\n<br>\n<br>2. Avoid handling food with your bare hands. Bread rolls, chapatis, papad, sugar cubes, salads,\ncold cuts. cheese. ice and even garnishes should not be touched. Always use a pair of tongs, spoon or plastic gloves to pick up these foods.\n<br>\n<br>3. Maintain temperature control. Food that is to be held during a long lunch hour should be\nkept at temperatures outside the danger zone. Potentially hazardous or high-risk foods may remain in the danger zone for a maximum period of four hours, after which they should be\nheld outside the danger zone.\n<br>\n<br>The temperature of food in the bain-marie or hot cupboard should be above 63°C and the temperature of food held in the refrigerated case should be 5 to 8°C or lower, depending on the nature of the food.\n<br>\n<br>4. Foods held on buffet tables must be kept at proper hot or cold holding temperatures. Check\nthe temperature of all foods with a probe thermometer.\n<br>\n<br>5. Do not re-serve leftovers that have been displayed on buffets. Foods on buffets remain on the table for several hours and are exposed to contamination by customers who may have coughed, sneezed or touched the food during the meal hour. The top portion of cold foods may get warmed by air and spoilage may begin. Therefore, after a buffet closes, consider all food articles on display contaminated and discard them.\n<br>\n<br>However, in a poor country like India, this rule is not practical and, therefore, the food handler should follow proper temperature control.\n<br>\n<br>6. Food which has once been served to a customer should never be re-served, for example, bread rolls, leftover butter, etc. Only foods that are not potentially hazardous and are packed or wrapped may be served again.\n<br>\n<br>7. Handle dishes and utensils in a sanitary manner. Plates should be held by the bottom or edge. cups by handles or bottoms, silverware by handles. Avoid touching the eating surface of crockery and cutlery.\n<br>\n<br>8. Single service items should be dispensed in such a way that customers remove one item at\na time without touching other items.\n<br>\n<br>9. Before food service begins, all service personnel should check serving dishes for any sign’\nof soil or improper cleaning.\n<br>\n<br>10. Do not serve food in chipped or cracked dishes.\n<br><br>\n<br><b>SPECIAL RULES FOR DINING ROOM WAITERS \n</b><br>\n<br>1. Avoid cross-contamination: Food and clean utensils may get contaminated by dirty plates and utensils if separate stations are not maintained for clean and dirty items. The waiter stations are reserved for clean utensils and food being served to customers, while side stands are reserved for used cutlery, crockery and garbage.\n<br>\n<br>Contamination may also occur when waiters serve food without washing their hands after wiping tables and bussing soiled dishes. These practices are harmful and workers must be made aware of the hazards.\n<br>\n<br>2. Clean and organise your waiter stations and do not use them to store personal belongings.\n<br>\n<br>3. Minimise handling of foods with your hands. Do not rearrange food on the plate unnecessarily,\n<br>\n<br>4. Avoid touching the food or mouth contact surface of utensils as bacteria from the fingers are easily transferred to food. Pick up utensils by the bottom, side or handles. Never pick up glasses or cups bv putting your fingers inside.\n<br>\n<br>5. Clean and sanitise all service utensils like plates, glasses, silverware, etc. Do not wipe it dry\nwith a cloth but allow it to air dry. Wiping with a towel or cloth will contaminate the wares.\n<br>\n<br>6. Store all service utensils correctly after they are sanitised. Flatware and serving utensils\nshould be placed face down. Place silverware in baskets with the cating ends down.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>SPECIAL RULES FOR BARTENDERS AND BAR WAITERS\n</b><br>1. Store and handle all drink mixes and food items properly. Keep drink mixes and cream refrigerated or on ice. Avoid handling cut fruit and cherries with bare hands. Wear plastic gloves while cutting fruit and use toothpicks to place the cut fruit in glasses. Keep fruit covered.\n<br><br>2. Clean and sanitise glasses, cutting boards, containers, scoops and spoons properly.\n<br><br>3. Clean and sanitise all equipment, bar tops, counters,shelves, refrigerators, etc. properly.\n<br><br>4. Keep the ice used for drinks clean. Store ice in clean covered ice bins. Use scoops or tongs for removing ice. Do not use the ice which has been used to chill cans and bottles in any drink.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

This article addresses the chemical contamination of foods, as opposed to microbiological contamination, which can be found under food borne illness.  Food can be contaminated or spoilt by any of the following sources and at any stage from the farm to the table till it is consumed. Sources of contamination of food include: \n<br>\n<br>Air, Water, Plant, Soil, Food handler, Machinery and Equipment, Sewage and Trucks or Carts during transport.\n<br>\n<br>Food contamination refers to the presence of harmful chemicals and microorganisms that can cause illness or injury in food when such food is consumed. Food contamination is a serious health problem that needs to be tackled. The effect of chemical contaminants on human health may sometimes be seen only after years of prolonged exposure at low levels, for example, carcinogens in food may build up in the body causing cancers. Unlike most microbiological agents, chemical contaminants present in food are not destroyed by thermal processing’s. Contaminants in food can be broadly classified into the following categories:<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Rodents urinate or leave their droppings behind which harbour several kinds of disease producing bacteria and are responsible for the spread of human diseases. Microorganisms such as bacteria yeasts and mold can enter food at any stage of processing from the farm to the table and contaminate it.\n<br>\n<br><b>Natural Toxins\n</b><br>Certain plants and animals may contain natural substances that are poisonous and may produce gastro-intestinal disturbances. Some may even prove fatal.\n<br>Naturally Occurring Toxicants in Plants\n<br>• Lathyrus Sativus or Kesaridal\n<br>• Soybeans\n<br>• Green Potatoes\n<br>• Argemone Seeds\n<br>• Mycotoxins\n<br>• Egrot\n<br>• Cereals &amp; Groundnuts\n<br>• Poisonous Mushrooms\n<br>\n<br><b>Sea Food Toxins\n</b><br>Mussels and Clams (Shellfish) Ocean mussels and clams may be poisonous during some periods of the year when they feed on small crustaceans who in turn have been feeding on dinoflagellates (single-celled organisms). These dinoflagellates are toxic algae that produce the heat stable toxin PSP (paralytic shellfish poison), which is extremely toxic to humans. Symptoms include itching, numbness of lips and tongue, muscular weakness and respiratory paralysis that can be fatal.\n<br>There are many natural toxins in foods, but most of these toxins cause toxicity only when consumed in excess. Small amounts of most of these may not be toxic; hence, toxins represent only minor hazards as compared to bacterial hazards\n<br>\n<br><b>Toxic Metals &amp; Chemicals\n</b><br>Metals, when consumed in excess of the requirements, could cause toxicity. These contaminants may be present in the environment and may accumulate during the different stages of food preparation. By the time food is ready to be consumed, it can reach levels that are toxic to humans. Some of the toxic metals are listed below.\n<br>• Selenium\n<br>• Zinc\n<br>• Lead\n<br>• Cadmium\n<br>• Cobalt\n<br>• Copper\n<br>• Tin\n<br>• Brass\n<br>• Fluoride\n<br>\n<br><b>Pesticide Residues\n</b><br>Pesticide spray residues may contaminate foods such as cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables. Pesticides may also get into foods through soil, water and air.\n<br>The improper application of pesticides like Aluminium phosphide or zinc oxide results in health hazards as these pesticides leave behind residues in the form of other compounds of aluminium or zinc metals. Other important chemicals are\n<br>\n<br>1. Arsenic\n<br>2. Barium\n<br>3. Mercury\n<br>\n<br><b>Presence of Extraneous Material\n</b><br>Contaminants present in food could be nail chippings, hair, stones, grit, dirt or other extraneous matter. Accidental contamination by metallic fragments and shards of glass may render food harmful. Some common metal fragments are stapler pins, flexible aluminium wire, metal curls and fine filings from canned food opened with a defective opener. Glass chips may enter food from broken glassware, or misuse of glass for taking out crushed ice.\n<br>Physical contaminants may be organic or inorganic. Organic contaminants include plant parts, debri, weeds, seeds, poisonous seeds of Dhatura, dead insects, excreta, uric acid, rodent hair, etc., while inorganic contaminants include lumps of earth, stones, dust, glass, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Processing &amp; Packaging Material\n</b><br>Most foodstuff available in the market today has been subjected to some form of processing and packaging. While processing and packaging may prolong the life of the product, the main purpose of packaging is to provide a physical barrier for contaminants. Processing and packaging contaminants are not present in raw food materials but are generated during the stages in processing like high temperature, fermentation, etc. Processing contaminants are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. Examples are nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and trans fat.\n<br>The level of these contaminants in processed foods can be minimised by regulating processes. Processing equipment’s may also contribute towards metal contamination through metal fragments from equipment’s like copper as well as lubricants, cleaning and sanitizing agents.  Although packaging materials help in keeping food free from contaminants, some are known to add contaminants to food. \n<br>\n<br>The chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA) used in plastic food containers and cans is known to leach from products and get absorbed in low concentrations by the human body and may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Phthalates are found in adhesives, cling films and some printing inks. They may be carcinogenic and are also linked to hormonal imbalances. Apples with little stickers stuck on them and any food wrapped in cling film could have been contaminated by phthalates. Small amounts of aluminium may pass onto food from cookware or packaging. Food contact materials should be checked for safety.\n<br>\n<br><b>Prevent Contamination\n</b><br>\n<br>Cross-contamination is the main reason for many food-borne illness outbreaks. Even if meat has been cooked correctly, meals can still become contaminated with pathogens if cross-contamination isn’t avoided in the preparation process.  Put simply, if raw foods come into contact with ready-to-eat foods, cross-contamination can occur.  \n<br>\n<br><b>Wash your hands\n</b><br>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water (warm or cold) and dry them:\n<br>• Before handling food\n<br>• After handling raw food – including meat, fish, eggs and vegetables\n<br>• After touching the bin, going to the toilet, blowing your nose or touching animals (including pets)\n<br>\n<br><b>Wash worktops, knives and utensils\n</b><br>Wash worktops, knives and utensils before and after preparing food, particularly after they've been touched by raw meat (including poultry), raw eggs, fish and vegetables.\n<br>\n<br><b>Use separate chopping boards\n</b><br>• Use a separate chopping board to prepare raw food, such as meat and fish.\n<br>• This is to avoid contaminating ready-to-eat foods with harmful bacteria that can be present in raw food before it has been cooked.\n<br>• Before reusing them, thoroughly clean and sanitise plates, utensils and cutting boards that have come into contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs.\n<br>• Chopping boards should be replaced if they are excessively scratched or damaged.\n<br>• Damaged chopping boards develop grooves that are hard to clean, making bacteria difficult to eliminate.\n<br>\n<br><b>Keep raw meat separate\n</b><br>• It's especially important to keep raw meat away from ready-to-eat foods, such as salad, fruit and bread.  \n<br>• This is because these foods will not be cooked before you eat them, so any bacteria that get onto the foods from the raw meat will not be killed. \n<br>• Store raw meat on the bottom shelf \n<br>• Always cover raw meat and store it on the bottom shelf of the fridge, where it cannot touch or drip onto other foods.\n<br>\n<br><b>Store Food in the Right Place\n</b><br>Where you store food plays a major role in preventing cross-contamination. When placing foods in the refrigerator, where and how foods are stored is incredibly important.\n<br>• Raw meats should always be stored on the bottom shelf. This eliminates the risk of juices dripping onto other foods and contaminating them.\n<br>• Raw meat, poultry and seafood should be stored in covered containers or sealed plastic bags to prevent their juices from dripping or leaking onto other foods.\n<br>• If you’re not planning on using meat within a few days of purchase, it should be placed in the freezer for defrosting at a later date.\n<br>• Meats and ready-to-eat foods should never be placed next to each other or on the same shelves.\n<br>\n<br><b>Food Safety Training\n</b><br>The best way to prevent cross-contamination, and the serious consequences it can cause, is to train your employees. Everyone who handles food in your business should have at least a basic knowledge of food-borne illness and food allergens, including:\n<br>• food-borne bacteria and what they need to thrive\n<br>• how food can become contaminated\n<br>• signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction\n<br>• the importance of good personal hygiene\n<br>• the importance of following food safety protocols and best practices\n<br>• the risks and consequences of cutting corners when it comes to food safety\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

To prevent food from spoilage or from causing illness, the following principles of proper food handling should be observed during purchasing, storage, preparation and service of food.\n<br>\n<br><b>Important Points to be Observed While Receiving &amp; Inspecting Deliveries\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Meat &amp; Poultry: This should be purchased from a plant which has an inspection certificate &amp; inspection mark on all products to be certain that only healthy animals have been slaughtered, and that the meat has been stored, handled and transported in a sanitary way.\n<br>2. Fish: All fish and shellfish should be from unpolluted water.\n<br>3. Eggs: Eggs must be at least grade B and should have clean intact shells.\n<br>4. Milk: Milk should be pasteurized and from an approved source.\n<br>5. Canned foods: Cans should be obtained from a plant having a licence. All cans should have the date of processing, code and licence number on it. When opening cans, always open the uncoded end.\n<br>6. Cereals and pulses: These should be checked for the presence of contaminants like presence of mud, stones, unwanted grains, mouldy grains and insects or insect droppings. Damaged and eaten grains or grains of uneven size should not be selected.\n<br>7. Fruits and vegetables: These should be checked for bruises and damage by insects. Only wholesome items at the correct stage of maturity should be purchased.\n<br>8. Spices, nuts and dry fruits: These should be checked carefully for insect contamination. All packets should be intact.\n<br>\n<br>Make sure food supplies are properly labelled. Discard any containers with missing labels.\n<br>Always select food of good quality and visit the suppliers occasionally to check on sanitary practices.\n<br>\n<br><b>FOOD STORAGE</b>\n<br>All catering establishments, irrespective of the volume of business handled, should have adequate, temperature-controlled storage facilities to protect food from any kind of spoilage. Temperature controlled storage facilities include a dry food store, refrigerated stores and deep freezers. Storage space required depends on quantity purchased.\n<br>These facilities will prevent the entry and multiplication of microorganisms and preserve the quality and palatability of food. Food will thus remain wholesome till it is consumed.\n<br>However, food cannot be completely free from microorganisms because of their ubiquitous nature. Complete sterilisation of food is therefore, neither practical nor necessary. What is needed is control over the duration and temperature of storage to prevent growth of microorganisms. This can be achieved by ensuring that food is not left in warm and moist places for indefinite periods of time. The golden rule for storing any kind of food is to keep it clean, covered, cool and whenever applicable, dry.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The three major storage areas to hold large stocks or for bulk supplies are:\n</i></b><br>\n<br>1. the dry food store for non-perishables (short-term holding) 10 to 21C\n<br>2. the refrigerated store for perishables (short-term holding) 1 to 4C\n<br>3. the freezer stores for perishables (long-term holding) —6 to —25C\n<br>\n<br>The stores should ideally be located in the north-east part of the building. This will prevent it from getting heated by the sun and will help in keeping it cool and well lit. It should be near the goods receiving area. The kind of storage facilities and amount of storage space required depends on many factors like the menu, the number of covers served daily, purchasing policies and frequency of deliveries.\n<br>The stores should not be humid or damp and should be pest proof.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>General Guidelines for Food Storage</i></b>\n<br>1. Wash items that need washing and prepare food for storage. Wipe cans.\n<br>2. Check frozen items to ensure that they are in a solidly frozen state before putting them in the freezer.\n<br>3. Rotate food supplies using the 'first-in, first-out' (FIFO) method. Goods should be placed in the order received. Date goods on receipt and place new deliveries in the rear of the store. The 'Best before' or 'Use by' date should be marked on products.\n<br>4. Store foods in areas designed for storage only and not in the kitchen and larder. Each storage area should be separate.\n<br>5. Keep all goods in clean wrappers or containers. Dirty wrappers attract pests and contaminate food. Use waterproof and airtight material. Check packets before storing them.\n<br>6. Keep storage areas clean and maintain a regular cleaning schedule.\n<br>7. Keep vehicles used for transporting food within the establishment clean.\n<br>8. Access to the food store should be restricted to prevent pilferage and to control stocks.\n<br>9. Periodic inspection and turnover of foods is necessary to check their condition,\n<br>10. Maintain appropriate temperature depending on the type of storage,\n<br>11. Avoid overcrowding of stored food and overstocking. Adequate air circulation and ventilation is necessary.\n<br>12. Food should be stored in the appropriate storage area to remain in a sound state, for example, if bananas are refrigerated, their skin darkens and they become unacceptable.\n<br>13. Food should be used as soon as possible because even under ideal conditions of storage there is loss in nutritive value, flavour and freshness.\n<br>14. Goods must be stored as soon as they are purchased. Potentially hazardous food items should not be left in the open yard or receiving area. They should be refrigerated or frozen immediately.\n<br>15. Separate areas should be made available for storage of equipment, cleaning materials and empty cartons/ packaging materials.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE DRY FOOD STORE\n</b><br>The dry food store should be airy, well lit, clean, protected from pests and from excessive moisture. All foods that do not spoil at room temperature are stored here, for example, whole cereal grains, pulses, flour, sugar, jaggery, oil, hydrogenated fat, canned foods and some fresh fruits and vegetables like apples, mangoes, roots and tubers, pumpkins and preserves like jams, jellies, papads and pickle.\n<br>The temperature in the store should range from 15 to 21C (60 to 70F). Ideal temperature for maximum shelf life of commodities is 10C (50F) and a relative humidity of 50 to 60 per cent.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE REFRIGERATED STORE\n</b><br>The term ‘refrigerated store' includes the domestic refrigerator, the reach-in refrigerator, the walk-in chiller, the cold room and refrigerated display cabinets.\n<br>Storage of foods at refrigeration temperatures retards bacterial growth but cannot undo any damage already done.\n<br>Perishable foods like raw meat, poultry, fresh fish, stocks, soups, gravies, milk and milk products, ground masala pastes, cooked cereals and some fruits and vegetables can be held for short periods in the refrigerator. The cabinet temperature should not exceed 4C.\n<br>The temperature range is normally one to 4C in this store. The double door refrigerator with a separate deep freezer has a wider temperature range of —18 to 5C. It has the advantage of maintaining a steady temperature because the number of times the refrigerator door is opened is reduced as there is a separate door for the freezer. This keeps frozen foods fresh for a longer time with minimum temperature fluctuations in the freezer. Nowadays, three or four- door refrigerators are also available to store perishable items separately. The advantage of having three or four separate cabinets for food storage is a wider temperature range, lesser chances of cross-contamination and absorption of odours, and a steady temperature.\n<br>The deep freezer of the domestic refrigerator has the lowest temperature and the crisper has the highest temperature. Bacteria, yeasts and molds grow more slowly at refrigerator temperatures as compared to room temperature, so although foods will spoil when they are refrigerated, the rate of deterioration is much slower because generation time is longer.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The maximum storage time in the refrigerator at ideal refrigeration temperature for some perishable foods\n</i></b><br>\n<br>Shellfish    1 day\n<br>Raw fish    2 days\n<br>Minced meat    1-3 days\n<br>Cooked fish    3 days\n<br>Poultry     2-3 days\n<br>Eggs     14 days\n<br>Meat     3—5 days\n<br>Milk     3-7 days\n<br>Curds     5-15 days \n<br>Paneer     5 days \n<br>Cream cheese     2 weeks \n<br>Processed cheese (open)     3-4 weeks\n<br>Cream     3 days  \n<br>Egg white     3 days \n<br>Egg yolk     3 days\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Ideal refrigeration temperature for specific foods\n</i></b><br>\n<br>Fish     -1  to 1 C\n<br>Meat and poultry     0 to 2C\n<br>Dairy products     3 to 4C\n<br>Fruits and vegetables     4 to 7C\n<br>\n<br>The temperature of the refrigerator should be checked regularly by placing a thermometer in the warmest part of the refrigeration unit. If temperatures below 50C are not maintained, it needs to be checked. The likely reasons for this inadequate cooling could be:\n<br>\n<br>1. opening the refrigerator door very often\n<br>2. leaving the door open for long\n<br>3. placing hot foods in the refrigerator\n<br>\n<br>The refrigerator should be cleaned inside out. Cleaning should coincide with defrosting. The time for cleaning should also coincide with the time when the refrigerator is relatively empty. This makes the task easier and minimises chances of contamination of food. All shelves and trays should be removed and washed in a warm soda solution, dried and replaced.\n<br><br><b>Operating Procedures\n</b><br>1. The refrigeration unit should be placed in an airy and well-ventilated place, away from any source of heat.\n<br>2. It should not be overcrowded as this hampers the circulation of cold air. \n<br>3. Milk and milk products should be tightly covered to prevent absorption of odour and should be kept away from foods with a strong odour. \n<br>4. Prepared food should be stored above and not below raw food, to prevent cross-contamination. Liquid from raw food may drip onto food which will not be cooked again (for example, fresh cream pastries).\n<br>5. Food stored in glass or metal containers should be stored in the lower part of the refrigerator to prevent condensation drippings from affecting other food items.\n<br>6. The refrigerator should be opened for the shortest possible time and the door should not be left open. \n<br>7. Liquids, meat, fish and poultry should be placed in the coldest part of the refrigerator closest to the coils. Foods to be stored for the longest time should be stored at the coldest temperature. \n<br>8. Food should be stored in clean covered containers and not in their original pack or can. Covering food protects it from cross-contamination, drying out and from absorbing odours. Aluminium foil and cling film are useful in covering food which has to be stored. Food should be wrapped only after it has cooled. \n<br>9. Do not use refrigerators to cool foods which are at high temperatures. The escaping steam will not only increase the frost formation on the coils but will increase the temperature inside the refrigerator, thus favoring growth of dormant microbes.\n<br>10. In walk-in coolers, store foods away from the walls and floor. Hang meat and poultry on&nbsp; hooks for better air circulation.\n<br>11. Do not refrigerate canned and bottled foods unless specified on the label.\n<br>12. The refrigerator should be defrosted regularly to prevent ice building up on the refrigeration&nbsp; coils. Additional ice on the coils reduces the efficiency of the refrigerator.\n<br>13. Green leafy vegetables and mushrooms should be stored in perforated polythene bags in the&nbsp; crisper to prevent spoilage by moisture accumulation in the bag. Extra moisture accelerates&nbsp; the growth of microorganisms.\n<br>14. Never use a sharp instrument to remove frost from the coils or frozen food that is stuck to\nthe coils, as this can damage them. Use a tray of warm water instead.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Chillers\n</b><br>Chillers are necessary in large catering establishments to reduce the temperature of large portions of food to 15C or lower in a short time of 1 1/2 hours. Once chilled, the food can be promptly refrigerated. The walk-in chilling room contains a refrigeration unit and a fan to circulate cold air.\n<br>\n<br><b>THE FREEZER STORE\n</b><br>The term 'freezer store' includes the commercial deep freezing cabinets, walk-in freezers, open top display freezers, blast freezers and the frozen food storage compartment of the domestic refrigerator.\n<br>The freezer store is used for preserving food for longer periods than the refrigerator, the temperature being so low that food turns into ice and is maintained in that state. This preserves the colour and flavour of food better than the refrigerator, especially if the food is blast frozen.\n<br>Most bacteria can survive the freezing process and remain dormant for many months or years in frozen foods. Only fresh, high quality food should be frozen because freezing cannot improve the quality of contaminated food. When frozen food is thawed and the temperatures reach the danger zone, the dormant bacteria start multiplying rapidly. Therefore, food should be thawed properly before being cooked.\n<br>Foods to be stored in the deep freezer should be at room temperature and wrapped in moisture-proof material to prevent dehydration and to keep odour and contaminants away. The wrapping should be airtight. All packets should be labelled and dated before being frozen.\n<br>\n<br>The temperature of the deep freezer varies from —6 to —25C or lower, as in the case of blast freezers. In blast freezers, it may be lower than —35C.\n<br>The function of some freezers, like the frozen food storage compartment of the refrigerator, is to hold already frozen foods.\n<br>The true freezer is capable of freezing fresh food and at the same time maintaining the temperature of the already frozen food kept in the freezer. The temperature range is -18 to -25C (0 to -15 F) and at these temperatures foods can be stored from one to 12 months, depending on the nature of the food. Such freezers have four-star rating.\n<br>A star rating system has been prepared on the basis of the temperature in a freezer or frozen food compartment of the domestic refrigerator.\n<br><br><b>Guidelines for Freezer Storage\n</b><br>\n<br>1. The temperature should be maintained at - 18°C to keep the food safe and the thermostat and the thermometer should be checked regularly.\n<br>2. Each time the food is thawed, microbes start growing and this damage cannot be rectified by re-freezing.\n<br>3. When thawed food is refrozen, the process of refreezing is relatively slow and results in the&nbsp;formation of large ice crystals which affects the texture of food when it is thawed again.\n<br>4. Frozen food should be well-packed to prevent freezer burn, cross-contamination and absorption of odour and flavour. Freezer burn is caused due to very low temperatures and results in discoloration and dehydration of the exposed food.\n<br>5. The temperature at which frozen foods are delivered should not exceed -15°C.\n<br>6. The freezer, unlike the refrigerator, should be tightly packed with frozen food as cold air circulation is uneconomical. In the open-top display freezer, food should not be stored above the freezer load line as temperatures here are higher than in the main freezer compartment.\n<br>7. In case of power failure or breakdown of the freezer, the freezer door should not be opened\nand the food should be left inside. A well-stacked freezer can keep food frozen for a day or more. If the surface temperature of the food is below 5°C, the food is safe. It is better to cook foods which have thawed and then refreeze them.\n<br>8. Lengthy freezer storage influences the taste, colour and texture of foods and increases the possibility of spoilage and contamination. The flavour of foods with a high fat content deteriorates faster than other foods.\n<br>9. Frozen foods should be put in the freezer immediately after delivery and only the quantities required should be removed.\n<br>10. The freezer should be adequately insulated, well lit and doors should have proper gaskets.\n<br>\n<br><b>Blast Freezing\n</b><br>This is a method of rapid deep freezing of packed cooked or uncooked foods by a continuous blast of cold air in a tunnel or chamber at temperatures as low as -40C. Because of the very rapid method of freezing, the quality of the product, i.e., its freshness is preserved. Quick freezing produces very tiny ice crystals in food which do not damage the cells. Once frozen, food should be stored at -20 to -30C.\n<br>Slow freezing forms large ice crystals which damage the cells and cause cell juices to drain out.\n<br>This results in loss of flavour, colour and nutrients,\n<br>The freezer is used to store raw meat, fish, poultry, pork, vegetables like green peas, fruit and fruit pulp, ice cream, etc.\n<br>Nowadays, frost-free refrigeration units are becoming popular as they do not require defrosting and can maintain the temperature at —20 to (0 —60 F), Horizontal, vertical and table top models are popularly used in catering establishments like hotels, restaurant« and industrial canteens, ice-cream parlours and fast food centres.\n<br>\n<br><b>STORAGE OF SPECIFIC FOODS\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Meat and meat products should be refrigerated soon after delivery at zero to 2C (32 to 36F). This temperature minimises and controls bacterial growth if meat is contaminated. Raw meat should be wrapped loosely for better air circulation. Cooked meat should be wrapped tightly. Frozen meats should be wrapped and sealed in moisture-proof paper or containers to prevent freezer burn. Cooked and raw meat should be stored separately. Larger cuts of meat should be hung in the cold room and nothing should be stored below. Trays which collect blood drippings should be washed regularly (once a day).\n<br>\n<br>2. Poultry is more perishable than meat and should be stored at zero to 2C. Whole dressed birds may be loosely wrapped in wax paper or aluminium foil and refrigerated for three days. Frozen poultry is stored at a temperature of -18C and should be cooked soon after thawing. It should be used within six months after processing.\n<br>\n<br>3. Eggs should be stored at 4 to 7 c (39 to 45 F). Always refrigerate eggs. Eggs stored in the refrigerator can stay fresh for two weeks as against three days at room temperature.\n<br>They should be stored with larger end up. At 20 C, eggs may be stored for 9-10 months. Treatment with pure, colourless, odourless mineral oil increases shelf life by several months. 4. Seafood should be stored at 0C (32F). Fresh fish covered with ice may be stored for three days. Crushed ice should be used as larger pieces bruise the flesh and enhance spoilage. If kept at  0C without ice, then fish should be used within 24 hours.\n<br>\n<br>5. Dairy products include milk, evaporated and condensed milks, butter, cheese, cream, etc. They readily absorb odours and should be kept away from strong smelling foods.\n<br>(a) Fresh milk should be stored in the cold room or refrigerator. Tops and sides of bottles and packets should be washed before storing. Lids of milk urns should be replaced after drawing the required stock. Milk kept at room temperature should not be poured back into refrigerated cartons. Milk should be stored at 3 to 40C for five to seven days.\n<br>(b) Milk powder should be stored at 10 to 21 C and can be stored up to one year if not opened. It should be refrigerated after opening.\n<br>(c) Butter and other fats (margarine) should be stored at 3 to 4C for two weeks.\n<br>\n<br>6. Vegetables should be stored at a temperature of 4 to 7C. Onions and potatoes should be stored in ventilated containers in a cool, dry, dark place. Potatoes and other root vegetables should be stored in sacks if purchased in bulk. As vegetables respire, they require ventilated storage. They should be stored on wire racks adequately above ground level. Cabbage and leafy vegetables should be used as soon as they are received or else emptied on the racks and refrigerated. They should be checked thoroughly if they are to be held for a day or two.\n<br>\n<br><b>Danger Zone\n</b><br>The food handler should always remember that food cannot be stored indefinitely as all food will ultimately spoil.\n<br>Bacteria are present everywhere. Even if one is careful and all attempts are made to prevent contamination, some bacteria will still find their way into food and contaminate it. It is therefore necessary to prevent multiplication and contamination at every step of food preparation with the help of appropriate time-temperature control.\n<br>Bacteria multiply over a wide range of temperature. The range of 5 to 63C (41 to 145F) is called the \"danger zone\" because the hazard of bacterial growth is great within this range. The golden rule of food protection is called time until it is ready to be served and temperature principle. It requires that all potentially hazardous food be kept at an internal temperature below 50C (41 F) or at an internal temperature above 630C (145F) during display and service. If, during periods of preparation, potentially hazardous or high risk foods must be exposed to temperatures between 5 to 63C, this exposure time must be kept to an absolute minimum. The longest period for which food may safely remain in this zone is four hours, but food should not be in the 15 to 490C range for longer than two hours.\n<br>\n<br><b>Recommended Food Storage Temperatures</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The purpose of serving delicious, nutritious meals prepared and served under hygienic conditions is totally lost if the water served along with it is contaminated. If safe drinking water is not available for consumption, it results in ill health.\n<br>Water meant for human consumption should be safe, clear and wholesome. Such water is referred to as potable water. It can be defined as water which is free from pathogenic agents, harmful chemical substances, odour and unpleasant taste &amp; suspended particles and which can be used for domestic purposes.\n<br>\n<br><b>CONTAMINATION OF WATER\n</b><br>The growth rate of most microorganisms slows down in pure water and they eventually die although spores may survive for months or years in water. Pathogens and viruses do not multiply in pure water. Water which has been freshly contaminated, or possesses a continuous Source of pathogens, is very harmful to health. Natural waters have a capacity to assimilate and transport waste. But these days, heavy water pollution has made self-purification a difficult process.\n<br>\n<br>Water can get contaminated:\n<br>1. at the source itself\n<br>2. by the addition of impurities during transit from source to reservoir\n<br>3. during distribution, through lead pipes conveying water or through cracks and joints in the piping. Water pipes should always be at a safe distance from sewage and gas pipes\n<br>4. when water is stored in underground or overhead storage tanks, barrels or containers\n<br>5. when innumerable or unclean containers are dipped in the water container\n<br>6. during service, if unclean ('lasses are used to serve water or by faulty methods of holding the glass\n<br>\n<br>Unpotable water can contaminate dishes, vegetables, etc. washed with it or ice made from contaminated water may render cold drinks harmful to health.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hardness of Water\n</b><br>Water is considered soft if it forms a lather with soap which lasts for at least five minutes. Water is considered hard when soap does not lather easily in it. This hardness is caused mainly by compounds of calcium and magnesium dissolved in it.\n<br>Hardness in water is further classified as carbonate and non-carbonate hardness. Carbonate hardness was earlier called temporary hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate. Non-carbonate hardness was earlier referred to as permanent hardness and is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium sulfates, chlorides and nitrates. Iron' manganese and aluminium compounds also cause hardness.\n<br>\n<br>Water is termed soft or hard depending on the level of hardness. Hardness in water is expressed in terms of milliequivalents per litre (mEq/I). One mEq/l of hardness producing ion is equal to 50 mg calcium carbonate (50 ppm) in one litre of water.\n<br>\n<br>In the hospitality industry, the type of water used directly affects food service, preparation, dishwashing, laundry and the maintenance departments,\n<br>Water used for consumption should be moderately hard. However, if hardness exceeds 3 mEq/l then softening of water is recommended because:\n<br>\n<br>1. the quantity of soap and detergent needed is greater in hard water\n<br>2. the colour and appearance of food is preserved in soft water\n<br>3. the carbonates in water precipitate out when water is heated and cause furring or scaling in boilers. This reduces their efficiency, increases fuel consumption and may sometimes cause boiler explosions.\n<br>4. the life of pipes and fixtures is shortened as they may rust\n<br>5. fabrics washed with soap in hard water wear out faster— they turn grey in colour and lose their texture.\n<br>6. when soluble soap is added to hard water a sticky insoluble curd is formed which gets deposited on bathtubs, buckets, etc. and is difficult to rinse off.\n<br>\n<br><b>Removal of Hardness <i>(For more detail ref. Facility Management)\n</i></b><br>Hard water can be softened by boiling, addition of lime or addition of sodium carbonate, the base exchange process and by demineralising it.\n<br>\n<br>1. Boiling is done to soften water on a small scale. Boiling removes temporary hardness of water. Carbon dioxide is expelled in this process and the insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO)3)2 ---Heat---&gt; CaCo3 + H2O + Co2 ↑\n<br>\n<br>2.Addition of lime removes temporary hardness of water and can be used for softening water on a larger scale. The insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out and the carbon dioxide formed is absorbed by lime.\n<br>In Clark's method of softening water, for each degree of hardness, one ounce (approx. 30 g) of quicklime is added to every 700 gallons of water.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(OH)2 + Ca(HCO3)2 ---&gt; (2CaCO3) + 2H2O\n<br>\n<br>3. Addition of sodium carbonate or soda ash removes both temporary and permanent hardness.\n<br>\n<br>Temporary hardness:\n<br>Na2Co3 + Ca(HCO3)2 ----&gt; 2NaHCO3 + CaCO3\n<br>\n<br>Permanent hardness\n<br>Na2Co3 +CaSO4 ----&gt; CaCO3 + NaSO4\n<br>\n<br>4. In the ion exchange process or zeolite process, hard water is passed through a tower which is packed with zeolite or ion exchange material. The sodium cations in the zeolite are exchanged for the calcium and magnesium ions in water and water is softened. The process continues till all sodium ions are used up and water is totally soft.\n<br>\n<br>The ion exchange material should be flushed at intervals with a concentrated solution of sodium chloride to replace the sodium that has been lost. The calcium and magnesium chloride that is formed is washed away. The soft water produced is remixed with a part of hard water to achieve the desired level of hardness.\n<br>Water softening units are fitted into the main water system near the point where water enters the premises.\n<br>\n<br>5. In the demineralising process, hard water is passed through a bed of synthetic demineralising resin. Softening of water is carried out in two steps.\n<br>    A. In the first step the hydrogen ions in the resin combine with the chloride, carbonate and sulphate ions and converts them into their respective acids, i.e., hydrochloric, carbonic and sulphuric acid.\n<br>    B. In the second step the acids formed are absorbed by the demineralising resin and pure soft water is obtained. This process is used to soften sea water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Impurities\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Natural pollutants\n<br>(a) suspended impurities like clay, silt, sand and mud\n<br>(b) dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and ammonia\n<br>(c) dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium salts, lead\n<br>(d) microscopic plants and animals\n<br>\n<br>2. Artificial pollutants\n<br>(a) sewage which contains decomposable organic matter and pathogenic agents\n<br>(b) industrial wastes, for example, toxic agents including metals, salts and complex organic chemicals\n<br>(c) agricultural pollutants, pesticides and fertilisers\n<br>(d) physical pollutants, for example, radioactive substances\n<br>\n<br><b>HAZARDS OF WATER POLLUTION\n</b><br>The health of an individual is affected by the consumption or use of contaminated water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Biological Hazards\n</b><br>Water-borne diseases can be caused by ineffective agents that could be present in the water, for example,\n<br>1. viruses: viral hepatitis and poliomyelitis\n<br>2. bacteria: cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis, infantile diarrhoea\n<br>3. protozoa: amoebiasis, giardiasis\n<br>4. helminthic infective organisms, for example, ova of roundworm, whipworm and threadworm\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical Hazards\n</b><br>These include pollutants derived from industrial and agricultural wastes, for example, detergents, heavy metals, solvents, minerals, organic acids, nitrogenous substances and other toxic compounds.\n<br>\n<br><b>PURIFICATION</b>\n<br>Naturally occurring water is seldom sparkling clear, free from bacteria or without any odour or objectionable taste. It needs to be purified before use. Impure water may be purified by either of the following methods:\n<br>\n<br>1. Natural method: (a) impounding or storage, (b) oxidation and settlement\n<br>2. Artificial method: (a) physical: distillation, boiling, (b) chemical: precipitation, disinfection or sterilisation, (c) filtration: slow sand filtration, rapid mechanical filtration, domestic filtration. Water may be purified at two levels: large-scale purification and small-scale purification.\n<br>\n<br><b>CRITERIA FOR JUDGING WATER QUALITY\n</b><br>\n<br>For hygienic purposes the examination of water is generally done along the following lines:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Physical Qualities\n</b><br>(a) Turbidity is measured on the Jackson candle turbidity meter. It should be less than five units.\n<br>(b) Colour is measured in a colorimeter and should be less than five units.\n<br>(c) It should have no disagreeable odour.\n<br>(d) It should be palatable and free from disagreeable taste.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Chemical Qualities\n</b><br>(a) Chlorides: maximum permissible limit is 600 mg/l but the standard is 200 mg/l of water.\n<br>(b) Hardness: total hardness should not exceed 300 mg/l water.\n<br>(c) Free and saline ammonia should not exceed 0.05 mg/ l.\n<br>(d) Albuminoid ammonia is a measure of decomposable organic matter that is to be oxidised. It should not exceed 0.1 mg/ l.\n<br>(e) Nitrites should be zero.\n<br>(f) Nitrates should not exceed 1 mg/l. It indicates old contamination.\n<br>(g) The amount of oxygen absorbed is an approximate test for the amount of organic matter present. Oxygen absorbed at 37o c in three hours should not be more than 1 mg/ l.\n<br>(h) Dissolved oxygen should not be less than 5 mg/ l.\n<br>(i) Toxic substances like arsenic, selenium, cadmium, lead and mercury should not exceed the prescribed limits.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Bacteriological Qualities or Indicators: </b>It is based on organisms indicating faecal contamination. (a) Coliform organisms include all aerobic, facultative and anaerobic gram negative, non-sporing, motile and non-motile bacteria capable of fermenting lactose at 35 to 37C in less than 48 hours. This group includes the faecal group (example, E. coli) and non-faecal group (example, Klebsiella aerogenes).\n<br>\n<br>The bacteriological quality of water is assessed on the basis of the coliform test. Water samples are collected in screw capped sterilised bottles. The test measures the most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria in 100 ml of water.\n<br>\n<br><b>WATER QUALITY STANDARDS\n</b><br>The WHO International Standards, 1971, relate five water quality variables:\n<br>\n<br>1. Microbial pollutants: standards for bacterial quality of treated water are\n<br>(a) throughout any year, 95 per cent of the samples should not contain any coliform organisms in 100 ml of water\n<br>(b) no sample should contain E. coli in 100 ml of water\n<br>(c) no sample should contain more than 10 coliform organisms in 100 ml water\n<br>(d) coliform organisms should not be detectable in 100 ml of any two consecutive samples of water\n<br>\n<br>2. Toxic substances: arsenic not more than 0.05 mg/l, cadmium not more than 0.005 mg/ l, lead not more than 0.05 mg/ l, mercury not more than 0.001 mg/ l, selenium not more than 0.01 mg/l.\n<br>\n<br>3. Specific substances that may affect health, like fluoride levels, should vary between 0.5 to 0.8 mg/ l.\n<br>\n<br>4. Characteristics affecting acceptability: the acceptability of water is affected by substances that cause discolouration, odour, taste, dissolved salts and affect the pH. All these should be within desirable limits set by the WHO.\n<br>\n<br>5. Radioactive substances: pollution of water by radioactive substances is on the rise and the WHO has set standards for acceptable limits.\n<br>\n<br><b>SEWAGE AND CONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY\n</b><br>\n<br>Sewage consists of human faecal matter diluted with water and other waste waters from the kitchen sinks and drains, dishwashers, laundry, wash basins, bathroom drains and waste waters from mopping, washing floors and garbage bins. It is approximately 99 per cent water and contains a large number of microorganisms, mainly bacteria from the intestinal tract and soil. Sewage contamination is harmful as it is a potential source of human pathogens, especially those that affect the intestinal tract. Persons who suffer from acute intestinal disorders excrete millions of virulent pathogens into sewage. Healthy people and carriers also contribute significantly to this microbial load. Sewage contamination can result in severe, widespread epidemics of communicable diseases. It can contaminate both food and water.\n<br>\n<br>Food gets contaminated when untreated sewage is used as a fertiliser in fields where vegetables are grown. Root vegetables, green leafy vegetables, salad vegetables, coriander leaves, celery and parsley are at a greater risk. This risk increases further when vegetables are not washed well, not peeled or are consumed raw in salads or as garnish. Coriander leaves used in green chutney has been responsible for the outbreak of several food-borne illnesses.\n<br>When untreated sewage is discharged into a body of water, the pathogens present contaminate the water and the food found in such waters. Improperly treated or untreated sewage spoils water because of the large number of microorganisms and high percentage of organic matter present in sewage. The microorganisms in sewage oxidise the organic matter. For the process of oxidation, oxygen from water is used up and the level of dissolved oxygen is reduced. Normally, water contains 7-8 ppm of free oxygen. This level promotes and maintains all forms of aquatic life.\n<br>When the level of oxygen falls to 3 ppm, anaerobic conditions develop which do not favour aquatic life. Fish cannot survive in low levels of oxygen and they either leave or die. Foul smelling products are produced by putrefaction and fermentation brought about by anaerobic microorganisms. This spoils the water and makes it cloudy, malodorous and unfit for human use.\n<br>\n<br>The drinking water supply in cities and towns may get contaminated with sewage in many ways. Sewage contamination may occur through a leak in pipes or water from sewage disposal tanks may seep into the soil and contaminate other sources of water.\n<br>A leak in sewer connections and improper plumbing in the food service establishment may be the cause of contamination of otherwise clean, and wholesome food and potable water.\n<br>\n<br>If water supply is inadequate or a water carriage sewage disposal system is not available —which may be the case in temporary food service establishments, at fairs or at remote tourist spots — some type of sanitary conveniences is necessary. They should be located well away from the kitchen and should have hand washing facilities. Various types of water closets may be used, like the chemical closet. It should have a cover and should be kept as clean as possible. These problems may also arise in villages, isolated buildings and small remote catering establishments.\n<br>Water samples should be sent for testing to the nearest public health laboratory before using water for consumption. Water can be purified by boiling and should be stored in clean containers and kept covered.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A cleaning schedule for all areas and departments should be planned to maintain clean surroundings.  \n<br>\n<br><b>CLEANING AND SANITISING\n</b><br>Before we discuss the procedures it is important to understand the difference between cleaning and sanitising.\n<br>• Cleaning is the removal of matter from a surface on which it is not acceptable. For effective cleaning, soiled surface should be in contact with a cleaning agent for adequate time and sufficient pressure should be applied if required, to remove the soil. Cleaning involves two steps: a wash step and a rinse step.\n<br>• Sanitising is a reduction in the number of diseases causing bacteria to safe levels. This is achieved through the use of heat or the application of chemical compounds. It involves one step only, a sanitise step.\n<br>\n<br><b>NECESSITY FOR AN EFFICIENT CLEANING PROGRAMME\n</b><br>Both cleaning and sanitising form the basis of food service sanitation.\n<br>The main purpose of cleaning and sanitising dishes is to remove visible surface dirt and reduce the number of bacteria to a safe level so as to\n<br>• reduce health hazards by avoiding contamination\n<br>• prevent spoilage of food\n<br>• control odour\n<br>• create a pleasing appearance\n<br>\n<br>Before any cleaning programme is implemented, it is necessary that all food service workers understand the importance of cleaning procedures. It is the duty of every employee to ascertain that all dishes and utensils used in the catering establishment are clean. Dishes are handled by various people like waiters, cooks and dishwashers. Dishes cleaned and sanitised by dishwashers may be mishandled and contaminated after washing. They may collect dust or get covered with a greasy film if they are not stored or handled properly.\n<br>An act of carelessness on part of one person, can cancel the painstaking efforts of others and result in wastage of costly detergents, money invested in machines, labour, etc.\n<br>It is important to note that no matter how well food is prepared and served, it is unacceptable if served in improperly cleaned dishes or accompanied by unclean crockery or cutlery, which retains the smell or remanent of the food served in it earlier.\n<br>Cleaning removes visible soil, sanitising reduces microbial load to a safe level.\n<br>All utensils, equipment, tableware and other food contact surfaces used in the food service operation must be cleaned and sanitised after every major use or at least once a day. Any utensil or equipment used in the storage, preparation and service of food and which touches the food directly, is a food contact surface. Pots, pans, dishes, glasses, cutlery, trays, mixer bowls, slicing machines, chopping boards, work platforms and stainless steel table tops are food contact surfaces which do not touch the food directly are non-food contact surfaces like the top of the refrigerator, the bottom of work platforms and tables, floors, etc. These surfaces need to be cleaned regularly and sanitised occasionally.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cleaning Agents\n</b><br>Water alone is not sufficient to remove dirt, grease or stains from food contact surfaces. For effective cleaning certain cleaning agents should be used. Cleaning agents include all materials that are required to effectively clean surfaces, dishes, utensils, equipment and machines in the kitchen. They include soaps, detergents and other chemical substances such as sanitisers and disinfectants. Cleaning tools like scrubbers, steel wool, brushes, etc., aid in the action of the cleaning agent.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Dish washing is one of the most important tasks in any food service establishment. Unfortunately, it is one of the most neglected areas. The job is usually assigned to the lowest grade of employees who are inexperienced, unskilled and do not understand the importance of using the right amount of detergent, water or time for this work. It is the responsibility of the management to select correct methods of dish washing and train employees accordingly.\n<br>Whether clearing dishes or cleaning premises, there has been a gradual perceptible shift from manual cleaning to mechanised cleaning machines. Dish washing machines have the following advantages and disadvantages.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Advantages\n</i></b><br>1. They can clean faster.\n<br>2. Lessen day to day financial expenditure.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. Initial investment is high.\n<br>2. Trained personnel are required.\n<br>\n<br>Both manual as well as machine cleaning have their own advantages and disadvantages and a wise facilities manager will weigh the pros and cons of both before taking a decision.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The method to be used will depend on many factors, such as the surface to be cleaned and the size and nature of the food service establishment.\n<br>Even if all dishes are machine washed, workers should be trained in manual methods as well. All methods listed above follow three basic steps, namely, wash, rinse and sanitise. All these steps are necessary for proper cleaning and sanitising.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Three Bucket Method\n</b><br>This method is used to clean and sanitise equipment which is too large to place in a sink or dishwashing machine or is stationary. Three separate buckets, containing a wash, rinse and a sanitising solution, are required. All buckets should have different colours.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedure for the Three Bucket Method\n</b><br>\n<br>1. Wash : Remove food scraps from the surface to be cleaned. In the first bucket, mix detergent in warm water. Scrub surface with a scourer to loosen food, grease and dirt.\n<br>2. Rinse: Take clean warm water in the second bucket. Wipe the surface with a sponge to remove loosened soil and detergent till surface is clean. If surface does not look and feel clean, repeat these two steps.\n<br>3. Sanitise: Add chlorine in the correct concentration to warm water in the third bucket. With a clean sponge, wipe the entire surface lightly and allow solution to air dry. Do not dry surface with a dishcloth. Large equipment is sanitised by rinsing carefully with boiling water, or live steam from a hose in case of equipment in which steam can be confined.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Sink Method\n</b><br>\n<br>Dishes, pots, pans, chopping boards, containers, knives, spoons and other small utensils are washed and sanitised in sinks. Sinks should ideally have three compartments so that washing, rinsing and sanitising can be done in separate sinks. A one or two compartment sink is not very hygienic as all steps are carried out in the same sink.\n<br>\n<br><b>Equipment required\n</b><br>\n<br><b>1. Sinks: </b>Three compartments with a hot and cold water supply are required. The sinks should be large enough to hold washing baskets and allow dishes to immerse completely in wash solution. They should be made of a non-toxic, non-corrosive, smooth material like stainless steel or vitreous enamel. Galvanised iron sinks are recommended for washing large pots and pans. The sink should have an overflow pipe to remove excess water. The pipe should be fitted with a strainer and funnel to remove food residue and prevent clogging.\n<br>There should be a slope near the drain for self-draining. The number of sinks required depends on the number and variety of meals served. Separate sinks should be used for crockery and cutlery and for pan washing.\n<br>Waste pipe traps should be removable, smooth, easy to clean and easily fitted. Plastic, which is acid and hot water resistant, is preferred. A spray hose fitted to the sink is a desirable feature to wash down the sink and the draining boards.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Drains: </b>They should be 10 to 15 cms (four to six inches) in diameter to remove all waste water without the risk of flooding. Grease traps should be cleaned regularly. \n<br>\n<br><b>3. Ware tables and drain boards: </b>They are necessary to hold soiled dishes before washing and to hold clean dishes after washing. They should be large enough, self-draining and should be so placed that they do not interfere with washing procedures.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Ware washing baskets:</b> They are used for immersing soiled ware in the rinse and sanitising compartments. They should have long handles and be large enough to handle the normal load of wares. They should ensure complete immersion of items and prevent contamination of cleaned and sanitised items by human hands.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Booster heaters: </b>They should supply hot water between 74 to 82c for sanitisation. They should ideally be located under the final rinse sink to prevent water temperature from dropping.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Thermometers:</b> They are meant for dishwashing and should be portable and accurate to within 20C.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Clock:</b> It is necessary to check immersion time during sanitisation and the clock should have a seconds hand.\n<br>\n<br><b>8.Cleaning tools:</b> Bristle brushes, scourers and abrasive pads in a good state of repair should be placed in a convenient place. Sponges should be avoided as they encourage the growth of microorganisms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Procedures for three Sink method\n</b><br>\n<br>Check that sink is properly clean before starting work.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Scrape and pre-rinse:</b> This is to remove loose soil from dishes and keep wash water cleaner and free from bacterial build-up. A scraper or squeegee is used and food residue is transferred to a garbage container. Sometimes, soaking may be necessary to remove more stubborn residues.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Washing:</b> The first sink contains a hot detergent solution at 43.5 C to 52C. Dishes are washed in this sink with the help of cleaning tools. All visible soil is removed from the surface of dishes. As more and more articles are washed, the effectiveness of the detergent is reduced. The detergent solution is no longer effective when a scum or grease layer forms on water and should be changed. Brushes and scourers should be cleaned, sanitised and dried' Grease is removed at 52 C.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Rinsing:</b> The second sink contains water at till washing solution other materials is removed and dishes are clean and touch. Rinse water should be changed when it becomes dirty. If a basket is used, dip entire basket all traces of detergent are removed. A basket must be used sanitise dishes because (a) it reduces hand contact with eating surfaces of and (b) temperature of water needed for sanitation is too high for the use of hands.\n<br>\n<br><b>4.Sanitising:</b> This step removes any soil and microorganism that remain after rinsing and has a bacteriostatic Sanitisers used may be chemicals or water at specific temperature and pressure. The concentration and duration of immersion should be strictly followed.\n<br>\n<br><b>5.Drying: </b>No item should be touched on the food or mouth contact surface. All items should be air dried to retain effects of sanitation. They can be left in the baskets to dry. Glasses should be inverted on a well ventilated drain board. Towel or dish cloth drying is not recommended.\n<br>\n<br><b>Mechanical Dishwashing\n</b><br>A dishwashing machine is used to clean and sanitise all plates, glasses, cups, saucers, knives, forks and spoons which are used in the dining area. Other equipment and utensils that fit in the machine can also be cleaned and sanitised.\n<br>The machines work automatically and are extremely useful where quantity food preparation and service takes place, as both time and labour are saved. For effective cleaning, it is necessary to follow the manufacturer's operating instructions carefully and to maintain the equipment in good working condition.\n<br>\n<br>Before selecting a machine it is essential to have the following details\n<br>• type of ware\n<br>• volume of dishes to be washed\n<br>• type of food service establishment\n<br>• space available for dishwashing\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of dishwashing machines\n</b><br>\n<br>Dishwashing machines are basically of two types:\n<br>• stationary machines\n<br>• conveyor machines.\n<br>\n<br><b>Stationary machines: </b>These machines have a single tank. The articles to be washed are suitably placed in the rack and the racks are lifted and placed in the machine. The rack Of dishes stays in one place while the wash and rinse solution circulates around the dishes. The timing is automatically controlled in most machines.\n<br>\n<br><b>Conveyor machines: </b>In the conveyor machine, the dishes move on a conveyor belt through the different cycles of washing, rinsing and sanitising. The dishes are either placed in racks on the conveyor belt or directly on the pegged conveyor belt.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Conveyor machines may have</i></b>\n<br>• a single tank where dishes are cleaned by the wash solution at one end and conveyed to the clean end of the machine where it activates fresh water at 82C (180F). Water is sprayed from nozzles above and below the dishes.\n<br>•  two tanks or multiple tanks: the first tank, i.e. the wash tank, contains the detergent solution. After the wash cycle, the rack is conveyed through the power rinse tank to rinse the dishes free of most of the detergent solution. The rack then passes through the final rinse for sanitisation. The racks are transported through the machine on a pre timed conveyor at a speed set by the manufacturer. These machines are recommended for larger establishments.\n<br>Loading of dishes may be done from the top or side of the machine, depending on the model. Dishes are cleaned in a machine either by a jet or spray of hot water and detergent, forcefully sprayed to remove soil; by revolving brushes that scrub soil off the dishes; or by mechanically agitating the detergent solution to help in removing soil.\n<br>\n<br>Steps in dishwashing Before beginning the cleaning operation, it is essential that the machine, dish tables and work area is clean. Some preliminary steps which should be checked are:\n<br>\n<br>•  Check the insides of the machine to ensure that no food soil, broken dishes or other foreign objects are present.\n<br>•  Overflow pipes should be free of debris.\n<br>• Spray arms should be clean and properly installed.\n<br>•  Inspect final rinse nozzles and see that they are not blocked.\n<br>• Make sure sufficient detergent is present in the dispensers.\n<br>•  Keep scrap bins and strainers in place.\n<br>\n<br><b>Operating procedure</b>\n<br>The following steps should be adhered to for successful cleaning:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Sorting: </b>Set aside any dishes that require special handling, as well as heavily stained dishes which will not get cleaned by the routine cleaning process in the machine.\n<br><br><b>2. Preliminary scraping and pre-rinsing:</b> Remove excessive loose food particles with the help of a rubber scraper. The purpose of scraping is\n<br>•  to prevent the clogging of spray nozzles with food particles\n<br>• to avoid frequent changes of wash water\n<br>•  to reduce bacterial contamination of wash water\n<br>•   to remove as much grease as possible prior to washing\n<br>•  to wet the soil remaining on the dishes\n<br>•  to facilitate easy cleaning\n<br>Manual pre-rinsing is not required if the machine has a power pre-rinse attached.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Soaking: </b>This may be necessary for dishes on which soil has hardened or dried, especially flatware may need soaking for some time to loosen the soil. Soaking can be done in tubs placed under the counters or ware tables.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Racking: </b>In this step, the dishes are arranged either in racks for conveyance through the machine or on a pegged conveyor for travel through it. It involves proper placement of dishes to permit the wash and rinse solution to come in contact with all surfaces to be cleaned.\n<br>\n<br>Cleaning is most effective and breakages are reduced to a minimum when\n<br>a) there is no overcrowding of dishes\n<br>b) similar sized objects are racked together\n<br>c) cups and glasses and other deep dishes are placed open end down to prevent water accumulation\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Washing:</b> The purpose of washing is to remove all food soil from the dishes and dissolve the grease on dishware. This requires clean water, with correct proportion of detergent at the right temperature and pressure, in contact with the dishes for the proper amount of time. The detergent solution circulates at a specific rate as the dishes pass through this tank. The temperature of the washing solution will vary according to the type of the machine and its specifications.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Power rinse: </b>It completely removes most of the detergent-laden water and permits effective sanitisation. Because of the build-up of heat, it hastens the drying process. Hot pumped rinse water is sprayed over the dishes in the correct volume and with sufficient pressure to rinse\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Final rinse and sanitisation:</b> At this stage, any remaining detergent is removed and the dishes are sanitised. If water is used as a sanitiser, then it should be sprayed in adequate volumes and at a correct pressure with temperatures varying between 77 and 82C. Ideally, as it leaves the nozzles it should have a temperature of 82C. However, it should not exceed 90 to 930C, as the water at that temperature under pressure would atomise and become vapour.\n<br>\n<br>The hotter the water used for sanitising, the faster the drying and lesser chances of water spotting. A drying agent may be injected in this cycle.\n<br>If chemical sanitisers are used, dishes should be immersed for at least one minute at concentrations mentioned in below image\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Drying: </b>Crockery and utensils must be left in racks to drain and air dry.\n<br>\n<br>Although dishwashing machines are a boon to us, they can create problems if not selected well. Some of the common causes of failure are:\n<br>• machines located in the wrong place\n<br>• improper plumbing\n<br>•  machines are too small\n<br>•  untrained employees\n<br>• water is not adequately hot\n<br>•  water pressure is low\n<br>• wrong selection of detergent\n<br>\n<br><b>While selecting a new machine the following points should be kept in mind:\n</b><br>•  select a machine from a reliable, standard company\n<br>•  two small machines are better than one big one. During slack periods only one machine can be operated, or if one machine breaks down, the other can be used\n<br>•  number of operators required and the kind of technical knowledge they must possess to operate the machine\n<br>•  whether servicing the machines needs outside technicians or can it be serviced by available staff\n<br>•  the power consumption\n<br>•  clean-ability and durability of the material used and the design\n<br>•  whether the machine is silent or noisy when switched on\n<br>•  whether large trays and glasses can be washed in it\n<br>•  whether it has a detergent feeder fitted in\n<br>• whether there is a strainer pan to collect food debris<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Contamination of cleaned and sanitised ware should be avoided.\n<br>\n<br><b>General Rules for Hygienic Storage and Handling\n</b><br>• There should be clean place for storage of cleaned and sanitised ware. Store all items either on clean dry shelves or in cart racks. Dusty or dirty shelves will quickly re soil cleaned and sanitised items.\n<br>•  Handle items as little as possible, taking care not to touch food or mouth contact surfaces.\n<br>•  Storage area must be dry and above the floor. Splashes from mopping solutions or food spillage, exposure to dust or floor dirt from sweeping must be avoided.\n<br>•  Pans or containers stored on low shelves should be placed inverted or covered.\n<br>•  Utensils etc. should be hung in a self-draining position on hooks or racks.\n<br>•  Glasses and cups should be inverted on racks or on shelves.\n<br>•  Silverware should be placed in perforated plastic containers to dry. Cutlery should be picked up by the handle.\n<br>\n<br><b>DISH CLOTH\n</b><br>Drying cloths should be used only when necessary. They should be changed frequently and washed and boiled each day. The dish cloths themselves carry many germs and the wise operator will realise that the germs may be passed back onto cleaned and sanitised crockery and utensils. The use of disposable absorbent paper for final drying can be considered, if affordable. Cloths for mopping should, if used, be boiled frequently or soaked overnight in a disinfectant solution.\n<br>\n<br><b>CLEANING OF PREMISES &amp; SURROUNDINGS\n</b><br>\n<br><b>The Cleaning Schedule\n</b><br>Cleanliness is an essential part of the daily routine in all areas and departments in any catering establishment. It is the key to good health and efficient work. The cleaning schedule should be carefully planned so that the premises, all equipment, furniture and surroundings are thoroughly cleaned every day.\n<br>The cleaning schedule should not interfere with or hamper the regular working in the establishment.\n<br>The cleaners should be familiar with the work programme and should strictly adhere to the time-table. Any spillage or accidental mess should, however, be cleaned up promptly. This will prevent accidents and grease spots forming on floors.\n<br>\n<br>A surface is clean when it is free from dust, dirt, grease, stains, cobwebs or any such unacceptable element.\n<br>To remove soil from any surface it is necessary to select the proper cleaning technique. This will depend on the type of soil present. Soil can be removed by\n<br>•  Sweeping.\n<br>•  Dusting or damp dusting with a cloth tightly wrung in a multipurpose cleaning solution.\n<br>•  Washing with water and a cleaning agent.\n<br>•  Friction using an abrasive agent.\n<br>•  Suction using a vacuum cleaner or wet pick-up machine.\n<br>•  Pressure using a scrubber or polisher.\n<br>•  Force by using water or air.\n<br>•  Solvents for removing grease and stubborn stains.\n<br>\n<br>The cleaning schedule should be prepared for daily, weekly and monthly cleaning. Special cleaning, like outside windows, light fixtures, walls which require washing, polishing, distempering and painting of surfaces, is carried out a couple of times a year. The general rule for cleaning is that there should be no large-scale sweeping and cleaning while food is being prepared, as sweeping raises dust laden with microbes which contaminates food.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Floors\n</b><br>Floors in areas where traffic is heavy, as in kitchens, bakeries, pantries, dish washing rooms, walk-in refrigerators, corridors, dining rooms, washrooms and toilets, should be cleaned everyday. Floors in areas where traffic is light can be cleaned weekly.\n<br>All washable floor surfaces should be washed. Wooden floors should be waxed or polished. Hot water, soap or detergent, a scrubbing brush and a mop is needed. Before cleaning the floor all movable light equipment and furniture must be shifted. The floor is best washed at the end of the day. Floors in the pantry, larder, dry food store and vegetable store should be swept daily and washed at least once a week. Fixed carpets and matting in dining rooms, passages, stair ways should be brushed or swept every working day, preferably by a vacuum cleaner. Loose mats and rugs should be vacuum cleaned or taken out into the open and beaten at least once a week. Carpets should be shampooed or dry-cleaned at least once a year.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Walls and Ceilings\n</b><br>Walls and ceilings should preferably be non-porous and in good repair. This helps the cleaning procedure and prevents pests from breeding in cracks and crevices. While cleaning the walls and ceiling, follow the principle of cleaning the uppermost areas first. Walls, ceilings and fixtures should be cleaned at least once a week. Areas within reach should be dusted every day. The method of cleaning will depend on the surface to be cleaned. Ideally, walls should be washed with warm water and a detergent. The ceilings should be brushed and swept. The girders, piping, electric fittings, etc., should be dusted. Dusting should be done carefully so that dirt is not shifted from one place to another. The best way of removing dust is by using a vacuum cleaner or by damp dusting as it prevents dust from flying about. All walls must be dusted. Walls that become heavily soiled or spattered daily should be washed. All walls should be free of dust, moisture, grease, cobwebs, grime and mildew. Light coloured walls make dirt more visible. Painted walls should be repainted regularly and papered walls should be kept in a good state of repair with no loose paper.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Kitchen Tables, Counters and Preparation Slabs\n</b><br>Kitchen tables, counters and preparation slabs should be washed at least once a day. All surfaces coming in contact with food should be cleaned after each service by the three bucket method. All metal surfaces should be cleaned with hot water, a non-scratching detergent and by a hand swab. Wooden and marble surfaces should be scrubbed with a scrubbing brush, hot water and detergent. The surfaces should be rinsed well and wiped with a clean cloth every time they are used. Such cloths should be washed well and boiled.\n<br>They should not be used for wiping dishes. All parts of tables, including the framework and underside, all areas of the counter, like the hot cupboard, and all preparation areas including chopping boards and pastry slabs should be cleaned at least once a day. The bain-marie (hot food serving counter) should be turned off and the water drained off. It should then be cleaned inside and outside with hot detergent water, rinsed and dried every day.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Shelves and Cupboards\n</b><br>Selves and cupboards that are constantly in use should be tidied and cleaned once a week. Shelves and cupboards are mainly used for storing ingredients or utensils. They should be first emptied and then swept or dusted. The upper surfaces of the shelves should be scrubbed and lower surfaces should be dusted. While cleaning, always start with the topmost shelf. Cupboards which are used for storing reserve crockery, linen, etc. i.e. long-term storage cupboards, should be cleared out and cleaned at least once a month.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Cleaning of Surroundings and Drainage\n</b><br>The entire working premises should be thoroughly cleaned once a week. This should be done after the dining area is closed. All edible items should be covered and put away. All easily movable articles should be removed. This procedure helps in putting things back in place and prevents accumulation of rubbish. Cleaning is thus made easier.\n<br>All furniture should be thoroughly dusted at least once a day and table tops scrubbed clean. If table cloths are used, they should be changed. Walls, ceilings, fittings and fixtures should be swept or dusted at least once a week.\n<br>All passages and staircases, whether used to carry food or used by customers, should be cleaned frequently, and any spillage should be mopped up at once. All nooks and corners should be swept out and cleaned thoroughly once a month.\n<br>Any open space outside the building should be swept and washed every day. No rubbish should be allowed to collect in the drains or else drains will get blocked, give off foul odours and encourage pests.\n<br>\n<br><b>Drainage</b>\n<br>Drains should be adequate to remove all wastewater without being overloaded. Each drain should have a water seal or trap which will prevent unpleasant odours rising from the pipe into the room. Drain pipes should have a diameter of 10 to 15 cms and should be cleaned regularly. They get blocked mostly because food accumulates on the sides and blocks the pipes. Blockages can be cleared by using a rubber water plunger. If not cleared then the cleaning eye at the bottom should be opened. The drain can be cleaned with a flexible wire or a cleaning liquid especially available for blocked drains.\n<br>Grease traps are necessary because they prevent grease from congealing in the drainpipes &amp; STP. The grease tray should be removed regularly and washed out.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

With the advancement of science, there is now a better understanding of the various sanitary practices, chemical treatment and better facilities are available to enable effective pest control. A vigilant food service worker can play an important role in protecting food from contamination and wastage and in maintaining the reputation of the catering establishment.\n<br>\n<br><b>IMPORTANCE OF PEST CONTROL</b>\n<br>\n<br>1. Contamination Contamination of food leading to food poisoning and other serious diseases in humans, is a major hazard of a pest infestation. This is so because pests move from dirt to food and transfer harmful microorganisms to it.\n<br>\n<br>2. Legal Requirement According to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (1954), if any food article consists either wholly or in part of any filthy, putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal or vegetable substance or is insect infested or is otherwise unfit for human consumption it is deemed to be adulterated. Serving adulterated food is punishable by law.\n<br>\n<br>3. Wastage and Destruction Ten per cent of the world's harvested cereals are destroyed by rodents and insects, which if saved could feed 260 million people. Rodents are known to destroy pipes, insulation and cables. Termites and textile pests cause grave damage to the woodwork and upholstery. Beetles, weevils and warehouse moths destroy commodities, making them unfit for consumption. Rodents contaminate much more food with their hair and droppings than they actually eat.\n<br>\n<br>4. Reputation The reputation of any catering establishment depends largely on the prevailing hygienic conditions. Flies hovering over uncovered food and insect body parts and droppings found in food can be very repulsive to the consumer, thus damaging the establishment's reputation. Hence, proper sanitary practices and pest control measures would go a long way in building up goodwill among customers and in turn will improve financial gains.\n<br>\n<br><b>CLASSIFICATION OF PESTS\n</b><br>Pests commonly found in a catering facility can be divided into the following categories:\n<br>* Insects which include houseflies, fruit flies, cockroaches, silverfish, firebrats and stored grain insects.\n<br>* Rodents which include rats and mice; and animals and birds which include cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Housefly\n</b><br>The housefly is one of the filthiest of pests and is found all over the world. It has a hairy body, three pairs of legs, each having a pad with glandular hairs. Secretions from these pads enable dirt and germs to stick to it, which is later transferred to food, equipment or any other surface it lands on.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>1. Environmental sanitation can be achieved by proper disposal of garbage, decaying food and animal carcasses and other wastes.\n<br>2. All food wastes should be held in tightly covered bins and preferably refrigerated to reduce decay and fly activity. Clean garbage containers thoroughly.\n<br>3. Protective display of food using fly proof cupboards, wire gauze covers, etc., should be practised.\n<br>4. Adequate fly proofing of doors and windows of kitchens and food service areas helps prevent their access to food. Self-closing doors and windows prevent their entry.\n<br>5. Air currents or curtains protect the establishment from the entry of insects and dust. They are mounted outside and above the door.\n<br>6. Various insecticidal sprays, aerosols and pellets are effective in controlling fly populations in kitchens and food service areas.\n<br>7. Poisonous baits and fly strips are a combination of an insect-attracting food like sugar and an insecticide. Since they are poisonous, they should be used and stored with care. They are recommended for outdoor use.\n<br>8. Swatting with fly swatters is not recommended in preparation, storage or service areas. Swatters are contaminated and spread dead insects and their body parts when they are used\n<br>9. Insect Light Traps (ILTs) - All species of flies are naturally attracted to UV-A light. This property is made use of in attracting and trapping flies\n<br>10. The flying insect catcher also attracts insects by emitting UV-A light but traps them onto two glue boards; one placed at the back of the trap and a second at the bottom of the trap.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Fruit Fly\n</b><br>These are seasonal, coloured and smaller than the housefly. They are most attracted to overripe and decaying fruit. These pests are not attracted to sewage and other wastes, hence transmit less number of microorganisms.Their larvae eat their way through different fruits and spoil them\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>1. Check fruit supplies for signs of infestation.\n<br>2. Get rid of decaying fruit and other fermenting foodstuffs.\n<br>3. Use screens, wire meshes and air currents to prevent their entry.\n<br>4. Electric fly traps, to a certain extent, are useful in exterminating them.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Cockroaches\n</b><br>The cockroach is another resilient pest known to man. It is filthy and gives off a foul odour. Cockroaches contaminate unprotected food, utensils and other surfaces. They travel from sewers to garbage dumps. En-route, they collect numerous disease-causing microorganisms on their bodies and in their stomachs. Uncontrolled cockroach infestations could spread diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid fever, intestinal worms and food poisoning.\n<br>\n<br>Control Measures\n<br>1. Persistent efforts at maintaining good sanitary conditions is the key to cockroach control. Covering dustbins at night, keeping food service areas free from dirt and food particles as well as prompt garbage disposal are essential.\n<br>2. All cracks and crevices should be properly sealed.\n<br>3. Good lighting and ventilation prove to be a deterrent to pests favouring dark, damp places to rest and breed.\n<br>4. Protect food from contamination by proper storage. Scrutinising bags and sacks for insect eggs and body parts, helps check the entry of these pests into the premises.\n<br>5. Permitted insecticides should be applied to cracks and crevices, undersides of tables, cupboards, equipment, behind sinks and other areas likely to harbour these pests.\n<br>6. Cockroach traps should be installed over drains. over a drain\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Ants\n</b><br>These common but annoying pests are known to mechanically transmit diseases from excrement to food. Ants cause immense wastage of food by eating some of it, thus making the food unfit for human consumption. They are known to destroy crops and also eat into wrappers.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures</b>\n<br>1. Good sanitary practices should be followed.\n<br>2. Food should be kept covered.\n<br>3. Suitable pesticides should be applied.\n<br><br><b>5. Stored Grain Insects\n</b><br>Some of the insects in this group include: flour beetle, rice weevil, granary weevil, the Indian-meal moth, saw-toothed grain beetle, lesser grain borer and angoumois grain moth.\n<br>These insects are like beetles with a long snout. They attack and destroy stored grains. The female grain weevil punctures the grain with her snout and lays an egg in each hole. The grub or larva burrows into the grain and eats away a part of the grain. They cause heavy losses and damage to the quality of the grain.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures</b>\n<br>1. All food items should be properly inspected before entering the storage area, for weevils, larvae, webbing or agglutinated grains and damaged packaging.\n<br>2. Thorough cleaning and drying of all containers before storing fresh food articles is necessary.\n<br>3. Discard contaminated food.\n<br>4. The rule first-in-first-out should be followed for all commodities.\n<br>5. There should be good ventilation, ensuring that storage areas are kept dry and cool.\n<br>6. Insect-proofing of bags: a solution containing insecticides is sprayed on the outer surface of the gunny bags in which grains are stored. This remains effective for six to eight months.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Rodents\n</b><br>It is mainly the rats and mice belonging to this group that trouble human kind. Equipped with a pair of sharp, chisel-like teeth, they gnaw into plastic, cardboard and other thin food containers. Rats are voracious eaters and are known to destroy food grains and standing crops. They devour eggs, attack poultry and their burrowing habit causes structural damage to buildings.\n<br>\n<br><b>Rodent infestation can be detected by:\n</b><br>1. Odours which emanate from their urine.\n<br>2. Marks left behind from gnawing and their claws. Their presence can also be ascertained by their foot marks in spilt flour, dust, etc.\n<br>3. Sounds they make while eating and scurrying about. Their presence during the day is a sign of a heavy infestation, as they are otherwise sensitive to light and prefer to come out in the dark.\n<br>4. The 'runs' are runaway marks they make from their breeding places to the source of food and water. These pathways are dark and greasy due to the grease found on the rodent's body. Finding these trails helps in placing baits and traps near the breeding places.\n<br>5. Excrement in the form of droppings are a sure sign of their presence. In fact, the size of the droppings helps determine a rat or a mice infestation.\n<br>The rat stool is larger (20 mm or 3/4 inch) than the mouse stool (6 mm or 1/4 inch). Fresh shiny stools confirm their presence in the establishment.\n<br>6. Burrows which are seen in places surrounding the building, like fences, spaces in the foundation and pathways, also indicate their presence. t!\n<br>7. The presence of rodent carcasses is an indication of a prevailing rodent menace.\n<br>\n<br><b>Control Measures\n</b><br>Effective rodent-control is possible only if the food handler is made aware of all the steps involved and the sequence in which prevention and elimination should be carried out.\n<br>\n<br>1. Deny entry: Rodents gain entry through open drains, doors, windows, ventilators, openings around water pipes, sewers, by burrowing around weak construction points and faults in the foundation.\n<br>\n<br>2. Deny breeding space: Store rooms and kitchens provide perfect sanctuaries for rats and mice. Rodent's preferences for dark, dirty, undisturbed places would imply that ample lighting, good housekeeping and high standards of tidiness could get rid of their breeding areas.\n<br>\n<br>3. Making the environment less attractive to rodents: This can be achieved by protecting the food supply using wire meshing and by keeping sacks of flour off the floor and away from the wall. Floors and work surfaces should be properly cleaned to remove dust, scraps of food, crumbs and wastewater, in order to cut off the food and water supply to rodents.\n<br>\n<br>4. Trapping: using traps is an effective method of eliminating a rat population. Using a number of traps, locating their 'runways' and placing two traps in opposing directions and at an angle of 900 to the wall to catch them moving to and from their nests, ensures the trapping of maximum number of pests.\n<br>\n<br>5. Poisoning: after ascertaining the rodent’s food preferences by 'pre-baiting', prepared baits should be placed along walls in runaways. Depending on how severe the infestation is, a number of baits should be used at regular intervals. Covering these bait stations with metal or cardboard covers prevents them from getting accidentally mixed up with food and also gives a sense of security to the 'suspicious' rodents. Once the baits are in place, all other sources of food and water should be inaccessible to these pests. Using gloves while handling baits and thorough washing of hands after the operation should not be neglected.\n<br>\n<br><b>Other Pests\n</b><br>Animals and birds, whether pets or stray, should not be allowed to enter an area where food is prepared, stored or served. Cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons may present problems for the catering establishment.\n<br>Domestic animals are carriers of ticks and mites and enteric pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonellae. Like humans, Staphylococci are found on the skin and nose of dogs and cats. Their presence is indicated by their droppings and signs of rubbish strewn around garbage bins.\n<br>Birds carry mites and many harmful microorganisms. They peck at food and damage packages. The presence of bird droppings and loose feathers in or near food is obnoxious. They can be controlled by\n<br>\n<br>• installing screens on windows, doors and ventilators\n<br>• discouraging the entry of animals in the premises\n<br>• discouraging the practice of feeding leftovers to animals in the premises proper storage and disposal of garbage\n<br>\n<br><b>Green Pest Management (GPM)\n</b><br>GPM is a pest control strategy using organic or plant based materials or materials of natural origin. It is an extension of integrated pest management and is looked upon as an eco-friendly pest management system. sometimes non-organic substances are also used in GPM if they are non-toxic and do not have a polluting effect on the environment, for example, insect bait stations that have synthetic active ingredients may be termed green. This is because the process of applying the product is also important in GPM.\n<br>\n<br>GPM is a proactive mode of controlling pests unlike conventional pest control that focuses on use of pesticides. Exclusion of pests, environmental changes and physical trapping are some of the non-pesticide measures used. GPM is considered to be the most advanced form of IPM and includes continuous training of technicians on common pests, inspection or identification of pests, latest developments in pest control measures, understanding its habits and biology, diagnosing and correcting pest friendly conditions, effect use of new products and sealants, proper inspection of the building and rectifying inlets.\n<br>GPM strategies work with a long-term vision and finding more permanent solutions to pest control while minimising the use of toxic pesticides and educating the public that green products are not necessarily very costly, but are beneficial in the long run.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Wastes arising from catering establishments are broadly classified into three groups: solid wastes (garbage and refuse), liquid wastes (sewage) and gaseous wastes (smoke and fumes).\n<br>Solid wastes in the form of refuse and garbage is the major waste which arises from the catering industry. They pose a problem in disposal to the caterer. Liquid wastes are normally disposed through sewers provided by the municipality in towns and cities and gaseous wastes are expelled into the atmosphere where they get diluted by diffusion and air currents. It is essential to collect and dispose of all types of waste separately as they are easier to deal with if they are kept separate.\n<br>\n<br><b>SOLID WASTES</b>\n<br>\n<br>Apart from the usual trash and litter like empty cartons, tins and boxes, solid wastes from the food industry include agricultural wastes like unusable portions of plant and animal foods resulting from food production. Solid wastes should preferably be sorted into biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes, and stored separately. They may be compacted or concentrated before disposal. Agricultural wastes can be used as feed or fertiliser after appropriate treatment.\n<br>Refuse refers to any waste material, either non-food or swill. Non-food waste from the kitchen includes all cans, bottles, paper bags, polythene bags, lids, cardboard cartons, etc. From the service area, single service items, paper napkins and straws, toothpicks, etc. also contribute significantly to the overall solid waste matter.\n<br>\n<br>If waste is allowed to accumulate it is dangerous to health. This is because of the following reasons:\n<br>1. Organic portions of solid waste ferments and gives off foul odours\n<br>2. Piled up waste favours the breeding of insects and rodents, especially flies\n<br>3. Pathogens present in waste may be conveyed to humans through pests and dust.\n<br>4. It may pollute the water supply.\n<br>5. There is a risk of air pollution in case of accidental or spontaneous combustion of rotting refuse because of the production of gas.\n<br>6. Hogs, cattle and dogs feed on garbage and spread it still further.\n<br>7. Heaps of refuse lying around is an unattractive sight.\n<br>\n<br>It is therefore necessary that the refuse from catering establishments is properly collected, stored and disposed of in a sanitary manner. If it is not disposed of immediately, then it should be stored in proper containers in a cool place. Garbage should always be kept well away from food, utensils and food preparation, storage and service areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Collection\n</b><br>Refuse should always be collected from the place where it is produced, i.e. near pre-preparation tables, meat blocks, kitchen sinks, dishwashing area, pantry table, etc. It can be collected in small bins or swill bowls. Nowadays, modern work tables are fitted with garbage bins on a trolley placed underneath the table. The waste can be immediately pushed off the table into the bin.\n<br>All small bins must be emptied into a large bin outside the kitchen at least twice a day or whenever the bins are full.\n<br>\n<br><b>Storage of Garbage\n</b><br>It is important to store garbage correctly before it is disposed of. It should not be left overnight near the kitchen area. The kitchen area is warmer than the other areas and decay is faster near the kitchen. The ideal storage area is in a yard behind the premises. Garbage should be filled in bins and these bins should be kept in the coolest place. Care should be taken to ensure easy cleaning and absence of pests. The garbage storage area should be large enough for the amount of garbage that will accumulate.\n<br>In large establishments and places where it is not disposed off frequently, it is stored in the basement at low temperatures.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Garbage Bin\n</b><br>The garbage bin should have the following characteristics:\n<br>1. it should be made of metal, preferably galvanised\n<br>2. stoutly constructed and durable\n<br>3. painted or treated with bitumen to prevent rusting\n<br>4. unridged\n<br>5. covered with tightly fitting lids, preferably with a clip to prevent the lid from blowing off.\n<br>6. leakproof\n<br>7. pestproof\n<br>8. easy to clean\n<br>9. of the correct size\n<br>10. adequate in number\n<br>\n<br>Cleaning the Bins Garbage bins may be used in rotation. They should be cleaned often. A tap, a pipe and a drain should be provided near the disposal area. After the bins are emptied they should ideally be rinsed with warm water and scrubbed with a long handled brush using soap and disinfectant. The floors of the disposal area should be clean and free from any spilt refuse.\n<br>Kitchen waste and plate scrapings should be collected in closed containers or a strong polythene bag or disposable cartons. To check pilferage, transparent bags may be used.\n<br>After the bag is full, it should be tied up.\n<br>These can be directly emptied into or placed in the main bins at regular intervals. This waste should never be carried through the dining areas. The containers should always be covered and cleaned thoroughly as soon as they are empty.\n<br>\n<br><b>Methods of Disposal\n</b><br>After refuse is collected, it is important to dispose it off in such a way that it does not create any nuisance.\n<br>The variety and quantity of waste products to be disposed off has increased tremendously with improvement in the standard of living and the population explosion.\n<br>Waste arising from catering establishments is mainly composed of biodegradable or organic matter (biomass). This waste needs prompt disposal because it is highly perishable and decomposes rapidly, giving rise to foul odours and encouraging the growth of microorganisms and pests.\n<br>Before selecting a method for proper disposal of wastes, it is necessary to understand the value of the waste matter which is to be disposed off and the nuisance it is likely to cause if improperly disposed.\n<br>\n<br>The methods of disposing garbage may be broadly classified as follows.\n<br>Land-filling, burial, composting, incineration, mechanically disposing, bio gas plants, vermiculture and recycling.\n<br>\n<br><b>Land filling\n</b><br>Dumping Refuse is dumped in low lying land or in land depressions like pits and hollows for reclaiming low lying land. This is the easiest method of disposing of dry refuse. Bacterial action reduces the volume of the refuse and gradually converts it to humus. This method however, has the following disadvantages:\n<br>1. loose refuse may be dispersed by wind\n<br>2. garbage is exposed to flies and rodents\n<br>3. it is unsightly in appearance and produces an unpleasant smell\n<br>4. surface water as well as ground water may get polluted\n<br>\n<br><b>Burial </b>This method is suitable where the volume of garbage produced is small. A trench is prepared to collect the garbage. At the end of the day the refuse is covered with 20 to 30 cm of earth. Alternate layers of refuse and earth are formed. When the trench is filled up till it is only 40 cm deep, it is filled with earth and sealed. A new trench is then dug. Chemical, bacteriological and physical changes occur in the buried refuse. It takes approximately four to six months for complete decomposition of organic matter into an innocuous mass. Temporary food service establishments set up in open areas should dispose of garbage by this method.\n<br>\n<br><b>Composting </b>This is a method of combined disposal of refuse and sludge. Sludge is the solid precipitate in the sewage tank which settles at the bottom.\n<br>Animal and plant wastes are rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can be returned to the soil by composting. Wastes of biological origin contain high amounts of water and are digested anaerobically by microorganisms in the absence of air. The waste is decomposed and stabilised by bacteria and fungi to form a humus like material called compost. Compost is rich in nutrients and fertilises the soil.\n<br>During this breakdown carbon dioxide, water and heat are produced. The heat produced is over 600C for several days. This destroys larvae and eggs of flies and other pathogenic organisms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Incineration</b> It is a hygienic method involving burning of refuse and converting it into harmless waste. It is burned in a specially constructed incinerator. The incinerator should be maintained in perfect working condition.\n<br>The incinerator should have a tall chimney and sufficient draught of air for efficient combustion, without creating a smoke nuisance.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages</b>\n<br>1. If refuse does not burn properly, too much offensive smoke is produced which, in turn, pollutes the air.\n<br>2. Organic nitrogen which could have been returned to the soil is converted into inorganic nitrogen and is returned to the atmosphere.\n<br>3. This method cannot be used during the rainy season or if the refuse is wet.\n<br>4. Although incineration is ideal from the sanitary point of view, it is costly compared to other methods and the fuel and fertiliser value of the waste is lost.\n<br>\n<br>Any presence of fine ash makes burning difficult and therefore dust or ash should be stored separately. In this method no manure is formed.\n<br>The volume of refuse is reduced to one-fourth its original weight. The residue is a mass of hard material called clinkers and is used for road making. The cost of transporting refuse is minimised. This is one of the best methods of garbage disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Mechanical Disposers</b>\n<br>Mechanical disposers include pulpers or disintegrators and mechanical compactors.\n<br>These can be installed in catering establishments and are useful because they help in reducing the volume of garbage and the number of garbage bins required. These methods require access to a drain, water for cleaning and a power source.\n<br>Pulpers or disintegrators The latest way of disposing kitchen waste as soon as it is produced is through an automatic garbage disposal machine. This is also the quickest and most hygienic way of garbage disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disposal of Biodegradable Wastes\n</b><br>Bacteria act on organic matter and decompose it either aerobically or anaerobically. In aerobic decomposition complete combustion of organic matter takes place. This happens in vermiculture.\n<br>In anaerobic decomposition incomplete combustion takes place and is accompanied with the production of methane gas. If anaerobic conditions are created in garbage heaps, ponds or septic tanks, a foul odour emanates because of gas formation. This principle is made use of in the production of biogas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Vermiculture\n</b><br>Vermiculture is a cheap, practical, innovative technology which conserves the humus content of the soil. This is achieved with the help of the earthworm Pheretima olongata. Aerobic bacteria multiply in the gut of the earthworm and decompose waste like sugars, starch, cellulose and protein into humus and simpler forms which can be easily assimilated by plants. The burrowing action of the worm tills the soil ten times deeper than the traditional slough. It increases porosity and aeration by breaking up the soil.\n<br>The worm feeds on garbage and excretes it as manure, known as vermicastings, which is a highly enriched kind of biofertiliser and contains hundreds of tiny earthworm cocoons to continue the process. It restores fertility to degraded soils and wastelands. Vermiculture can be done in a garbage bin in the kitchen. All food waste is chopped or crushed and spread in a layer in the bin, or on the soil in garden beds or special beds to which vermicastings have been applied.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio-sanitizer</b>\n<br>The bio sanitizer along with garden waste is yet another way of converting wet biodegradable waste arising from kitchens into rich organic manure. It has been proven to be the simplest, most cost effective, least labour intensive and most environmentally friendly method of converting biodegradable waste into useful good quality manure. This can be done on a large scale in bins or on a smaller scale in a pot or in one corner of the garden.\n<br>\n<br><b>Advantages\n</b><br>1. The biosanitizer is to be used only once when the bin is started.\n<br>2. Sujala is also put in the watering can only once.\n<br>3. No turnincy of waste is required.\n<br>4. Rich manure can be harvested once a year and the same bin can be re-used.\n<br>5. The cost of biosanitizer and Sujala is a one-time investment and is affordable.\n<br>6. Garbage can be treated at the source where it is generated and there is no dependency for its storage and disposal.\n<br>7. Enriched, organic manure is obtained instead of allowing garbage to spread and rot in the bins or on streets.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio gas Generation\n</b><br>Human excreta, animal droppings and plant and agricultural wastes can be processed in a biogas or gobar gas plant to produce fuel gas and rich manure. The plant consists of a circular tank shaped like a well. The tank is divided into two sections by a partition wall. It is covered on top by a cylindrical dome for the collection of gas.\n<br>\n<br>The two main products formed by anaerobic digestion are\n<br>1. fuel gas, which is approximately 55 per cent methane and 45 per cent carbon dioxide\n<br>2. manure, which is rich in nitrogen and humus.\n<br>\n<br>The gas produced can be used for cooking, lighting and running engines. Many companies are working towards large-scale production of biogas and manure from refuse collected by municipal corporations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Recycling\n</b><br>Recycling is the reprocessing of waste products so that they can be re-used.\n<br>Recycling food waste One way of utilising the energy from waste food is by using it as feed for pigs and poultry. It should be collected separately, taking care not to mix other refuse like cans, broken glass, etc. Waste food may be used for preparation of poultry feed after it is boiled well, shredded, dried and enriched with minerals. Destruction of all pathogens should be ascertained, otherwise they may find their way into the flesh of animals and ultimately reach the food consumed by humans. Recycling non-biodegradable waste All kinds of glass, plastic, polythene, paper and metal can be recycled. Each of these items should be collected in separate containers or bags and sent for recycling. This will drastically reduce the volume of garbage to be disposed off daily and indirectly reduce pollution.\n<br>The use of recycled plastics is, however, not permitted in the food industry.\n<br>\n<br><b>LIQUID WASTES OR SEWAGE</b>\n<br>Liquid wastes or sewage includes wastewater from sinks and drains from the kitchen, dishwashing areal laundry, bathrooms, toilets and other drains from the building and yard which is normally carried away by underground sewers.\n<br>It contains human excreta, chemicals like detergents, pesticides and oil and clean up wastewater rich in nutrients from animal and vegetable foods. It is one of the most dangerous sources of human pathogens and should not come in contact with food, water, utensils, equipment or any other food contact surface.\n<br>Sewage must be kept separate from other wastes because of the possible presence of human intestinal pathogens and the importance of guaranteeing their destruction. Disposal of sewage in a sanitary manner thus forms a pre-requisite for good food sanitation.\n<br>As far as possible, sewage should be disposed of in a public sewerage system or in a manner approved by the health authority. Care should be taken to prevent contamination of the ground and water supply and to keep all pests away. The temporary food service establishment operator needs to take special care.\n<br>In catering establishments located in towns and cities, sewage is removed through a system of underground sewers and drains called the water carriage system. These sewers take the sewage to a far off place away from the city. Before it is disposed of, it is treated in sewage treatment disposal farms or modern sewage treatment plants.\n<br>If the water carriage system is not available, sewage is treated in specially constructed septic tanks. Sewage should be treated before it is disposed of to reduce the possibilities of pollution and contamination.\n<br>Kitchen and wash up area wastewater should not be allowed to stagnate, if sewers or drains are not available. This water could be filtered and drained into the subsoil through a simple soakpit.\n<br>\n<br><b>Plumbing\n</b><br>Proper plumbing in a sanitary manner is essential to good food sanitation as it prevents sewage contamination of food in preparation and storage areas.\n<br>Problems commonly encountered with faulty plumbing are:\n<br>\n<br>1. leak in sewer pipes\n<br>2. cross-connections with potable water pipes\n<br>3. back flow of raw sewage\n<br>4. blockages or choked pipes\n<br>\n<br>Plumbing is necessary to safely carry sewage and liquid wastes from the catering establishment to the sewage disposal system and prevent any problems leading to contamination of food and water.\n<br>\n<br><b>GASEOUS WASTES</b>\n<br>Gaseous wastes include strong fumes originating from food being cooked and smoke from the kitchen, especially when wood or coal is used as cooking fuel. Gaseous wastes are a problem in the tandoori and barbecue sections of the Indian kitchen.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Even if wholesome food is selected, microorganisms are still present in and on food not all food items served on the menu are cooked, for example, salads and normal cooking procedures destroy most pathogens but not necessarily spores or toxins.\n<br>\n<br><b>Preparing Food\n</b><br>Procedures in Food Preparation The procedure to be followed will depend to a large extent on the food being prepared. Some common procedures which affect the microbial count are as follows:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Cleaning: </b>Cereals and pulses are picked before they are milled or cooked, to remove grit, mud, stones, husk, mouldy and insect-infested grains. Green leaves are separated from the inedible roots and tough stalks.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Washing:</b> Most foods need to be washed before preparation with potable cold water. Washing removes extraneous matter like surface dirt, soil and preservative and pesticide residue.\n<br>Fruits and vegetables to be consumed raw should be washed in a solution of 50 ppm chlorine for five minutes or in a dilute solution of potassium permanganate. Leafy and salad vegetables should be washed thoroughly.\n<br>Jn case of suspected or worm infestation, soak fresh vegetables like cauliflower in cold salted water for twenty minutes, If insects are present they will rise to the surface. Wash the body cavity of poultry well. Let all washed items drain well.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Pre preparation:</b> This step includes peeling, trimming and soaking. Potable water must be used for pre-preparation and cooking. Fruits and vegetables need to be peeled, trimmed and cut to remove inedible or spoilt parts. Grains are soaked for sprouting. Potable water should be used for all pre-preparations. No food or food container should be placed on the floor as the floor is heavily contaminated. Keep all food on racks or shelves.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Thawing:</b> Frozen foods should be thawed completely before cooking, unless the manufacturer, instructions are otherwise. Thawing large portions of food, joints and poultry takes time. Freezing only prevents bacteria from multiplying, it does not kill them. When a food thawed, these dormant microorganisms start multiplying rapidly once again.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Rules for Thawing Food Thaw or defrost food in any one of the following ways:\n</i></b><br>1. in the refrigerator below 40 C (39 F)\n<br>2. in a thawing cabinet at temperatures between 10-15C\n<br>3. in potable running water at 21c or below while it is still in the packet\n<br>4. in a microwave oven, only when it has to be cooked immediately\n<br>5. as part of conventional cooking, for example, certain frozen foods like frozen vegetables and ready-to-eat chicken preparations are cooked in the frozen state and quickly thaw when they are cooked.\n<br><br><b>Hot Holding of Food\n</b><br>In most commercial kitchens food service continues over a period of three to four hours during the busy lunch hour. In such cases it is more convenient to store food hot at temperatures above the danger zone, instead of cooling and reheating it every time before serving. For this purpose, a bain-marie or a hot cupboard is used. This equipment’s are heated by gas or electricity. Care should be taken that the internal temperature of the food should be above 63 C to prevent growth of bacteria. They should be pre-heated before placing hot food in them. They are not suitable for reheating cold foods as this process would take a lot of time to reach the safe temperature of 63 C and food would remain in the danger zone till then, permitting rapid multiplication of bacteria.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cooling Food\n</b><br>Any perishable food which is not to be consumed immediately should be kept outside the danger zone. Cold preparations like desserts should be cooled as soon as possible to 15C and stored in the refrigerator. Food should not be refrigerated while it is still hot, otherwise the maximum internal temperature in the refrigerator of 4C would increase and favor spoilage of other foods stored in the refrigerator. Food must be cooled prior to refrigeration in the coolest part of the kitchen. Large volumes cool faster when divided into smaller portions or when kept in shallow containers. Cooling can be hastened by keeping food containers in ice-cold water or in quick-chill units. Food cools faster when the container is placed in water, as water is a better conductor of heat than air. Stirring food occasionally brings about a uniform drop in temperature and faster cooling.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Other factors which influence the cooling process are\n</i></b><br>1. the type of food\n<br>2. the temperature in the refrigerator or quick-chill unit\n<br>3. the container used —size of container, material it is made of and covering if any.\n<br>\n<br>Cooked food which is not to be consumed immediately, should be refrigerated within 1 1/2 hours at 40C or below. If refrigerator space is inadequate, it is wise to purchase a quick-chill unit or extra bain-maries for ice chilling. Large catering units should have walk-in chillers for rapid cooling of cooked food.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hot Foods\n</b><br>To maintain high culinary quality, food should be prepared when it is needed and served as soon as it is prepared. But this situation is not feasible in most catering establishments as the volume of production is enormous and volume of sales cannot be accurately predicted. To serve hundreds of lunches in a two-hour lunch break, calls for preparing most of the items on the menu in advance. Foods which have to be served over an extended lunch hour can be held hot with the help of a bain-marie, double boiler, steam table or chaffing dish. The food handler should understand that these gadgets are not meant for reheating food but only for hot-holding of foods. If used for reheating, food will remain in the danger zone for a longer time.\n<br>The temperature at which food remains in the hot-holding equipment is very important and should not be less than 63C. If this temperature is not maintained, it is likely that food spoilage will occur rapidly. Before keeping food in any of these equipment’s, it should be heated to 74C (165 F) and transferred immediately.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>The following precautions should be taken during hot holding of foods:\n</i></b><br>1. keep food covered to prevent heat loss\n<br>2. check temperature with a thermometer and not by just touching it with hand\n<br>3. stir food occasionally for even heating as lower surfaces get heated and upper surfaces get cooled by air\n<br>4. use proper serving equipment like long-handled ladles and scoops to minimize hand contact. Keep ladle in a clean place when not in use\n<br>5. prepare and keep only required amounts as extended heating will affect flavor and quality\n<br>6. dry preparations like chapatti’s, fried items and baked items may dry further or get overcooked during hot holding\n<br>\n<br><b>Storage Temperature of Prepared Foods\n</b><br>The Food Hygiene (Amendment) Regulations, 1990 and 1991 have introduced a complex set of controls over the storage temperatures of prepared foods. Foods are divided into two categories, some of which should be kept at 8C or less and some that should be kept at 5C or less. All hot foods must be kept above 63C. There are exemptions from temperature control for limited periods of time for foods freshly prepared on site or on display for sale in catering outlets. The 5C temperature requirement became effective on 01 April, 1993.\n<br>\n<br>Though chilling helps in extending the shelf life of food products, it can be effective only when high standards of hygiene are observed. The caterer should store all perishable products below 5C as soon as possible. The same chilled storage temperatures are applicable to food in large delivery vehicles. Small vans making local deliveries are allowed to operate to a standard of 8C for all foods, even those in the 5C category. Caterers should check temperatures on receiving deliveries. An allowance of 2C in the temperature is given for up to two hours for the following:\n<br>\n<br>1. defrosting of equipment\n<br>2. breakdown of refrigeration equipment\n<br>3. during cold food preparation in the kitchen\n<br>4. when food is moved around on the premises\n<br>Exemptions for certain foods from temperature control\n<br>1. Certain foods are processed in such a way that it prevents the growth of pathogens, for example, sterilized canned food. Canned foods which have been only pasteurized should be refrigerated and this should be indicated on the label.\n<br>2. Sandwiches with perishable fillings can be held at 8C or below for a period of 24 hours only.\n<br>3. Mawa or Khoa should always be refrigerated and used within 24 hours.\n<br>\n<br><b>PREPARATION OF SPECIFIC FOODS</b>\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Meat\n</i></b><br>Meat is a highly perishable food and gets contaminated from various sources by the time it reaches the kitchen. It should be washed and trimmed if required before it is cooked. Separate knives, cleavers and chopping boards should be used for raw and cooked meat to reduce chances of cross-contamination.\n<br>\n<br>Bacteria from raw meat may remain on improperly washed equipment and if the same equipment is used for cutting ready-to-eat meat, like cold cuts which are eaten without further cooking, the chances of food poisoning occurring become very high. The bacteria on the raw meat are likely to get destroyed once meat is cooked. After handling raw meat, wash hands well before touching cooked meat or any other ready-to-eat foods which are not going to be heated again.\n<br>In the butchery, work table surfaces should be made of impervious material which is easy to clean. The chopping block can be made of hardwood and should be light enough to be removed for cleaning, scraping and rinsing after every use. While deboning meat and making rolled joints, chances of contamination increase. Such joints should be cut into small portions and cooked well to kill microorganisms that may be present in the centre of the cut.\n<br>\n<br>Minced meat is at a higher risk than meat because microorganisms present on the outer surface of meat get distributed throughout the entire mass of mince. Minced meat is also handled more and spoils much faster, leading to discoloration and foul odors and may cause food-borne illnesses. To reduce the chances of spoilage, the following precautions should be taken:\n<br>\n<br>1. mince the quantity required for the day only\n<br>2. cook mince thoroughly at sufficiently high temperatures\n<br>3. surplus mince should be cooled rapidly in small portions\n<br>4. refrigerate surplus immediately\n<br>5. reheat mince thoroughly before serving\n<br>6. if root vegetables like potatoes, carrots or onions are cooked along with mince, clean them thoroughly to remove heat-resistant soil organisms.\n<br><br><b><i>Fish\n</i></b><br>The best way to prepare fish is to place a stone slab long enough to fit across the sink used for fish preparation and about two-third the width of the sink. Place a hard wood board on it for cutting fish. This arrangement allows a continuous flow of clean water with the wash water going down the drain of the sink.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\n</i></b><br>Vegetables should be thoroughly washed to remove all traces of soil. If necessary, root vegetables may have to be soaked for some time and scrubbed clean as soil may contain Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli along with other intestinal pathogens. Some vegetables, like carrots and ginger, may be scraped, fruits should be washed well and peeled if required before they are served. Peeling helps in reducing microbial load and preservative or pesticide residue if any.\n<br>Green leafy vegetables should be washed under running water. Lettuce should be broken up and washed. Leaves should be drained well. A separate sink should be allotted for vegetables and fruit preparation. Spoilt, inedible portions should be removed.\n<br>When food is handled carelessly it is likely to get contaminated or spoilt and may result in food poisoning.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Dept.  But since hospitality units require quite large amounts of water they are required to have buffer stock of water and for which large tanks and reservoirs are required. Hospitality units generally have their own stand by arrangement for water supply in the form of bore wells. Bore wells are to be dug with the permission of local civic authorities and they charge yearly rent for bore well. Since the bore well provides hard water the hotel has to invest in a water treatment plant. The water is supplied to the various locations in the hotel by means of a large network of pipes, pipe fittings, valves etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Water Distributions\n</b><br>\n<br><b>A. Cold Water Distribution System in a Hotel\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>1. Raising Main</i></b> – It is a supply pipe line that rises from ground level to the storage tank on the roof top. Since the supply pressure is not enough, there are intermediate booster pumps to enable the water to reach the top storage tanks. Some times intermediate storage and multiple tanks are used for serving a group of intermediate floors. The water is stored in the storage tank through the raising main, the storage tank is located at the highest point in the building to ensure a reasonable pressure in the distribution pipes .\n<br><b><i>2. Discharge or Service Piping</i></b> – Water for drinking, kitchen and wash basins etc. is directly taken from the rising main by branch pipe at different floors and flows into the service taps. The stop valves should be fitted immediately after the exit from the tanks for disconnecting the pipeline distribution system in case of leakage in tank or pipe system.\n<br><b><i>3. Valves</i></b> – are generally gate valves used to completely open or close the water lines .\n<br><b><i>4. Storage Tank </i></b>:\n<br>A. Float Valve / Ball Valve – is a spherical rubber ball at the inlet pipe (at the top of the tank), drops down and opens the inlet when the water level falls and rises as the water level rises and finally closes the inlet when the tank is full. An alarm generally gives the signal that the tank is full.\n<br>B. Silencer pipe – This is fitted at the end of the inlet pipe to lower the point of discharge a little above the bottom of the tank. It reduces the water filling noise in the tank.\n<br>C. Overflow Pipe – It works when the float valve is out of water.\n<br>D. Lid – Covers the tank.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. Hot Water Distribution System in a Hotel\n</b><br>Cold water raised to a temperature of 38C is usually considered as hot. The operating temperature range is 49 to 60 degree Celsius. In hotels the most prevalent system for hot water are:\n<br>\n<br>1. Centralized hot water generation and distribution system.\n<br>2. Localized hot water generation and distribution system.\n<br>\n<br><b>Centralised Hot Water System:\n</b><br>This system is usually employed in large hotels. Three different principles used to generate hot water are:\n<br>* Direct Heating System\n<br>* Indirect Heating System\n<br>* Solar Water Heating System\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Direct Heating System\n</b><br>• This system involves natural circulation .\n<br>• Hot water from the boiler circulates through a hot water tank called cylinder.\n<br>• Circulation continues because hot water being lighter rises up to the cylinder from the boiler and cold water descends down to the boiler.\n<br>• The service pipes are taken from the cylinder to service taps.\n<br>• A cold water system is connected to the boiler from where cold water runs into the boiler via stop valves.\n<br>• Whenever there is increase in volume of water and cylinder is unable to accommodate this, the resulting pressure would lead o the possible busting of pipes.\n<br>• To avoid this possible bursting, the water is supplied to an overhead cistern.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages:\n</b><br>• Oxygen released while heating cold water causes rusting of boiler.\n<br>• Boiling can lead to sever scale formation\n<br>\n<br><b>Indirect Water Heating\n</b><br>In this system the water cylinder is replaced by a direct heat exchanger called the calorifier where hot water or steam from the boiler enters the calorifier through a coil of tubes and heats the cold water passing through the calorifier.\n<br>\n<br>Two circulations are followed.\n<br>• Primary Circulation – takes place between the boiler and the calorifier\n<br>• Secondary Circulation – takes place between the calorifier and service taps.\n<br>\n<br><b>Solar Water Heating System\n</b><br>Is the most efficient and eco friendly water heating system. Each evacuated tube is similar to a thermos in principle. A glass or metal tube containing the water or heat transfer fluid is surrounded by a larger glass tube. The space between them is a vacuum, so very little heat is lost from the fluid.\n<br>These collectors can even work well in overcast conditions and operate in temperatures as low as -40°F. Individual tubes are replaced as needed.\n<br>A solar thermal collector collects heat by absorbing sunlight. A collector is a device for capturing solar radiation.\n<br>The quantity of solar energy striking the Earth's surface (solar constant) averages about 1,000 watts per square meter under clear skies, depending upon weather conditions, location and orientation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Localized Hot Water System:\n</b><br>\n<br>Storage Tank Water Heater (Geyser):\n<br>• A thermostat controls the temperature of water and it can be heated at any desired temperature.\n<br>• There are two light bulbs provided in the geyser. The red bulb indicates the water is being heated and the green bulb indicates that water is heated up to the desired temperature.\n<br>• Automatic heating begins if the temperature of the heated water falls below the set level.\n<br>• Geysers are used when the duration of hot water supply is limited.\n<br>• May require maintenance if hard water is being used.\n<br>\n<br><b>Thankless Water Heaters:\n</b><br>• When the hot water tap is turned on, water enters the heater.\n<br>• The flow sensor detects the water flow.\n<br>• The burner is automatically ignited.\n<br>• Water circulates through the heat exchanger.\n<br>• The heat exchanger heats the water up to the designated temperature.\n<br>• When the tap is turned off, the unit shuts down.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Simple boiling removes this hardness.\n<br>* Permanent or non-carbonic hardness: it is due to the presence of chlorides and sulphates of both calcium and magnesium. Simple boiling cannot remove his hardness. Use of chemicals and ion exchange methods are used to remove the permanent hardness.\n<br>\n<br><b>Effects of Hard Water\n</b><br>\n<br>It produces less lather with soap, resulting in more soap consumption.\n<br>It produces soap cum, which produces a dirty feeling during and after bath and wash.\n<br>It causes scale formation inside the water boilers and boiling utensils and thus results in corrosion and reduces the heat transfer efficiency.\n<br>It causes turbidity during boiling of water.\n<br>It affects the taste and structure of cooked food.\n<br>Too much intake of hard water affects the digestive process in human beings. It also leads to other heath issues.\n<br>It dis colors fabric.&nbsp;<br><br><b>TEMPORARY HARDNESS</b><br><b><br></b><br><b>Method of Removing Temporary Hardness or Carbonate Hardness</b>\n<br>The temporary hardness of water can be removed either by boiling or by adding lime to the water. This is called temporary hardness because the hardness is removed simply by boiling it. We now discuss both the methods.\n<br>\n<br><b>Boiling :\n</b><br>Rain water when falling absorbs carbon dioxide (C02) in air. Calcium carbonate inside the earth, being only slightly soluble, will usually exist in water as calcium bicarbonate because it easily dissolves in the water containing C02. When such water is boiled, the C02 gas will get out, while insoluble CaC03 comes out of water as a thick white precipitate, which can be sediment out in the settling tank.\n<br>\n<br>The down arrow sign (↓) by the side of a chemical product denotes that it is insoluble in the solution and would form a precipitate and can be removed from the solution (water in this case) by filtering or decantation process. The up arrow sign ( ↑) by the side of a chemical product denotes that it is a gas and goes out of the system as a product of the chemical reaction.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO3)2 + Heat -----------&gt; CaCO3 ↓+ CO2 ↑+ H2O\n<br>Mg(HCO3)2 + Heat -----------&gt; MgCO3 ↓+ CO2 ↑+ H2O\n<br>\n<br>Calcium and magnesium carbonates arc insoluble in water, and hence accumulate as thick while precipitate at the bottom and can be removed in the sedimentation tank. The carbon dioxide formed is liberated as gas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Addition of lime (also called Clarke's process)\n</b><br>The calculated amount of lime (CaO) or, more generally, hydrated lime is added to the water. The reaction takes place between magnesium bicarbonate and hydrated lime, between calcium bicarbonate and hydrated lime. The calcium carbonates and magnesium can be removed in the sedimentation tank. The reactions that take place are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Ca (HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 -----------&gt; 2CaCO3 ↓+2H2o\n<br>Mg(HCO3)2 +2Ca(OH)2 -----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ 2 CaCO3 ↓+2H2O\n<br><br><br><br><b>PERMANENT HARDNESS</b><br><br><br><b>Method of Removing Permanent Hardness or non-Carbonate Hardness\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Washing soda process\n</b><br>The chemical formula of washing soda is Na2C03. The reactions that take place on adding washing soda solution to hard water are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Na2CO3 +CaSO4 -----------&gt; CaCO3 🡫+ Na2SO4\n<br>Na2CO3 + MgCI2 -----------&gt; MgCO3 🡫 + 2NaCI\n<br>\n<br><b>Caustic soda process\n</b><br>Caustic soda can be used to remove both carbonate (temporary) and non-carbonate (permanent) hardness. Calcium and magnesium hydrogen carbonates react with caustic soda to produce insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide.\n<br>\n<br>2NaOH + MgSO4-----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ Na2SO4\n<br>2NaOH+ CaCl2 -----------&gt; Ca(OH)2 ↓+ 2NaCl\n<br>2NaOH + Mg(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ↓+ 2Na2CO3+2H20\n<br>2NaOH+Ca(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; CaCO3 ↓+ 2Na2CO3 + H2o\n<br>\n<br>From the above reactions, we find that this process not only removes permanent hardness but also temporary hardness. This process is very efficient for low alkalinity water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Ion exchange by resin or demineralization process for removing hardness\n</b><br>\n<br>There are many pieces of equipment in industry, such as water boiler and other process equipment and scientific apparatus, which would need water free of any minerals. The process by which the minerals are removed is known as demineralization (DM) and the plant is known as DM plant. Since this process helps us in completely removing or reducing the mineral content to any desired extent, it is very suitable for producing water of any desired hardness or even mineral free water. The demineralized water is sometimes called deionized water and is as pure as distilled water.\n<br>The process consists of passing the water through cation exchange resins, which produce almost similar effects as are produced in the zeolite method, except that hydrogen (instead of sodium) is exchanged for the basic metallic ions. The cation exchange resins in fact are phenol aldehyde condensation products.\n<br>Their chemical formula may be represented by H2R, which represents the hydrogen ion and R represents the organic part of the substance.\n<br>\n<br>Ca(HCO3)2 + H2R -----------&gt; CaR +2H2O+2CO2\n<br>Na2CO3+H2R -----------&gt; Na2R + H2O + CO2\n<br>\n<br>Thus, we find that these cation exchange resins exchange sodium ions also, which come out of the water forming exchanged resin (Na2R), making water free from minerals. However, absolutely pure water can be very corrosive if it comes in contact with air, thus absorbing oxygen from it as this water has a strong affinity for oxygen.\n<br>\n<br><b>Calgon softener\n</b><br>Calgon is the trade name of a complex salt, sodium hexametaphosphate (NaP03)6. It is used for softening hard water. Calgon ionizes to give a complex anion, which subsequently combines with Ca and Mg ions in hard water.\n<br>\n<br>(NaPO3)6 or Na2 (Na4P6O18). 2Na + Na4P6O2(18)\n<br>\n<br>The addition of Calgon to hard water causes the calcium and magnesium ions of hard water to displace sodium ions from the anion of Calgon according to the following reaction:\n<br>\n<br>Caso4 +Na2 (Na4P6O18) -----------&gt; Na2SO4 + Ca (Na4P6O18)\n<br>\n<br>This results in the removal of calcium and magnesium ions from hard water in the form of a complex compound with Calgon. The water is, thus, softened. Sodium salts are released into water without causing any hardness. It is being dosed into water used for washing machine, dyeing work, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Zeolite (or permutit) or base exchange or cation exchange process\n</b><br>Hardness can be very effectively and economically removed by using a chemical called zeolite. Zeolite (a green salt generally termed as green sand) is a naturally available salt (Na2O, AI2O3, 4SiO2, 2H2O) which reacts with salts in hard water and forms insoluble salts of Ca and Mg. This is also manufactured synthetically and the white coloured salt is sold under the name of 'Permutit' which is, chemically, hydrated sodium aluminium orthosilicate, having the formula Na2[(AIO2)2(SiO2)2]. xH20 .\n<br>\n<br>Permutit is manufactured from naturally available feldspar, kaoline clay, and soda. In chemical equations, we use the short form of the chemical as sodium zeolite (Na2Z) where Z represents [(A102)2 (Si02)2].\n<br>Hence, the process of removing hardness by using this chemical is known as zeolite process as well as 'permutit process'. Any salt has a positively charged part (or cations) and negatively charged part (or anions). Usually, the metallic part of the salt is cation (also called base). For example, in calcium carbonate, calcium is the base or cation and carbonate is the anion. These zeolites have the excellent property of exchanging their cations (sodium) with those (calcium and magnesium) in hard water, which enables them to perform the softening operation. The sodium ions of the zeolite get replaced by the calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water, forming insoluble calcium zeolite and magnesium zeolite.\n<br>\n<br>Softening reaction\n<br>Na2Z +. Ca or Mg Salt --------------&gt; Na2 Salt + Ca or Mg zeolite\n<br>\n<br>After a few days of operation, all the active sodium zeolite should change to used calcium and magnesium zeolite. However, calcium and magnesium zeolite can be converted back into active sodium zeolite by reacting it with 10 per cent solution of sodium chloride (common table salt solution).\n<br>This process is known as regeneration. The exchange reaction that takes place during regeneration can be represented as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Regeneration Reaction\n<br>CaZ/MgZ. +2NaCI --------------&gt; Na2Z + CaCI2/MgCI2\n<br>\n<br><b>Working of a zeolite softening plant\n</b><br>A zeolite softener (or a cation exchange unit) resembles a sand filter in which the filtering medium is a zeolite rather than sand, as shown in image. The hard water enters through the top as shown in the figure and is evenly distributed on the entire zeolite bed. As the hard water passes through the bed, reactions as given above take place and the softened water is collected through the strainers at the base. The zeolite bed is increasingly depleted in its active sodium zeolite content with increasing proportion of Ca and Mg zeolite, When a significant portion of the sodium in the zeolite has been replaced by calcium and magnesium, softening process is stopped by stopping flow of hard water and regeneration operation is started first by washing the bed with good soft water and then passing per cent solution of brine through the bed. The excess brine solution retained in the zeolite, as well as the soluble Ca and Mg chloride salts removed from the activated zeolite bed, after the treatment, are removed by again washing them with good soft water.\n<br>The regenerated zeolite is now ready and can be used afresh for softening.\n<br>The rate of filtration through a zeolite softener is about 300 liters per square meter per minute.\n<br>\n<br><b>Advantages of zeolite process\n</b><br>The advantages of zeolite process are as follows:\n<br>• Zero hardness can be obtained and have specific uses in textile industries boilers, etc.\n<br>• The plants are compact, automatic, and easy to operate.\n<br>• The Running, Maintenance, and Operation (RMO) cost is quite less.\n<br>• It also removes iron and manganese from water.\n<br>• There is no problem in treating water of varying quality<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

But acc. to the norms of the PCB (Pollution Control Board) , sewage needs to be properly treated before it is disposed.  \n<br>\n<br><b>SEWAGE TREATMENT:\n</b><br>It is the process of removing the contaminants from sewage to convert it to a composition of clear liquid and solid, which are fit for discharge to the environment or for reuse.\n<br> \n<br><b>SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT\n</b><br>• In the most sophisticated treatment, clear potable water can be obtained while leaving only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of solids after treatment.\n<br>• This solid part, called sludge, is further processed to produce what is called bio solid, which have many uses.\n<br>• While hoteliers can discharge their sewage to the public sewerage, along with town sewage, for treatment in the city sewage treatment plant and final disposal.\n<br>• Many hotels have opted for in-house, Sewage Treatment Plants, where they get fresh water for reuse and may use the sludge as manure for garden activities.\n<br>• The fundamental principal of purifying sewage is to completely break down the original organic matter in it by the action of microorganisms (bacteria). These microorganisms digest (eat away) the original organic matter leaving a clear effluent and solids.\n<br>\n<br><b>The stages in treatment of sewage are as follows:\n</b><br>1. Primary Treatment: This removes the suspended and floating objects by means of strainer, screens, grit chamber, sedimentation tanks, septic tanks, etc. The typical materials that are removed in this stage include large objects such as sticks, rugs, rocks, sand, gravel, fats, oils, grease etc.\n<br>2. Secondary Treatment: This treatment is designed to degrade the biological and organic content of the sewage by means of microbial action. The bacteria present in the sewage consume all the organic matter.\n<br>3. Tertiary process with or without disinfectant: The final treatment is performed at this stage before making eventual disposal of the treated wastewater. Tertiary treatment comprises of many processes and includes filtration, disinfection and removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which encourage algae formation. Disinfection can be done with chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet treatment. In many cases, disinfection is done as the last activity (also called effluent polishing). The purpose of disinfection is to destroy residual bacteria in water after secondary treatment, thus rendering it very safe for final disposal.\n<br>\n<br><b>Methods of Sewage Disposal\n</b><br>Sewage disposal is broadly classified into the following types:&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A part evaporates, while a part percolate. Purification is accomplished by natural oxidation. This is a very good method of sewage disposal where land is available. Bright sunshine helps in microbial activities in the sewage. Decomposed sewage becomes an excellent manure for crops. However, if harmful bacteria percolate through ground subsoil reaching the ground water, it could contaminate ground water.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical Treatment:</b> Effected by addition of chemicals such as lime, alum etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Septic Tank</b> – Used to provide disposal of sewage in a plain sedimentation tank where biochemical reactions (decomposition) also takes place. After decomposition sewage is purified and effluent is taken to soak pits for disposal to city sewers. The solid portion remains in the septic tank due to which the septic tank should be cleaned after a period of 2 to 5 years.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bio-aeration</b> – The sewage is first passed through coarse screens to get rid of large solids. The sewage is then treated in the main aeration tank with compressed air.\n<br>\n<br><b>GREEN HOTELS</b>\n<br>Green hotels are environmentally friendly properties that take the initiative and implement very important practices and programs to reduce energy, water, and waste.Green Hotels are participating in recycling programs, linen changing programs, installing energy efficient lighting, and getting their message out to their guests and how they are doing their part in protecting the planet.  \n<br>\n<br><b>Ways to control pollution in hotels\n<br></b>\n<br><b>1. Install Energy Saving Technologies\n</b><br>It has been estimated that 75% of hotels' environmental impacts can be directly related to excessive consumption—including energy consumption. Installing energy-efficient technologies such as appliances, lighting, and heating and cooling systems can make a difference for both the environment and your hotel's bottom line.\n<br><b>2. Embrace Recycling\n</b><br>Another huge impact the hospitality industry has on the environment is due to the amount of waste hotels create. It's time to embrace recycling, and we're not just talking about using cloth napkins instead of paper.\n<br>According to the Green Hotels Association, a hotel in Toronto is recycling stained tablecloths into napkins, chef's aprons, and neckties, while other hotels are making cloth laundry bags from retired sheets. These are the sort of initiatives that can make a long-term difference when put into practice.\n<br><b>3. Encourage Guests to be Green\n</b><br>Put cards in each room asking guests to turn out the lights when they leave, or reuse towels if possible. Make recycling bins readily available to guests and be sure that they are aware of your green programs. When guests see that your hotel is making an effort to help the environment, they will want to do their part as well.\n<br>For those hotels looking to do even more, consider loaning or renting bicycles to guests, or look into installing a bike-sharing station.\n<br><b>4. Start Composting\n</b><br>An increasing number of hotels are realizing the benefits of composting food waste rather than throwing it out. Not only is it a popular and well-known green initiative that will impress your guests, it can save your hotel money on landscaping since composted waste can be used as organic fertilizer.\n<br><b>5. Save Water\n</b><br>There are so many ways hotels can save water: Installing toilet tank fill divert in older toilets can save about 3/4 of a gallon of water per flush. Transitioning to nearly water less laundry machines can save 80% of hotel water usage. Making water stations available to guests can discourage the use of bottled water. Follow the examples from other hotels that have implemented water-saving initiatives.\n<br><b>6. Plant a Garden\n</b><br>If you're considering expanding your outdoor offerings for guests, consider adding a garden rather than simply extending your patio or pool area. The Green Hotels Association notes that one Pennsylvania property has a 400-foot garden and produces organically-grown vegetables for its restaurant.\n<br>Now you don't have to go that far, but even a small garden (perhaps even on the rooftop for those of you with city properties) can help counteract your hotel's carbon footprint. Raised beds can be installed almost anywhere, and placing benches—made from recycled materials—around a garden can make for a wonderful guest experience.\n<br><b>7. Support Local, Sustainable Businesses\n</b><br>Hotels can help reduce their environmental impact by making smart purchasing choices as well. A hotel can reduce waste generation by making an effort to only purchase environmentally-friendly products, and purchasing locally can also reduce the impact on the environment and benefit the community.\n<br>You may also want to consider promoting other environmentally-friendly businesses to guests, such as local farm-to-table restaurants.\n<br><b>8. Implement Alternative Energy Sources\n</b><br>A number of hotels have switched at least portions of their energy usage to alternative sources, with great results.\n<br><b>9. Take Care of Your Linens\n</b><br>We already mentioned recycling linens as a way to limit waste, but what about extending the life of those linens in the first place? Using laundry processes that limit the wear and tear on your linens can keep replacement costs, and your hotel's environmental impact, down.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In practice, conservation is the act of protecting, managing, and restoring shared earth resources such as soil, air, forests, minerals, petroleum, wildlife, and water one of humans' most essential resources.\n<br>Conservation generally involves managing natural resources to serve people, whether by providing materials for essential needs (water, food, shelter, and energy) and consumer products (cars, clothing, computers, furniture), or simply by protecting wild areas where people can enjoy nature and outdoor recreation. While most scientists do not argue with using Earth's natural resources to meet human needs, most scientists also agree with the general idea that shared natural resources should be protected from overuse and pollution, and wisely managed using sound scientific information.\n<br>\n<br><b>Need For Water Conservation\n</b><br>Water is Earth's most plentiful natural resource. It covers almost three-quarters of our planet's surface. Astronauts say Earth looks like a \"blue marble\" from space with its blue oceans and white swirls of water droplets (clouds) in the atmosphere (mass of air surrounding Earth). Water is also a renewable resource. Water moves endlessly within the hydro-logic cycle, and is almost never destroyed in the process. When humans draw water from lakes, rivers, oceans, or groundwater reservoirs (aquifers), new water replaces it. Water is even self-cleansing. When it evaporates, it leaves pollution and salts behind and forms clouds that produce fresh rainwater. New water that flows into polluted lakes and rivers acts to dilute (lower the concentration or amount) and disperse (spread out) pollutants.\n<br>• Ninety-seven % of all water on the earth is salt water, which is not suitable for drinking.\n<br>• Only 3% of water on Earth is fresh water, and only 0.5% is available for drinking.\n<br>• The other 2.5% of fresh water is locked in ice caps, glaciers, the atmosphere, soil, or under the earth's surface, or is too polluted for consumption.\n<br>With growing population rates and such a small percentage of all the water on Earth fit for consumption, it only makes sense that we must preserve and conserve this precious resource.\n<br>Did you know that nearly 1 billion people, mostly in the developing world, have no access to safe water? More than double this number - about 2.4 billion - has no access to any form of improved sanitation facilities. They could use your help to get it.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reasons to Conserve Water\n</b><br>Below are some of the main reasons it is important to conserve water.\n<br>• It minimizes the effects of drought and water shortages. Even though our need for fresh water sources is always increasing because of population and industry growth, the supply we have stays constant. Even though water eventually returns to Earth through the water cycle, it's not always returned to the same spot, or in the same quantity and quality. By reducing the amount of water we use, we can better protect against future drought years.\n<br>• It guards against rising costs and political conflict. Failing to conserve water can eventually lead to a lack of an adequate water supply, which can have drastic consequences. These include rising costs, reduced food supplies, health hazards, and political conflict.\n<br>• It helps to preserve our environment. Reducing our water usages reduces the energy required to process and deliver it to homes, businesses, farms, and communities, which, in turn, helps to reduce pollution and conserve fuel resources.\n<br>• It makes water available for recreational purposes. It's not just swimming pools, spas, and golf courses that we have to think about. Much of our freshwater resources are also used for beautifying our surroundings—watering lawns, trees, flowers, and vegetable gardens, as well as washing cars and filling public fountains at parks. Failing to conserve water now can mean losing out on such uses later on.\n<br>• It builds safe and beautiful communities: Fire-fighters, hospitals, gas stations, street cleaners, health clubs, gyms, and restaurants all require large amounts of water to provide services to the community. Reducing our usage of water now means that these services can continue to be provided.\n<br>\n<br><b>Water Conservation in Hotel\n</b><br>The first thing to do if you want to understand how to lower your water bill is to conduct something called a water audit. A water audit is a process to figure out how much water your business is using and exactly where it’s all going. Though the best way to get accurate results is to hire an energy consulting firm, this can be done in a more general way by yourself and/or your staff. If you choose to conduct your own water audit, you should start by looking at two things: your previous water bills and your water meter(s).\n<br>Understand the Flow\n<br>Once you have an idea of your usage rates you want to dig deeper to find out where that lump sum of water is actually flowing. From there, you can move on to deciding how to conserve water. To do that, you need usage information from each and every fixture and appliance in your hotel that uses water. Here’s list to get you started:\n<br>• Sinks\n<br>• Faucets\n<br>• Showers\n<br>• Toilets\n<br>• Dishwashers\n<br>• Washing Machines\n<br>• Ice Machines\n<br>• Cooling Towers (part of your HVAC System)\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Restrooms\n</b><br>• Low flow and high efficiency toilets will save you money immediately. REMEMBER: Dual-flush toilets should be equipped with posted instructions so that everyone understands how to use them!\n<br>• Have sink aerators installed; these reduce the flow of water by 1.5 gallons/minute.\n<br>• Install shower heads that regulate flow; 2.5 gallons/minute or less will not bother your guests, while saving you big time.\n<br>• Install motion activated sensors for hotel sinks and restroom facilities. This not only controls the amount of time water is used, but your guests will appreciate hands-free options.\n<br>• Install timers in your hotel showers. This is a gentle reminder to guests to be conscious of water conservation.\n<br>• Many urinals are no-flush, but there are new energy efficient models on the market which may provide a more pleasant user experience.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Kitchen\n</b><br>• Upgrade to ENERGY STAR® rated equipment. This alone will reduce water usage by approximately 10%.\n<br>• Install sink aerators to reduce the flow of water to 2.5 gallons/minute or less.\n<br>• Install pedal operated faucets. This will reduce the ability for staff to turn on a faucet and walk away while leaving it running.\n<br>• Turn off continuous flow water streams when not in immediate use.\n<br>• Pre-soak dishes.\n<br>• Only run fully loaded dish racks through the washer.\n<br>• Defrost food in refrigerators instead of under running water. With just a bit of foresight, you will save thousands of gallons/year by eliminating this unnecessary cost.\n<br>• Wash vegetables in water basins rather than under running water.\n<br>• Fix leaky water lines immediately.\n<br>• Educate your staff about water usage and encourage them to be conscious of how they use water.\n<br>• Install food traps or compost food waste, rather than automatically and excessively using your garbage disposal which requires running water to work properly.\n<br>\n<br><b> Hotel Landscaping\n</b><br>• Water your hotel landscape 2 to 3 times a week instead of every day.\n<br>• Remove weeds and other unwanted plants to preserve water for your desired landscape.\n<br>• Do not over-fertilize or over-prune plants to avoid overstimulated growth.\n<br>• Avoid hosing down hotel sidewalks, parking lots and driveways, unless absolutely necessary.\n<br>• Install soil moisture override systems and timers on hotel sprinkler systems.\n<br>• Time watering when evaporation is the lowest: early morning or evenings are the key.\n<br>• Make sure irrigation equipment applies water evenly; if it’s watering anything other than the lawn and garden, it’s wasting your money.\n<br>• Use mulch around plants to help avoid evaporation and keep weeds to a minimum.\n<br>• Install drip irrigation instead of sprinkler systems.\n<br>• Install rain sensors on your sprinkler system so you don’t end up watering in the rain!\n<br>• Install rain barrels or other water catchment systems to catch water as it falls from the sky for free for later use in landscape watering.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>A Few More …..\n</i></b><br>• Sweep floors whenever possible to clean them. Avoid washing down sidewalks and surfaces with hoses, which waste a lot of water in this application.\n<br>• Consider switching your mopping system to the water broom, a new technology that saves water while delivering maximum cleaning power.\n<br>• Conduct an audit of your housecleaning staff and their procedures and keep an eye out for excessive water usage during cleaning.\n<br>• Discourage water-wasting practices in the housekeeping staff, like using the bathtub as a mopping station.\n<br>• Switch your hotel’s carpet cleaning process from wet to dry.\n<br>• Have windows cleaned on an as-needed basis, as opposed to a set schedule which may be unnecessary.\n<br>• Consider switching any water cooled equipment to air cooled – in addition to your ice machines this could include air compressors and refer condensers.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Voltage\" (V) is the potential for energy to move and is analogous to water pressure.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a amp?\n</b><br>An \"amp\", short for ampere, is a unit of electrical current which is defines in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. \"Amperage\" is the strength of a current of electricity expressed in amperes.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is an ohm?\n</b><br>\"Ohm\" is a unit of an electric circuit that is defined as the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is a watt?\n</b><br>A \"watt\" is a measure of power. One watt (W) is the rate at which work is done when one ampere (A) of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt (V).\n<br>\n<br>Simple way to understand……\n<br>Watts = Amps x Volts\n<br>Volt = Watts / Amps\n<br>Amps = Watts / Volts\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Fuses and Circuit Breakers\n</b><br>Fuses and Circuit Breakers both serve the same purpose – which is to protect electrical circuits by preventing overloads that can cause fires. They both interrupt the flow of electricity, but in very different ways from each other.\n<br><br>Fuse is made of a piece of metal that melts when overheated.\n<br>● Cartridge Fuse \n<br>● Plug Fuse\n<br>\n<br><b>Fuses</b>\n<br>Fuses come in different types – for both residential and commercial use. The most common type is made from a metal wire or a filament that is enclosed in a glass or ceramic and metal casing. In residential homes, the fuse is usually plugged into a central fuse box, where the building’s wiring passes through. When electricity flows, the fuse will permit the power to pass unobstructed across the filament between circuits. If overloads occur, the filament melts and stops the flow of electricity.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In both instances, when turned on, the breaker allows electrical current to pass from a bottom to an upper terminal across the strip. Once the current reaches any unsafe levels, the magnetic force of the strip becomes strong enough to throw a metal lever in the switch mechanism, breaking the current. The other option that can happen is that the metal strip can bend, throwing the switch and breaking the connection. \n<br>\n<br><b>Circuit breaker components\n</b><br>The five universal circuit breaker components are: \n<br>\n<br>● Frame – Protects internal parts of the circuit breaker from outside materials \n<br>● Operating mechanism – Provides a means of opening and closing the circuit breaker \n<br>● Contacts – Allows the current to flow through the circuit breaker when closed. \n<br>● Arc extinguisher – Extinguishes an arc when the circuit breaker interrupts a fault. \n<br>● Trip unit – Opens the operating mechanism in the event of a prolonged overload or short circuit.\n<br>\n<br><b>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage \n</b><br>* Fuse is a less expensive device to protect from over current. It reacts quicker than the circuit breakers, and it as a hope that it won’t cause more failure than the breakers because of it as less moving parts. Whereas in circuit breakers if the inner working parts have some faulty, the damage to the electrical appliances will be more because they react slower than the fuse. \n<br>* One must be careful when replacing the fuse. If you install a 30amp fuse on a 20amp circuit, it ultimately leads to cause an electric fire. \n<br>* Keep on replacing melted fuses can become more expensive but, in circuit breakers, you need to flip the switch. \n<br>* Installation of a circuit breaker is complicated and expensive and also the maintenance cost is high but in a long-term, it saves a lot of money. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>The Difference Between Fuse and Circuit Breaker \n</b><br>* Fuse works on the principle of electrical and thermal properties of the conducting materials whereas the Circuit breaker works on the Electromagnetism and switching principle. \n<br>* Fuses once used cannot be reused again, but the Circuit breaker can be reused. Hence, there is no need to change the circuit breaker after any fault takes place and the coil is tripped. \n<br>* Fuse cannot be used as an ON/OFF switch whereas Circuit Breaker can be used as an ON/OFF switch. \n<br>* Fuses are independent of ambient temperature, but Circuit Breaker not require any ambient temperature. \n<br>* The Fuse provides protection against only power overloads whereas Circuit Breaker provides protection for both power overloads and short circuits. \n<br>* Breaking capacity of the fuse is low as compared to that of a Circuit Breaker. \n<br>* Operating time of fuse is very less about 0.002 second, whereas Operating time of a Circuit Breaker is comparatively more than that of the fuse. It is about 0.02 – 0.05 second. \n<br>* Mode of operation of Fuse is completely automatic, but Circuit Breakers can be operated manually as well as automatically with the help of a relay system. \n<br>* The cost of the fuse is low, whereas Circuit Breakers are more costly. \n<br>\n<br><b>Voltage drop \n</b><br>A voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when a current passes through the cable. It is related to the resistance or impedance to current flow with passive elements in the circuits including cables, contacts and connectors affecting the level of voltage drop. The longer the circuit or length of cable the greater the voltage loss. The impact of a voltage drop can cause problems such as motors running slowly, heaters not heating to full potential, lights being dimmed. To compensate for voltage drop larger cross-sectional sized cables may be used which offer less resistance / impedance to current flow. \n<br>\n<br>V=IR \n<br>Ohms Law: V = I R \n<br>*Ohm’s Law (I = V/R) says: \n<br>* The current (I) through a wire or electrical resistor is \n<br>* proportional to the potential difference V across the two ends, and \n<br>* inversely proportional to its resistance R. \n<br>* Resistance (R) depends on Surface \n<br><b><br>Single- phase &amp; three- phase electric power \n</b><br>* single-phase electric power is the distribution of alternating current electric power using a system in which all the voltages of the supply vary in unison. Single-phase distribution is used when loads are mostly lighting and heating, with few large electric motors. A single-phase supply connected to an alternating current electric motor does not produce a rotating magnetic field; single-phase motors need additional circuits for starting (capacitor start motor), and such motors are uncommon above 10 kW in rating. \n<br>\n<br>* Three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying alternating current voltages that are offset in time by one-third of the period. A wye system allows the use of two different voltages from all three phases, such as a 230/400 V system which provides 230 V between the neutral (centre hub) and any one of the phases, and 400 V across any two phases. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Three Phase Supply Benefits \n</b><br>* Copper Utilization Reduction \n<br>* Lessening of Security Risks for Employees \n<br>* Labour Treatment Costs \n<br>* The efficiency of the Conductor is Greater \n<br>* Facility to Run High Power Loads \n<br>\n<br><b>Single Phase Supply Benefits \n</b><br>* The benefits of choosing a single phase supply include the following. \n<br>* The design is less complex \n<br>* Design cost is less \n<br>* Most efficient AC power supply for up to 1000 watts \n<br>* Single Phase AC Power Supply is most competent for up to 1000 watts. \n<br>* Wide-range of application uses \n<br>\n<br><b>Key Differences between Single Phase and Three Phase Supplies \n</b><br>* The definition of the single-phase power supply is, the power supplies through a single conductor \n<br>* The definition of the three-phase power supply is, the power flows through three conductors. \n<br>* The single-phase power supply has one distinct wave cycle whereas; three phase has three distinct wave cycles. \n<br>* Single phase requires the single wire to connect the circuit whereas; 3-phase needs 3-wires. \n<br>* The voltage of the single phase is 230V, whereas three phase voltage is 415V. \n<br>* The phase name of the single phase is split phase, whereas three phase has no other name. \n<br>* The capacity of power transfer in the single phase is minimum, whereas three phase has the maximum. \n<br>* The connection of single phase is simple whereas in 3-phase is complicated. \n<br>* The power failure happens in a single phase, but not occurs in three phase. \n<br>* The loss in single phase is maximum whereas in three phase is minimum. \n<br>* The single-phase efficiency is less whereas in three phase is high. \n<br>* The single-phase is inexpensive whereas the 3-phase is expensive. \n<br>* The single-phase AC power supply is utilized for home appliances and three phase power supply is used in huge industries to run heavy loads. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>AC &amp; DC System \n</b><br>There are two systems of electric generation and supply, \n<br>1. Direct current or DC. \n<br>2. Alternating current or AC. \n<br>\n<br>● Direct Current: it is the kind of electric current that may or may not change the magnitude but the direction of the current will never change. E.g. Cells, Batteries and DC Generator. \n<br>\n<br>● Alternating Current: it is the kind of electric current, which not only changes its magnitude but also its sign as time passes, in a definite manner. This is the current that is supplied by Power station for domestic and commercial use. \n<br>\n<br><b>Kilowatt hour \n</b><br>One kilowatt-hour is equal to the work done or energy consumed when a device of power 1 kW is used for 1 hour. The hour is a unit of time listed among the non-SI units accepted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for use with the SI. Its combination with the kilowatt, a standard SI unit, is therefore permitted within the standard.\n<br>\n<br><b>Electricity sales \n</b><br>Electrical energy is typically sold to consumers in kilowatt-hours. The cost of running an electrical device is calculated by multiplying the device's power consumption in kilowatts by the operating time in hours, and by the price per kilowatt-hour. The unit price of electricity charged by utility companies may depend on the customer's consumption profile over time. Prices vary considerably by locality. In the United States prices in different states can vary by a factor of three.\n<br>\n<br>While smaller customer loads are usually billed only for energy, transmission services, and the rated capacity, larger consumers also pay for peak power consumption, the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes. This compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power. These charges are billed as demand changes. Industrial users may also have extra charges according to the power factor of their load. \n<br>\n<br>Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours (TWh) for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year. A 365-day year equals 8,760 hours, so over a period of one year, power of one gigawatt equates to 8.76 terawatt-hours of energy. Conversely, one terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of about 114 megawatts for a period of one year. \n<br>\n<br><i>Examples \n</i><br>An electric heater consuming 1000 watts (1 kilowatt), and operating for one hour uses one kilowatt-hour of energy. A television consuming 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt-hour. A 40-watt electric appliance operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt-hour. In terms of human power, a healthy adult male manual laborer performs work equal to about one half of one kilowatt-hour over an eight-hour day.\n<br>\n<br><b>Electrical Earthing \n</b><br>The process of transferring the immediate discharge of the electrical energy directly to the earth by the help of the low resistance wire is known as the electrical earthing. The electrical earthing is done by connecting the non-current carrying part of the equipment or neutral of the supply system to the ground.\n<br>Mostly, the galvanised iron is used for the earthing. The earthing provides the simple path to the leakage current. The short circuit current of the equipment passes to the earth which has zero potential. Thus, protects the system and equipment from damage.\n<br>\n<b><i><br>Types of Electrical Earthing\n</i></b><br>● Neutral Earthing \n<br>● Equipment Earthing\n<br>\n<b><br>Importance of Earthing \n</b><br>The earthing is essential because of the following reasons \n<br>\n<br>● The earthing protects the personnel from the shortcircuit current. \n<br>● The earthing provides the easiest path to the flow of shortcircuit current even after the failure of the insulation. \n<br>● The earthing protects the apparatus and personnel from the high voltage surges and lightning discharge.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

They have contributed significant progress in all different sectors. By pushing the switch or button, you call a metal box that transports you from one floor to another with safely. In fact, an elevator is mandatory for a building which has more than four to five floors high. For most of the people, an elevator offer ease as well as convenience, and also makes life easier for physically handicapped persons. This article discusses what is the elevator, how does it work and types.\n<br>\n<br><b>What is Elevator (Lift)?\n</b><br>An elevator can be defined as an electric lift which is used as vertical transportation of goods as well as people among the floors in buildings using bins otherwise silos. As usual, these are activated with the electrical motors that also to drive counterweight system cables for drive transaction such as a hoist, otherwise, pump hydraulic fluid for raising a cylindrical piston such as a jack.\n<br>\n<br><b>How Does a Lift work?\n</b><br>The working principle of an elevator or lift is similar to the pulley system. A pulley system is used to draw the water from the well. This pulley system can be designed with a bucket, a rope with a wheel. A bucket is connected to a rope that passes throughout a wheel. This can make it very easy to draw the water from the well. Similarly, present elevators use the same concept. But the main difference between these two are; pulley systems are operated manually whereas an elevator uses sophisticated mechanisms for handling the elevator’s load.\n<br>Basically, an elevator is a metal box in different shapes which is connected to a very tough metal rope. The tough metal rope passes through a sheave on the elevator in the engine room. Here a sheave is like a wheel in pulley system for clutching the metal rope strongly. This system can be operated by a motor. When the switch is turned ON, the motor can be activated when the elevator goes up and down or stops.\n<br>The elevator can be constructed with various elevator Components or elevator parts that mainly include speed controlling system, electric motor, rails, cabin, shaft, doors (manual and automatic), drive unit, buffers, and safety device.\n<br>\n<br><b>Different Types of Elevator\n</b><br>The different types of lifts or elevators include building lift, capsule lift, hydraulic elevator, pneumatic elevator, passenger lift, freight elevator, traction elevator/cable driven, residential elevators, machine room-less elevator, etc.\n<br><br><b>1) Hydraulic Elevator\n</b><br>A hydraulic elevator is power-driven by a piston that moves within a cylinder. The piston movement can be done by pumping hydraulic oil to the cylinder. The piston lifts the lift cab easily, and the oil can be controlled by an electrical valve.\n<br>The applications of hydraulic elevators involve in five to six-floor buildings. The operating of these elevators can be done at speeds up to 200 ft or 61 meters for each minute. All the current hydraulic pumps are designed with a mechanical Y-delta starter otherwise solid state contractor. For the power supply of motor as well as building, solid-state starters are superior. Because the winding stay longer as well as there is no voltage drop across the building power supply.  In Y-delta type starter, the motor can be activated by using two contractors on a decreased speed, after that continues with full speed. Older hydraulic elevators now started up suddenly, transmitting mains power at full-blast right into the electric motor. This sets a lot of damage on the motor, which will make it burn out quicker than motors on Solid-State or Y-Delta Contactor starters. The hydraulic elevators are classified into four types such as holed, hole less &amp; roped elevators \n<br>\n<br><b>2) Pneumatic Elevator\n</b><br>The pneumatic elevator can be designed with an external cylinder, and the cylinder is a crystal clear self-supporting cylinder. This cylinder includes modular sections to fit effortlessly into one by one. The top of this tube is designed with steel material that ensures tight air shutting by suction valves as well as inlets. A lift car runs within the cylinder, &amp; the head unit on the top cylinder surface consists of valves, controllers, and turbines for controlling the elevator movements.\n<br>Pneumatic elevators are very easy to fit, operate as well as maintain when compared with the traditional elevators. These are used in existing homes because of their solid design. The main benefits of using these elevators include solid design &amp; smooth, speed and flexibility, energy efficient and very safe.\n<br>\n<br><b>3) Cable Driven or Traction Elevator\n</b><br>The traction elevator or cable driven elevators are the most popular elevators. It consists of steel cables as well as hoisting ropes that run above a pulley which is connected to the motor. This is geared otherwise gear-less-traction type elevator. In this kind of elevator, several wire and hoisting cables are connected to the surface of an elevator car with covering around it on sheaves at one end &amp; the other side is connected to a counterweight that travels up &amp; down on its guide rails. The counterweight is equivalent to the car’s weight and half of the weight of the passenger in the car. This means, throughout the lifting process it needs extra power for the additional passengers in the car; the rest of the load is managed with the weight of the counter. When the control system is connected to the lift, then it drives the motors in a frontward way, and sheave turns around to move the car lift upwards and stops in the preferred floor where the car is controlled by the weight of the counter. \n<br>For the car downstairs movement, overturn occurs during a rotating motor through a control method. For conserving the energy, some types of lift use electric motors with four quadrant operation in the regenerative method. Because of the high rise as well as high-speed capacities, these are applicable in several escalators, lifts, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>4) Capsule Lift\n</b><br>Capsule lift or Elevators are used in prestigious buildings, which can be called as decoration of a building because they improve the building’s beauty as well as carries life into it.\n<br>The main features of this elevators mainly include design, and travel comfort is best. The interior design of these lifts is attractive with a large glass panel for viewing. The ultramodern design of these lifts offers a cosmic zone travel experience for the passengers. These lifts are consistent and inexpensive with the least maintenance.\n<br>\n<br><b>5) Building Lift\n</b><br>A building lift is a vertical transportation among the floors of the building. These are frequently used in public buildings, complexes, offices, and multistory building. These lifts are important in providing vertical movement, mostly in high buildings, for a wheelchair as well as other non-ambulant building customers. Some type of lifts also is applicable for emigration &amp; firefighting purposes.\n<br>\n<br><b>6) Passenger Lift\n</b><br>This type of lift has entirely included a lift car that moves vertically in a specially equipped lift shaft. Passengers are traveled between the floors in the building at quick speed. The control systems in the lift frequently designed to offer the most economical sharing of passengers all over the building. These lifts are very space efficient which are used in existing buildings where space is at a best.\n<br>The main advantages of using passenger lift give a very comfort traveling among different floors, particularly space efficient, fully fixed shaft, small construction works, and no level loading on the building.\n<br>\n<br><b>7) Freight Elevator</b>\n<br>In the world of elevators, these lifts are workhorses. These are very useful for transporting materials, goods in warehouses, manufacturing industries, shopping malls, seaports, etc. This type of elevator is separated into classes, to describe their load capacity as well as application. These lifts are strong in nature, and they are specially manufactured by engineers.\n<br>The features of this elevator include: the range of loading capacity is from 2500 lbs to 10000 lbs, height of the travel up to 50fts. The benefits of these elevators include; these elevators are designed for commercial as well as industrial applications. The flexible design to hold the application, door designs can be changed, eco-friendly, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>8) Residential Elevators\n</b><br>Residential elevators provide stylish options to the platform as well as stair lifts. These lifts can be effortlessly incorporated in any available home, otherwise incorporated in edifice plans for latest homes. These types of elevators are available in different styles, and these can be installed in your home walls, otherwise included effortlessly to improve your home’s decoration. The main benefits of residential elevators are; they can move you securely among floors even during a power failure. Quick installation and offers you an effortless life.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Escalator Working principle:\n</b><br>\n<br>1. The core parts of the escalator are two chains, which rotate around two pairs of gears. At the top of the escalator, an electric motor drives the transmission gear to rotate the chain ring. A typical escalator USES a 100 horsepower engine to turn the gears. The engine and chain systems are mounted in trusses, which are metal structures that extend from floor to floor.\n<br>2. Unlike the conveyor belt moving a plane, the chain ring moves a set of steps. The most interesting thing about escalators is the way they move. The steps remain level as the chain moves. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the steps fold into a platform. This makes it easier to get up and down the escalator.\n<br>3. Each step of the escalator has two sets of wheels, which rotate along two separate tracks. The top gear (wheels near the top of the steps) is connected to a rotating chain and is pulled by a drive gear located at the top of the escalator. The other wheels simply slide along the track behind the first wheels.\n<br>4. The two tracks are separated from each other, so that each step can be kept level. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the track is in a horizontal position, flattening the steps. There are a series of grooves inside each step to connect the front and rear steps during the leveling process.\n<br>5. Besides rotating the main link, the motor in the escalator can also move the handrails. The armrest is just a rubber conveyor belt that circulates around a series of wheels. The conveyor belt is precisely configured to move at exactly the same speed as the steps, making the rider feel smooth.\n<br>6. The escalator system is not capable of lifting people up dozens of floors as elevators do, but it is suitable for providing short distance transportation. This is because of the high load rate of escalators. When the elevator is full, no one else can get on until it reaches the designated floor and returns. On escalators, as long as one person reaches the top, it makes room for others.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

But an elevator is a room type lift which holds a few people at one time and transports people up and down between levels of building. \n<br>● Elevators are used in multi storied buildings such as offices, apartments, banks, hospitals, etc. But escalators are used in malls, metro and railway stations, etc.\n<br>● Elevators are closed cabins about Escalators are moving stairs. \n<br>● Escalator consists of a motor driven chain on an individual track which cycles on a pair of tracks. An elevator is a type of vertical transportation that moves people or goods between levels of a building. It is powered by an electric motor that attaches a traction cable and counterweight system just like a cylindrical piston.\n<br>● Escalator are power boozers as they have to operate continuously, whereas elevators save electricity. \n<br>● Elevator can carry only 10 to 15 people at one time. But escalators can carry more than 20 people at one time.\n<br>● Escalators are energy guzzlers as they have to operate continuously, whereas elevators consume electricity only when in operation. \n<br>● Patients, luggage, etc can’t travel in escalators but can travel in Elevator.\n<br>● Escalator does not require a specific machine room to control the system of escalators. But elevators require a specific machine room to control the elevator.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Hence appropriate and efficient building transport systems are not only important but necessary also for operation.The systems should be a mix of manual and automatic operations. \n<br>\n<br>There are two types of building transport system namely Vertical Transport System and Horizontal Transport System.\n<br>\n<br><b>A. Vertical Transport System\n</b><br>1. Stairs\n<br>2. Elevators / Lifts\n<br>3. Escalators (Moving Stairs)\n<br>4. Gravity Chutes (for goods)\n<br>5. Dumbwaiter<br>\n<br><b>Stairs\n</b><br>This is the most common and essential for vertical movement of people and goods. It is also mandatory as it is an escape route in case of fire in buildings. In case of power failure, lifts do not operate and hence stair case is the only alternative for vertical movement. It must be fire proof so that guests can safely exit to upper and lower building floors. Provision of hand rails and non-slip steps are recommended for safety purpose.\n<br><br><b>Elevators\n</b><br>An elevator is a transportation device used to transport people and goods vertically. Elevators are generally automatic safety units for up and down transport purpose. It consists of a platform travelling in vertical guides in a shaft with hoisting and lowering mechanism and a source of power. The enclosure moving up and down in the guides is known as car.\n<br>There are two types of lift systems.\n<br>* Cable elevators – They are more common because they are fast, smooth and quite.\n<br>* Hydraulic elevators - are elevators which are powered by a piston that travels inside a cylinder. An electric motor pumps hydraulic oil into the cylinder to move the piston. The piston smoothly lifts the elevator cab/car. They are used when the number of floors to be serviced is less. The elevators require regular inspection and maintenance and generally have a life of 20 years.\n<br><br><b>Escalators\n</b><br>The term escalator is a combination of elevator and “scala” the latin word for steps. Escalators are the moving step type lifts operating at constant speed between two levels in an inclined course for moving large number of people in a short time. It consists of a staircase whose steps move up and down on tracks which keep them horizontal. Most escalators also have a moving handrail which approximately keeps pace with the movement of the steps. The direction of movement (up and down) can be permanently the same or can be controlled by operators according to the requirement. Generally two units are required side-by-side at each level, one moving upward and the other downward.\n<br>Gravity Chutes\n<br>Gravity chutes are used by hotels for transporting soiled linen, garbage and waste from different floors of the hotel to an outlet point (generally kept on the ground floor). It is an efficient system as minimum power is involved in operating it. Gravity chutes save workers motion, time and increase their productivity.\n<br><br><b>Dumbwaiter</b><br>A dumbwaiter is a small freight elevator or lift intended to carry food. Dumbwaiters found within modern structures, including both commercial, public and private buildings, are often connected between multiple floors. When installed in restaurants, schools, hospitals, retirement homes or in private homes, the lifts generally terminate in a kitchen.<br><br><b><i>a) Hand Operated Dumbwaiters</i></b>\n<br>\n<br>Hand operated dumbwaiters, as you might have guessed, are operated manually.  You operate the controls yourself in order to raise or lower the dumbwaiter.  They are surprisingly easy to use as they have an intricate combination of gears, brakes, and counterbalances which means you need to use very little effort and they are also very safe.  The automatic brake system that is included means that you’ll never accidentally drop the dumbwaiter as you are using it!  hand operated dumbwaiters have operating capacities of between 25 kilograms and 300 kilograms so you are sure to find one that suits your needs. They generally come in standardised sizes but you can have them custom made if you need.\n<br><br><b><i>b) Electrically Operated Dumbwaiters\n</i></b><br>Electrically operated dumbwaiters are nearly foolproof as they operate with just the push of a button. They use either the standard 240 volts, or they can operate using 415 volts.  Three phase power is most commonly required but single phase power options are becoming more common.  The equipment necessary to operate the dumbwaiter such as the motor, controller, gearbox and pulleys is hidden in a control box.  In some cases, the motor and equipment will need to be below floor level but many modern dumbwaiters have an all in one shaft so there is no need to excavate the fit the motor in.<br><br><b><i>* Window Type Dumbwaiter</i></b> – these are our most popular option. They’re small goods lifts that are installed at chest height for easily loading goods by hand. They’re most often used for the transport of food from the kitchens to the table, goods from the warehouse to the store, and books, or documents from one floor to another.\n<br><b><i>* Floor Type Dumbwaiter</i></b> – these are installed where there are goods that need to be loaded onto a forklift, or pallet truck. They are most often used for the movement of bulky items such as laundry, furniture for public events, or boxes of documentation for conference venues.\n<br><b><i>* Goods Lift Dumbwaiter</i></b> – this is a larger model, and it looks more like a traditional elevator. It features a modular structure with a self-supporting design, which means it’s easy to install as it doesn’t need a pit and shaft. The controls are on the outside because these lifts are not designed to carry people under any circumstances.<b><br></b><br><br><b>B. Horizontal Transport System\n</b><br>1. Conveyor belts (moving sidewalk, moving walk way or travellator)\n<br>2. Electric cars\n<br>3. Manual trolley for transportation of luggage.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Travellators (Moving pavements)\n</i></b><br>Travellators also known as horizontal moving sidewalks, moving walkways is a slow speed conveyor belt to transport people, they can walk along or stand on it.\n<br>They are often installed in pairs, for movement in opposite direction. Travellators may be used when there is substantial distance between the hotel entry point and the reception point.\n<br><b><i>Electric Cars</i></b>\n<br>Electric car is an electrically operated open car with 6 to 8 seats. This is an alternative to travellators and particularly very useful for disabled persons.\n<br><b><i>Manual Trolley\n</i></b><br>Manual trolley is used for transportation of luggage of guest.<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Piece Work or Piece Rate Contract\n<br>2. Lump Sum Rate Contract\n<br>3. Rate Contract\n<br>4. Service Contract\n<br>5. Multi Stage Contract\n<br>\n<br><b>Possible Circumstances for availing Contract Maintenance\n</b><br>• While contract maintenance may cover all possible types of maintenance including routine, preventive an corrective maintenance, some specific areas or circumstances might require contract maintenance as mentioned below.\n<br>• Contract Maintenance may handle special needs of a property involving special equipment's or when such needs are infrequent in nature ie. Fire Extinguishers, Lifts, Fire Alarm Systems, Detectors, Sensors etc.\n<br>• Contract Maintenance may be called upon for routine services such as janitorial services for all sorts of building interior cleaning.\n<br>• Ground maintenance and special maintenance needs like pest control activities (needing license from IPCA) are generally awarded to contract maintenance.\n<br>• In many properties, operation and maintenance of water treatment, sewage treatment and swimming pool maintenance are left to contract service owing to their very sophisticated nature.\n<br>• At small establishments, air – conditioning and refrigeration units are also maintained through contract service.\n<br>• Special equipment's are often needed for cleaning kitchen ducting, grease trap, grease filters etc., and their maintenance is also often contracted out.\n<br>\n<br><b>Role of the Maintenance Department in Contract Maintenance\n</b><br>1. Apart from identifying the areas that need to be brought under contract maintenance and choosing an appropriate contractor the Chief Engineer has to also ensure the following.\n<br>2. The contract has to carefully framed to clearly define the definite area of work to perform.\n<br>3. The Maintenance department has to closely monitor and control the reliability and quality of maintenance being carried out by them.\n<br>4. Periodic review is to be made to ascertain the need of any change in the nature of the contract including a possible change in the contractor.\n<br>5. The access to the property in areas other than the area of work should be restricted for the employees of the contractor.\n<br>6. Behavioral Issues\n<br>7. The Chief Engineer has to ensure that the contractor is following required safety standards for their employees and they are covered by appropriate insurance policies.\n<br>\n<br><b>ADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE\n</b><br>• Reduction of total labour cost.\n<br>• Reduction of cost of carrying inventory and special maintenance equipment.\n<br>• Use of latest techniques and methods of maintenance.\n<br>• Saving in administrative time on the part of the engineers when they can concentrate more on planning, etc.\n<br>• Structure and infrastructural facilities of the in-house maintenance department need not change due to introduction of new equipment's with sophisticated technology.\n<br>• Flexibility to meet emergencies\n<br>• Reduction of labour problem.\n<br>• Need to recruit and train employees is eliminated.\n<br>\n<br><b>DISADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE \n</b><br>• Labour cost is not really saved unless the actual number of in-house maintenance staff is reduced.\n<br>• Revision of contract fees in subsequent years often leads to escalation of total cost if not properly negotiated and controlled.\n<br>• Often the specialized nature of the maintenance would lead to high charges for such contracts leading to a overall increase in maintenance cost compared to if it were maintained in house.\n<br>• At the time of bidding, lack of initiative on the part of the Chief Engineer would often lead to a non-competitive price quote by a handful on contractors.\n<br>• Reduction in the number of specialized in-house maintenance crew may result in their unavailability in case of an emergency requirement for some other facility.\n<br>• The Chief Engineer does not get any information feedback regarding the status of the equipment under contract maintenance, except in case when it completely breaks down.\n<br>• Loss of control over contractor employees.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Many buildings and structures are damaged by these pests each year resulting in huge financial losses. Termite, any of a group of cellulose-eating insects, the social system of which shows remarkable parallels with those of ants and bees, although it has evolved independently. Even though termites are not closely related to ants, they are sometimes referred to as white ants. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the closest relative to the termite is the cockroach; for this reason termites are sometimes placed in the order Dictyoptera, which also contains the mantids.<br><br><b>Types of Termite</b><br>● Subterranean termites<br>● Formosan termites<br>● Damp-wood termites<br>● Dry-wood termites<br>● Cone-head termites<b><br></b><br><b>Signs of termite activity</b><br>● Discolored or drooping drywall\n<br>● Peeling paint that resembles water damage\n<br>● Wood that sounds hollow when tapped\n<br>● Small, pinpoint holes in drywall\n<br>● Buckling wooden or laminate floor boards\n<br>● Tiles loosening from the added moisture termites can introduce to your floor\n<br>● Excessively squeaky floorboards\n<br>● Crumbling, damaged wood\n<br>● Stuck windows or doors\n<br>● Maze-like patterns in furniture, floor boards or walls\n<br>● Mounds of dry-wood termite pellets, often resembling small piles of salt or pepper\n<br>● Piles of wings left behind after swarms, often resembling fish scales\n<br>● Mud tubes climbing the foundation of your home\n<br>● Flying termite swarms anywhere on your property<br><br><b>Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>\n<br>Anti-termite treatment is a chemical procedure carried out for soil, masonry, wood, and electrical fixtures to provide the building with a chemical barrier against the subterranean termites before and after construction.\n<br>Anti-termite chemicals, pre and post construction treatment, preventive measures, safety, advantages and disadvantages of anti-termite treatment are discussed in this chapter.  \n<br>The chemicals used for anti-termite treatment in buildings as per Indian Standards (IS 6313 Part-3) are :\n<br>\n<br>1. Chlorpyrifos 20 EC\n<br>2. Lindane 20 EC\n<br>\n<br>The above-mentioned chemicals are used in water emulsion for the treatment of soil in order to protect a building from termite attack. For the treatment of wood, oil or kerosene-based solution of the mentioned chemicals with 1.0% concentration is used.\n<br>\n<br><b>Pre-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>The procedure for pre-construction anti-termite treatment is given below –\n<br>1. For the excavation made for foundation, the sides and the bottom surface of the foundation trenches and pits are treated with an anti-termite chemical to a height of about 30cm at the rate of 5 Lit. per square meter of surface area.\n<br>2. For flooring, the earth surface is firstly cleaned from wooden and any other garbage particles.\n<br>3. The entire surface should be levelled to the required elevation.\n<br>4. Holes of 30 cm depth at an interval of 15 cm are made.\n<br>5. An emulsion of correct concentration (as mentioned in manufacturer’s specification) shall be made by adding water to the chemical.\n<br>6. This emulsion shall be poured in the holes by pouring jars and sprayed on the surface by using pressure pumps and sprayers.\n<br>7. The chemical is allowed to get soaked through the holes fully.\n<br>Note: The anti-termite treatment must be done by an approved specialized agency for termite-prone areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of Pre-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Less Expensive\n<br>The steps involved in Pre-construction treatment are lesser when compared to post-construction treatment. Thus the cost of the anti-termite is less.\n<br>2. Fewer Obstacles\n<br>The number of obstacles in case of Pre-construction anti-termite treatment is lesser. Major components of buildings like walls, which gives better access to every nook and corner of the buildings without any obstacles.\n<br>3. Prevention is Better than Cure\n<br>Opting for post-construction anti-termite treatment can be late as the termites might have already started doing some sort of destruction to the foundation, walls or the wooden attachments in your home. To eradicate the termite infestation from its root, pre-construction treatment is recommended.\n<br>\n<br><b>Post-Construction Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Inspection\n<br>Before undertaking any type of treatment, a thorough inspection shall be made of the infestation in the building with a view of determining the extent to which it has spread, and the routes of entry of termites into the building.\n<br>2. Extermination of Termites in Building\n<br>The inspection of the infestation gives the location of termites. The extermination inside the building shall be carried out in a thorough manner, seeking the termites in their hideouts, such as ceilings behind wooden paneling's, inside electrical wiring battens, conduits, switchboards and similar locations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Preventive Measures\n</b><br>1. The primary function of soil treatment is to establish a chemical barrier between the termites in the soil and the building to be protected.\n<br>2. To treat the soil outside of foundations, the soil in contact with the external wall of the building shall be treated with the chemical emulsion at the rate of 7.5 lit/Sqm of the vertical surface of the substructure to a depth of 300 mm.\n<br>3. The termites seek their way inside the building floor through the cracks or voids at the following locations –\n<br>(a) At the junction of the floor and walls as a result of shrinkage of the concrete.\n<br>(b) Cracks formed on the floor surface due to construction defects.\n<br>(c) At construction joints and expansion joints in a concrete floor.\n<br>4. Chemical treatment should be done in the building area of the ground floor wherever the cracks are noticed. This is done by drilling vertically 12 mm holes at the junction of floor and walls, constructional and expansion joints mentioned above at 300 mm interval to reach the soil below.\n<br>5. Treatment for wood is done at the points of contact of the woodwork. All the locations where the woodwork in the building is in contact with the woodwork must be treated with anti-termite treatment.\n<br>6. This is done by spraying at the points of contacts with the adjoining masonry with the chemical emulsion of concentration by drilling 6mm holes at a downward angle of about 45° at the junction of woodwork and masonry.\n<br>7. Treatment of electrical fixtures such as switch boxes in the wall is done by removing the outer coverings and treating the internal parts with 5 percent Malathion dusting powder.\n<br>\n<br><b>Safety</b>\n<br>1. All works shall comply with the safety procedure or instruction as set out in project safety plan and municipality rules and regulations.\n<br>2. Basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shall be worn by all staff or laborers.\n<br>3. All operatives shall be inducted before entering the site.\n<br>\n<b><br>Advantages of Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. It provides immediate protection to any structure from termites, rodents, and pests.\n<br>2. It lasts for several years.\n<br>3. It eliminates the problem of gaps forming in the protection barrier, allowing termites to enter the home.\n<br>4. Liquid termiticides are relatively inexpensive when compared to other forms of termite control.\n<br>\n<br><b>Disadvantages of Anti-Termite Treatment\n</b><br>1. Anti-Termite treatment can lead to water contamination in areas close to waterways or wetlands.\n<br>2. Drilling into areas that show evidence of termite entry, or concrete may be necessary, which can reduce the strength of the member or structure.\n<br>3. Any small negligence or left out portion can lead to problems with an infestation in future.\n<br>\n<br><b>Maintain the Termite Prevention Features\n</b><br>• After construction, keep the soil around the foundation dry through proper grading and drainage (including maintenance of gutters and downspouts).\n<br>• Reduce openings that offer termites access to the structure (filling cracks in cement foundations as well as around where utilities pass through the wall with cement, grout, or caulk).\n<br>• Fix leaks immediately.\n<br>• Keep vents free from blockage, including plants.\n<br>• Ensure that trees and shrubs are not planted too close to the structure and do not allow them to grow against exposed wood surfaces.\n<br>• Do not pile or store firewood or wood debris next to the house.\n<br>• Inspect periodically to help ensure that termite colonies do not become established.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

FRAME TYPE CONSTRUCTION\n<br>B. LOAD BEARING MASONRY WALL CONSTRUCTION\n<br>C. PRE ENGINEERED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION\n<br>D. LIGHT GAUGE STEEL STRUCTURES\n<br>\n<br><b>A. FRAME TYPE CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br><i>1.CONCRETE FRAME CONSTRUCTION\n</i><br>Concrete frame construction is probably the most common kind of construction system used in the world today. As the name suggests, this has a skeleton of concrete, that is covered in a skin. The skin can be made of brick, aluminium or glass, and is attached to the outer surface of the building.\n<br><i>2.STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</i><br>Steel is an immensely strong and flexible material. This is why steel frame structures are ideal for earthquake-prone areas.\n<br><i>3.WOOD FRAMED CONSTRUCTION\n</i><br>Wood framed construction is widely used for residential and low-rise structures in North America and Europe.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. LOAD BEARING MASONRY WALL CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Load bearing masonry walls is a form of construction that was used widely from the 1700s to the mid-1900s. It consists of heavy brick or stone walls that support horizontal floor slabs.\n<br>\n<br><b>C. PRE ENGINEERED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</b>\n<br>Pre-engineered metal buildings are a fast, economical type of construction best suited to warehouses and industrial buildings.\n<br>\n<br><b>D.LIGHT GAUGE STEEL STRUCTURES</b>\n<br>Light gauge steel construction is very widely used for residential and low-rise buildings in the US and Europe. It is very similar to light wood construction.\n<br>\n<br><b>1.CONCRETE FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Concrete frame structures are a very common - or perhaps the most common- type of modern building internationally. As the name suggests, this type of building consists of a frame or skeleton of concrete. Horizontal members of this frame are called beams, and vertical members are called columns. Humans walk on flat planes of concrete called slabs (see figure at the bottom of the page for an illustration of each of the major parts of a frame structure). Of these, the column is the most important, as it is the primary load-carrying element of the building . If you damage a beam or slab in a building, this will affect only one floor, but damage to a column could bring down the entire building.\n<br>When we say concrete in the building trade, we actually mean reinforced concrete. Its full name is reinforced cement concrete, or RCC. RCC is concrete that contains steel bars, called reinforcement bars, or re bars. This combination works very well, as concrete is very strong in compression, easy to produce at site, and inexpensive, and steel is very very strong in tension. To make reinforced concrete, one first makes a mold, called form work, that will contain the liquid concrete and give it the form and shape we need. Then one looks at the structural engineer's drawings and places in the steel reinforcement bars, and ties them in place using wire. The tied steel is called a reinforcement cage, because it is shaped like one.\n<br>Once the steel is in place, one can start to prepare the concrete, by mixing cement, sand, stone chips in a range of sizes, and water in a cement mixer, and pouring in the liquid concrete into the form work till exactly the right level is reached. The concrete will become hard in a matter of hours, but takes a month to reach its full strength. Therefore it is usually propped up until that period. During this time the concrete must be cured, or supplied with water on its surface, which it needs for the chemical reactions within to proceed properly.\n<br>Working out the exact 'recipe', or proportions of each ingredient is a science in itself. It is called concrete mix design. A good mix designer will start with the properties that are desired in the mix, then take many factors into account, and work out a detailed mix design. A site engineer will often order a different type of mix for a different purpose. For example, if he is casting a thin concrete wall in a hard-to-reach area, he will ask for a mix that is more flow able than stiff. This will allow the liquid concrete to flow by gravity into every corner of the form work. For most construction applications, however, a standard mix is used.\n<br>Common examples of standard mixes are M20, M30, M40 concrete, where the number refers to the strength of the concrete in n/mm2 or newtons per square millimeter. Therefore M30 concrete will have a comprehensive strength of 30 n/mm2. A standard mix may also specify the maximum aggregate size. Aggregates are the stone chips used in concrete. If an engineer specifies M30 / 20 concrete, he wants M30 concrete with a maximum aggregate size of 20mm. He does NOT want concrete with a strength of between 20-30 n/mm2, which is a common misinterpretation in some parts of the world.\n<br>So the structure is actually a connected frame of members, each of which are firmly connected to each other. In engineering parlance, these connections are called moment connections, which means that the two members are firmly connected to each other. There are other types of connections, including hinged connections, which are used in steel structures, but concrete frame structures have moment connections in 99.9% of cases. This frame becomes very strong, and must resist the various loads that act on a building during its life.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>These loads include:\n</i></b><br>    * Dead Loads: the downwards force on the building coming from the weight of the building itself, including the structural elements, walls, facades, and the like.\n<br>    * Live Loads: the downwards force on the building coming from the expected weight of the occupants and their possessions, including furniture, books, and so on. Normally these loads are specified in building codes and structural engineers must design buildings to carry these or greater loads. These loads will vary with the use of the space, for example, whether it is residential, office, industrial to name a few. It is common for codes to require live loads for residential to be a minimum of about 200 kg/m2, offices to be 250 kg/m2, and industrial to be 1000 kg/m2, which is the same as 1T/m2. These live loads are sometimes called imposed loads.\n<br>    * Dynamic Loads: these occur commonly in bridges and similar infrastructure, and are the loads created by traffic, including braking and accelerating loads.\n<br>    * Wind Loads: This is a very important design factor, especially for tall buildings, or buildings with large surface area. Buildings are designed not to resist the everyday wind conditions, but extreme conditions that may occur once every 100 years or so. These are called design wind speeds, and are specified in building codes. A building can commonly be required to resist a wind force of 150 kg/m2, which can be a very significant force when multiplied by the surface area of the building.\n<br>    * Earthquake Loads: in an earthquake, the ground vigorously shakes the building both horizontally and vertically, rather like a bucking horse shakes a rider in the sport of rodeo. This can cause the building to fall apart. The heavier the building, the greater the force on it. Its important to note that both wind and earthquake impose horizontal forces on the building, unlike the gravity forces it normally resists, which are vertical in direction.\n<br>The concrete frame rests on foundations, which transfer the forces - from the building and on the building - to the ground. Some other important components of concrete frame structures are:\n<br>Shear Walls are important structural elements in high-rise buildings. Shear walls are essentially very large columns - they could easily measure 400mm thick by 3m long - making them appear like walls rather than columns. Their function in a building is to help take care of horizontal forces on buildings like wind and earthquake loads. Normally, buildings are subject to vertical loads - gravity. Shear walls also carry vertical loads. It is important to understand that they only work for horizontal loads in one direction - the axis of the long dimension of the wall. These are usually not required in low-rise structures.\n<br>Elevator Shafts are vertical boxes in which the elevators move up and down - normally each elevator is enclosed in its own concrete box. These shafts are also very good structural elements, helping to resist horizontal loads, and also carrying vertical loads.\n<br>\n<br><i><b>WALLS IN CONCRETE FRAME BUILDINGS</b>\n</i><br>Concrete frame structures are strong and economical. Hence almost any walling materials can be used with them. The heavier options include masonry walls of brick, concrete block, or stone. The lighter options include drywall partitions made of light steel or wood studs covered with sheeting boards. The former are used when strong, secure, and sound-proof enclosures are required, and the latter when quick, flexible lightweight partitions are needed.When brick or concrete blocks are used, it is common to plaster the entire surface - brick and concrete - with a cement plaster to form a hard, long-lasting finish.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>CLADDING OF CONCRETE FRAME STRUCTURES\n</i></b><br>Concrete frame buildings can be clad with any kind of cladding material. Common cladding materials are glass, aluminium panels, stone sheets, and ceramic facades. Since these structures can be designed for heavy loading, one could even clad them in solid masonry walls of brick or stone.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Most steel construction is done with a type of steel called mild steel. Mild steel is a material that is immensely strong. Take a circular bar of steel 1 inch / 25mm in diameter. If you were to attach this bar securely to your ceiling, you could hang from it 20,000 Kg (which is 20 tons), This immense strength is of great advantage to buildings. The other important feature of steel framing is its flexibility. It can bend without cracking, which is another great advantage, as a steel building can flex when it is pushed to one side by say, wind, or an earthquake. The third characteristic of steel is its plasticity or ductility. This means that when subjected to great force, it will not suddenly crack like glass, but slowly bend out of shape. This property allows steel buildings to bend out of shape, or deform, thus giving warning to inhabitants to escape. Failure in steel frames is not sudden - a steel structure rarely collapses. Steel in most cases performs far better in earthquake than most other materials because of these properties.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>WHERE STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES ARE USED</i></b>\n<br>Steel construction is most often used in\n<br>● High rise buildings because of its strength, low weight, and speed of construction\n<br>● Industrial buildings because of its ability to create large span spaces at low cost\n<br>● Warehouse buildings for the same reason\n<br>● Residential buildings in a technique called light gauge steel construction\n<br>● Temporary Structures as these are quick to set up and remove\n<br>\n<br><b><i>TYPES OF STEEL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION\n</i></b><br>There are several types of steel building construction. Steel construction is also called steel fabrication.\n<br>Conventional Steel Fabrication is when teams of steel fabricators cut members of steel to the correct lengths, and then weld them together to make the final structure. This can be done entirely at the construction site, which is labour-intensive, or partially in a workshop, to provide better working conditions and reduce time.\n<br>Bolted Steel Construction occurs when steel fabricators produce finished and painted steel components, which are then shipped to the site and simply bolted in place. This is the preferred method of steel construction, as the bulk of the fabrication can be done in workshops, with the right machinery, lighting, and work conditions. The size of the components are governed by the size of the truck or trailer they are shipped in, usually with a max length of 6m (20ft) for normal trucks or 12m (40ft) for long trailers. Since the only work to be done at site is lifting the steel members into place (with cranes) and bolting, the work at site is tremendously fast. Pre-engineered buildings are an example of bolted steel construction that is designed, fabricated, shipped and erected by one company to the owner.\n<br>Light Gauge Steel Construction is a type of construction that is common for residential and small buildings in North America and parts of Europe. This is similar to wood framed construction, except that light gauge steel members are used in place of wood two-by-fours. Light gauge steel is steel that is in the form of thin (1-3mm) sheets of steel that have been bent into shape to form C-sections or Z-sections.\n<br>\n<br><b>WEIGHT OF STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES\n</b><br>Consider a single storey building measuring 5 x 8m (16 x 26ft). Let us first construct this in concrete, with four columns at the corners, beams spanning between the columns, and a 150mm (6\") thick concrete slab at the top. Such a structure would weigh about 800 kg/m2, or 32 Tons (32,000 kg) in total. If we build this of steel instead, with a sloping roof covered with corrugated metal sheeting with insulation, this would weigh only about 65 kg/m2. The steel framed building will weigh only 2.6 Tons (2,600 kg). So the concrete building is over 12 times heavier! This is for single storey structures - in multi-storey structures, the difference will be less, as the floors in multi-storey steel buildings are built of concrete slabs for economy - but the difference is still significant.\n<br>This low weight of steel frame buildings means that they have to be firmly bolted to the foundations to resist wind forces, else they could be blown away like deck umbrellas!\n<br>\n<br><b><i>ADVANTAGES OF STEEL STRUCTURES</i></b>\n<br>Steel structures have the following advantages:\n<br>● They are super-quick to build at site, as a lot of work can be pre-fabbed at the factory.\n<br>● They are flexible, which makes them very good at resisting dynamic (changing) forces such as wind or earthquake forces.\n<br>● A wide range of ready-made structural sections are available, such as I, C, and angle sections\n<br>● They can be made to take any kind of shape, and clad with any type of material\n<br>● A wide range of joining methods is available, such as bolting, welding, and riveting\n<br>\n<br><b><i>DISADVANTAGES OF STEEL STRUCTURES\n</i></b><br>Steel structures have the following disadvantages:\n<br>● They lose strength at high temperatures, and are susceptible to fire.\n<br>● They are prone to corrosion in humid or marine environments.\n<br>\n<br><b>C.WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Light wood framed construction is one of the most popular types of building methods for homes in the United States and parts of Europe. It has the following characteristics:\n<br>1. It is light, and allows quick construction with no heavy tools or equipment. Every component can easily be carried by hand - a house essentially becomes a large carpentry job. The main tool is a handheld nail gun.\n<br>2. It is able to adapt itself to any geometric shape, and can be clad with a variety of materials.\n<br>3. There are a huge variety of products and systems tailored to this type of construction.\n<br>It has these negative characteristics:\n<br>1. It is not highly fireproof, as it is made of wood.\n<br>2. It is not strong enough to resist major wind events such as tornadoes and hurricanes.\n<br>Every timber frame home structure is made of a few basic components:\n<br>Studs are vertical wooden members within the walls.\n<br>Joists are the horizontal wooden beams that support the floors.\n<br>Rafters are the sloping wooden beams that support the roof.\n<br>Sheathing are the sheets that are nailed over the studs to connect them securely and form the wall surfaces.\n<br>Siding is the exterior cladding that covers the walls from the outside.\n<br>\n<br><b>D. LOAD BEARING MASONRY CONSTRUCTION\n</b><br>Load bearing masonry construction was the most widely used form of construction for large buildings from the 1700s to the mid-1900s. It is very rarely used today for large buildings, but smaller residential-scale structures are being built. It essentially consists of thick, heavy masonry walls of brick or stone that support the entire structure, including the horizontal floor slabs, which could be made of reinforced concrete, wood, or steel members.\n<br>In contrast, most construction today is not load-bearing masonry but frame structures of light but strong materials, that support floor slabs and have very thin and light internal and external walls.\n<br>The key idea with this construction is that every wall acts as a load carrying element. In a load bearing structure, you cannot punch holes in a wall to connect two rooms - you would damage the structure if you did so. The immense weight of the walls actually helps to hold the building together and stabilize it against external forces such as wind and earthquake.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>DISADVANTAGES OF LOAD BEARING WALL CONSTRUCTION\n</i></b><br>Load bearing masonry construction is not used today for a number of reasons:\n<br>1. It does not perform very well in earthquakes. Most deaths in earthquakes around the world have occurred in load bearing masonry buildings. Earthquakes love heavy buildings, because that is where they can wreak the greatest havoc.\n<br>2. It is extremely labor-intensive, as it is built mainly of masonry, which is made by hand. Humans have still not developed a machine that produces masonry! This also makes for very slow construction speeds in comparison with modern methods that are far more mechanized.\n<br>3. It is extremely material-intensive. These buildings consume a lot of bricks, and are very heavy. This means that they are not green, as all this material has to be trucked around from where it is produced to the site.\n<br>\n<br><b>Difference between load bearing and framed structure:\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>LOAD BEARING STRUCTURE\n</i></b><br>• Construction cost is less.\n<br>• Suitable up to three stories.\n<br>• Walls are thicker and hence floor area is reduced.\n<br>• Slow construction work.\n<br>• Not possible to alter the position of walls, after the construction.\n<br>• Resistance to earthquake is poor.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>FRAME STRUCTURE\n</i></b><br>• Construction cost is more.\n<br>• Suitable for any number of stories.\n<br>• Walls are thinner and hence more floor area available for use.\n<br>• Construction speed is fast.\n<br>• Position of walls may be changed, whenever necessary.\n<br>• Resistance to earthquake forces is good.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Causes of Damp Wall\n<br>2. Effects of Dampness in Wall\n<br>3. Remedies.\n<br>\n<br><b>Causes of Damp Wall:\n</b><br>There are various causes of ingress of moisture in walls which make them damp:\n<br>i. Defective roof-leakage is a major source of water entering the wall and making it damp.\n<br>ii. Porous bricks used in construction is a permanent source of dampness in walls as they attract  moisture. \n<br>iii. Bad materials used in construction are also a source of damp wall.\n<br>iv. Vegetation – Growth of vegetation in the wall indicates presence of moisture or water without which it could not grow. Vegetation develops further cracks in a wall already having cracks and cause leakage in the wall. \n<br>v. Earth backing against wall – Dumping of earth against wall causes dampness in it.\n<br>vi. Cavities, holes left in the wall due to negligence and dab-holes kept for erection of scaffolding and  later not filled properly with concrete are a prospective source of attracting and storing moisture. \n<br>vii. Mortar joints not laid properly and uniformly are sources of attracting moisture.\n<br>viii. The worst source of moisture ingress in building wall is the defective damp proof course.  Decayed, dilapidated or defectively laid damp proof course, i.e., failure of the damp proof course to arrest rising of moisture from below causes dampness in wall. \n<br>ix. Earth banks – Construction of earthen bank by the side of a building, side slope covering some  height of the wall above damp proof course would cause dampness in wall. \n<br>x. Splashing of rain off the ground on the wall above the damp proof course which happens when the  plinth height is low or there be ground nearby with higher level. \n<br>xi. Defective window sills allowing stagnation of water on it.\n<br>xii. Sloping ground – This generally happens in hill areas, where buildings are constructed on the  slopes of the hills. \n<br>xiii. Dampness in hollow walls is caused due to deposit of mortar droppings during construction and  lack of ventilation. \n<br>xiv. Leaking pipes – Soil, waste water, rain water, or water supply pipes allowing water to enter the  walls. \n<br>xv. Salt in the plaster – Presence of salt in the plaster or precisely in sand used for plaster will render  the wall damp. \n<br>\n<br><b>Effects of Dampness in Wall:\n</b><br>There are many injurious effects which are a direct result of dampness in walls of buildings:\n<br>i. Unhygienic condition inside the building – inviting various diseases to the inmates.\n<br>ii. Decay – The action of moisture on the different portions of the structure induce decay and  disintegration of materials like bricks, stone, steel, timber, etc. as continuous presence of moisture in the portions causes growth of moss, fungus and corrosion. \n<br>iii. Dry rot – The presence of moisture in timber causes the disease in the timber, termed dry rot. Dry rot is effective due to presence of a virulent type of fungus allied to mushroom type. \n<br>iv. Disintegration – Continued presence of moisture in brick may cause mechanical injury to the wall.  If there are cracks in the wall or porosity which may retain water in freezing temperature, the water will freeze, increase in volume and cause severe damage. \n<br>v. Efflorescence – It is produced by the entrance of moisture in the brickwork which usually contains  various soluble salts. These salts are dissolved by the water and issuing from the pores of the bricks, they crystallize and cause disintegration of bricks. \n<br>vi. Furniture – They are damaged due to continuous damp environment.\n<br>vii. Decoration of timber, bamboo, wall papering, etc. get damaged.\n<br>viii. Warping and decay of timber.\n<br>ix. Plaster getting soft and subsequently crumbling.\n<br>x. Corrosion of metal.\n<br>xi. Damage to electrical installations and short circuiting.\n<br>xii. Deterioration of floor covering.\n<br>xiii. Infestation of termite.\n<br>xiv. Blistering, flaking and bleaching of paint.\n<br>\n<br><b>Remedies to Damp Wall:\n</b><br>Remedies to damp wall may be temporary or permanent according to the exigency. Again, treatment  to remove dampness would be different for internal and external walls. \n<br>\n<br><b>Temporary Remedies:\n</b><br>Temporary remedies for internal walls:\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. Application of bituminous painting:\n</i></b><br>The affected wall is to be cleaned, allowed to be dried and then a coat of hot bitumen applied  uniformly. However, if there be difficulty in applying hot bitumen, bituminous compound emulsions are available in the market which may be applied cold with brush. \n<br><b><i>2. Painting with water proofing solution:\n</i></b><br>Either commercially available such solutions or prepared solution as described later may be applied as  prescribed after cleaning the surface. \n<br><b><i>3. Applying cement wash:\n</i></b><br>This is an easy method. Cement and water mixed in thin consistency with admixture of adhesive gum  may be applied one or more coats after cleaning the surface. \n<br>\n<br><b>Temporary Remedies for External Walls:\n</b><br>1. Applying water proofing solutions as mentioned above.\n<br>2. Coating with boiled linseed oil or commercially available linseed oil may be boiled and applied hot  with brush after cleaning the surface. \n<br>3. Applying cement wash as mentioned above.\n<br>4. Sylvester’s Process – Applying alternate coats of soap and alum solutions to the walls where they  will sink into the pores just below the surface. The first coat to be applied after cleaning the surface. Subsequent coats to be applied after the previous coat have dried up. \n<br>5. Painting paraffin – Paraffin oil may be painted over the affected surface after cleaning.\n<br>6. Applying bituminous paint as mentioned above. Application of bitumen or bituminous paint on  walls internal or external though may be effective, will render the wall surface look unpleasant. \n<br>\n<br><b>Permanent Remedies:\n</b><br>Before selecting a method for permanent remedy against dampness in walls, the cause of dampness, shall have to be investigated. Once the cause is established, the action to be taken for remedial measure would not be difficult. The  main object would be to remove the cause. In most of the cases, removal would not be difficult. As for example: \n<br>\n<br>1. Dampness due to leakage from the roof – Stop the roof leakage.\n<br>2. Vegetation – Removal of the vegetation including uprooting and applying chemical solution so that  growth may not recur and sealing if there be any crack. \n<br>3. Earth backing, bank, sloping ground, etc. – The space around the building need be dressed to avoid splashing of water on the wall. \n<br>4. Cavities, holes, etc. – Detect the exact spot, open the space and fill the cavity with concrete.\n<br>5. Defective window sills – These are to be corrected.\n<br>6. Dampness in hollow walls – The main purpose of constructing hollow walls is defeated. Utmost  care must be taken during construction to avoid dropping of mortar. The outer leaf of the wall which is a non-load bearing, may be opened partially for removing the dropped mortar and cleaning. Further, weep holes may be provided below horizontal damp proof course and air bricks may be  provided at suitable places for ventilation. \n<br>7. Salt in plaster – This is due to using bad quality sand during construction. In such case, there is no other alternative than to remove the plaster and apply new rendering with salt free sand. \n<br>8. Leaking pipes – The location need be traced correctly. These mainly happen in cases of soil and waste water pipes, when the pipes from inside the building pass through the wall for coming out. In most cases, there are joints at these locations. These joints need be opened up from outside and the joints or leaks repaired. As the pipe is in horizontal position, the joint must be lead caulked. In cases of rain water pipes, probable location is at the intake mouth at roof level or just below. In such case, the location need be opened carefully and the joint repaired with sand and cement mortar. In cases of water supply pipes, if the pipes laid are exposed, locating the leakage is not difficult.\n<br>In cases of concealed pipes, the identification of the location is not much difficult as the dampness in the wall would indicate the position. The spot need be opened and the leak repaired. \n<br>9. In cases of dampness due to use of porous bricks and bad materials, the solution would be to  demolish the portions and reconstruct those portions with better bricks and materials. If this is not possible due to economic reasons, the remedy would be to remove the plaster from either side and then re-plaster with new mortar of richer proportion with admixture of water-proofing compound. The external plaster should be in two layers, the first layer should be laid over the brick surface after cleaning and raking the joints. 20 mm thick cement sand plaster, 1: 4 over which the second layer of plaster 10 mm thick, 1: 3 to be laid with admixture of water proofing compound. The internal plaster should be single layer 20 mm thick cement and sand 1: 4. \n<br>10. In cases of mortar joints not laid properly – This is a construction defect. The plaster on both the  faces should be removed. The mortar joints should be opened up to 20 mm deep and raked properly and then re-plastered.  \n<br>11. Damp proof course – Damp proofing of a building is achieved by using suitable damp proofing  material which should satisfy the condition to be impervious to the moisture. Now, due to absence of damp proof course or due to bad construction if the damp proof course provided does not satisfy the condition above and moisture rises through the damp proof course and the walls get damp and consequently other ills appear, the commonest method in dealing with the wet rising from the soil by capillary action is insertion of a new damp proof course or replacing the old one. The simple method is to remove two layers of bricks right through the thickness of the wall at the damp proof course level. The bottom course is then replaced, after being reduced in thickness equal to the thickness of the proposed damp proof course to provide room for insertion of the damp proof course. When the lower course has been replaced, it should be covered with a bed of cement mortar 12 mm thick so as to get a uniform bearing all over. Over this, the damp proof course made of cement concrete 1: 1 ½ : 3 with admixture of water proofing compound is to be laid. Then the remaining course of brick is replaced. \n<br>\n<br>They must be well buttered with cement mortar, and after being pushed into the opening, they can  be wedged down into intimate contact with the damp proof course tightly into the top bed joint. The operation should be carried out from the outside and in segments of 1.0 m to 1.2 m in length. Alternate segments are to be taken up. The whole process should be carried out slowly and with precision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

During check-out, guests formally Vacate their rooms, settle their bills, and leave the hotel. This phase is very crucial as guests settle their financial transactions with the hotel, and any dispute at this stage can ruin their entire experience. On the other hand, a smooth settlement of bills and check-out would enhance the guests' experience. As every hotel endeavors to achieve high levels of guest satisfaction, the activities of the various department should be coordinated to ensure a smooth check-out. The speed and accuracy in the preparation and presentation of bills will lead to the maximization of guest satisfaction. Error-free billing and speedy processing of check-out requests reflects the professionalism of the hotel and imparts a lasting good impression to the guest.\n<br>\n<br>The departure procedure may vary slightly from hotel to hotel according to the degree of automation of the organization. The following steps are involved in the departure procedure in manual or semi-automated systems:\n<br>\n<br>● The check-out request is received at the front desk or bell desk.\n<br>● The front desk sends a bell boy to transfer the guest's luggage from the room to the lobby.\n<br>●The bell boy fills the departure errand card.\n<br>● The front desk sends departure notification slips (DNS) to all concerned departments\n<br>● The front desk alerts all points of sale to rush last-minute credit transactions to the front desk.\n<br>● The front desk cashier updates the guest folio based on recent bills received from the points of sales.\n<br>● The guest arrives at the front desk for check-out and hands over the room keys.\n<br>● The cashier prepares the master bill and presents it to the guest, along With supporting vouchers and bills, for review.\n<br>● The payment is received from the guest as per the pre-determined mode of payment.\n<br>● The front desk makes the 'luggage out' pass \n<br>● Marketing activities are carried out—the front desk communicates special offers, gives out brochures, takes future bookings, etc.\n<br>● The front desk communicates the check-out information to housekeeping and all the other concerned departments.\n<br>● The front office assistant updates the following front office records:\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>1. Current room status—by removing the name slip from the room rack at the information desk.\n<br>2. Guest history card.\n<br>3. Arrival/Departure register.\n<br>\n<br><b>Check-out Request</b> A request for check-out is received from the guest either at the front desk or at the bell desk. This information is communicated to all the concerned departments and points of sales. While processing the check-out request, the front desk agent should confirm the guest's details like name, room number, etc., and check the departure date. In case of early departure (i.e., the guest would like to leave before the departure date mentioned at the time of registration), other departments should be informed.\n<br>\n<br>Luggage Handling The front desk requests the bell captain to send a bell boy to transfer the guest’s luggage to the lobby. The bell boy fills the departure errand card and the bell captain makes an entry in the bell captain control sheet. The bell boy goes to the guest room, knocks on the door, and announces himself. After getting due permission from the guest, he enters the room and carries the guest’s luggage to the lobby.\n<br>Apart from carrying the luggage of the guest, the bell boy is also expected to do the following:\n<br>\n<br>● Look around the room for signs of any damage to the hotel property.\n<br>● Draw the curtains and lock the balcony and windows.\n<br>● Check for any guest belongings left behind by mistake.\n<br>● Collect the room keys from the guest.\n<br>● Check the mini-bar consumption or politely enquire from the guest about the same.\n<br>● Lock the room and hang the 'clean my room' tag on the doorknob, so that the housekeeping department can quickly clean the room for the next occupant.\n<br>\n<br><b>Accounting All Transactions</b> The front desk informs housekeeping and all points of sale to rush the latest credit transactions to the front desk so that the cashier can add them to the guest account. It is very difficult to get payment for unpaid bills after the guest has checked out unless she has gone to another hotel in the same chain or is going to return to the hotel later. As the guest might refuse to pay any charges after she has checked out, the hotel should ensure that all transactions have been billed to the guest at the time of account settlement.\n<br>\n<br><b>Updating Guest Folio </b>The front desk cashier updates the guest folio by Adding the latest credit transactions received from the points of sale.\n<br>● Checking if any late checkout charges are applicable; i.e., if the check-out time is 12 noon and the guest checks out at 6 p.m., he will be charged for late check-out.\n<br>● Checking for any late charges, i.e., if there are any latest bills that have not been added to the guest account.\n<br>● Examining the current entries in the guest account.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bill </b>Guest bills are prepared based on guest folios. While preparing the bill, the front desk staff should check if late check-out charges are applicable. If so, they should be added to the master bill. The check-out time is the time fixed by the hotel to mark the end of the day. A departing guest should vacate the room by the check-out time, which is generally 12 noon, else he would incur late check-out charges. Late check-out charges are normally a point of contention between the hotel and the guest. To avoid such a situation, guests are often asked about their expected departure time at the reservation stage itself. At the time of registration, they are again informed about the extra charges in case of late check-out.\n<br>\n<br>The front desk cashier should also pay special care to late charges while preparing the bills for settlement. A late charge is an outstanding payment from the guest, the bill for which reaches the front desk cashier after the master bill has been prepared. Some common examples of late charges are:\n<br>● Laundry bills\n<br>● Telephone bills\n<br>● Breakfast bills\n<br>● Mini-bar consumption\n<br>\n<br>If the late charges reach the front desk after the guest has settled his bill and checked out, the hotel will have to bear the loss. To reduce the losses due to the late arrival of charges, the cashier should confirm from all the points of sale about any outstanding charges for the departing guest and also enquire about the mini-bar consumption from the guest before<br>● Preparing the master bill.\n<br>● In manual hotel operation, the front office follows the given procedure to prepare a guest’s bill:\n<br>● Prepare bills in duplicate.\n<br>● Check the room number.\n<br>● Take out the guest folio.\n<br>● Calculate the correct number of room nights and establish whether a late check-out charge is to be added.\n<br>● Enter the guest’s credit transactions in the master bill in the order of their occurrence.\n<br>● Enter the method of payment (cash, credit card, the bill to a company, etc.).\n<br>● Present the bills, along with supporting vouchers, to the guest for review.\n<br>● Once the guest has verified the charges and made the payment, give the top copy of the bill to the guest.\n<br>● File the second copy in the night auditor’s file.\n<br>\n<br><b>Determination of Mode of Payment</b> The method of settlement of bills is generally established during registration or even before, at the reservation stage. The methods of payment of bills may be cash—in local and foreign currency; cash equivalents like demand draft, traveler’s cheque, and a debit card; or through credit modes like a charge card, credit card, travel agent vouchers, and corporate billings. The front desk is generally aware about the mode of settlement of bills. This information\n<br>helps the front desk cashier to do necessary verification in case of credit payments or take authorization from superiors in case the bill is to be settled by personal cheque, which is normally not entertained by most of the hotels.\n<br>\n<br><b>Receiving Payment</b> The guest reviews the bill and makes the payment in the pre-decided mode. The payment may be made through currency notes, traveler’s cheque, personal cheque, demand draft, debit card, credit card, charge card, travel agent voucher, and a bill to the company. The front desk cashier follows the house policy in collecting the payment from the guest.\n<br>\n<br><b>Marketing Activity</b> As the guest and the hotel staff come face-to-face for the last time at the check-out stage, the front office should use this opportunity for marketing efforts in the following ways:\n<br>● The front desk should ask guests about their experience at the hotel and ask them to fill a feedback form.\n<br>● If guests have any complaints, the front desk should note the same and assure the guests of a quick resolution.\n<br>● The front desk agent should inform the guest about upcoming special offers.\n<br>● The front desk agent may suggest making a future reservation for the guest’s return trip or a hotel in the same chain at the guest’s next destination.\n<br>\n<br><b>Communicating Departure to All Departments</b> The front desk informs all. departments about the departure of a guest to ensure the smooth operation of the hotel. The points of sale will not offer credit facility to guests who have already settled their bills and politely ask them to make a direct payment. The housekeeping department will do the following:\n<br>\n<br>● Prepare the room for the next guest.\n<br>● Block the room for special cleaning processes, like spring cleaning.\n<br>● Look for maintenance requirements in the room.\n<br>● Re-furnish the room for future sales.\n<br>\n<br>To ensure proper room management, both the front office and housekeeping must inform each other of the change in room status. As soon as a guest checks out, the front office must inform the housekeeping so that the latter cleans the room and makes it available for sale. A flow of information in the reverse direction is equally necessary. The housekeeping prepares the ‘housekeeping report’ at the end of a shift, which indicates the housekeeping status of each room—whether rooms are\n<br>ready for occupation, under repair, or out of order. The housekeeping department uses room status codes to indicate the status of rooms. This report is sent to the front office, where it is compared to the front office occupancy report and discrepancies are sorted out. The close coordination between the front office and housekeeping keeps the room status information up-to-date, leading to maximum benefit to the hotel.\n<br>\n<br><b>Updating Front Office Records</b> When some guests depart from a hotel, the rooms they had been occupying become vacant. The front desk agent should update the hotel records related to room status at the earliest so that the rooms can be sold again. The front office should also update guest history cards for marketing and research purposes.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Room status records</i></b> As soon as a guest checks out, the front desk agent updates the following records related to the status of the room:\n<br>● The front office removes the name of the guest from the room rack at the information desk, so that the room shows as vacant and can be given to another guest.\n<br>●&nbsp; The front desk changes the status of the room in the front office occupancy report from occupied to vacant/dirty, so that the room can be cleaned and made ready for another guest.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Guest history</i></b> card Generally, most hotels maintain a record of their guests, with details like previous arrival and departure dates, type of room and rate charged, likes and dislikes of guests, the amount spent by them, any special requests. This record is known as the guest history card or GHC. Hotels prepare the GHCs of corporate clients also. A GHC serves the following purposes:\n<br>● It provides current marketing data.\n<br>● The demo-graphical data of the guest—age, sex, income, occupation, marital status, etc_—helps to develop new marketing strategies.\n<br>● The knowledge of the guest’s likes and dislikes helps in serving the guest better.\n<br>● The information in GHC reveals the frequency of a guest’s visits. If the guest is a frequent user of the hotel, her name may be entered in the frequent user, list and promotional offers and special rates may be offered to her.\n<br>\n<br><b>Departure Procedure in Fully Automated System\n</b><br>The departure procedure in a hotel running on a fully automated system is smoother and more efficient. It involves the following steps:\n<br>● The check-out request is received at the front desk or bell desk.\n<br>● The front desk sends a bell boy to transfer luggage from the guest room to the lobby.\n<br>● The front desk informs all points of sale and other departments of the hotel about the departing guest through the interlinked computer network.\n<br>● Since all the points of sale terminals are interlinked, any credit transaction of the guest will instantaneously get added to the guest folio.\n<br>● The front desk prepares the master bill by selecting the bill option of the cashier module.\n<br>● The front office presents the master bill, along with supporting vouchers, to the guest for review.\n<br>● The payment is received from the guest as per the predetermined mode of payment.\n<br>● The front office makes the luggage out pass.\n<br>● The front desk communicates the departure of the guest to housekeeping and all the other concerned departments.\n<br>● The front office records are updated automatically. These include:\n<br>1. The auto removal of the name of the departed guest from the in-house guest name list.\n<br>2.The automatic updating of the current room status—from occupied to vacant/dirty.\n<br>3. The automatic updating of the guest history card.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The departure procedure should be simple and short. The guests who are checking out of the hotel are often in a hurry to catch a flight or a train. Hotels should take measures to avoid the formation of long queues at the front desk during peak check-out periods. A speedy check-out procedure and an error-free billing\n<br>leave a lasting good impression on the guest. A guest who leaves the hotel with a good impression will return to the hotel/chain and will also recommend the hotel chain to her friends and relatives. Despite measures taken by hotels to avoid problems during the check-out process, the following problems may occur during the departure of a guest:\n<br>● Late check out\n<br>● Long queues at the cashier counter\n<br>● Improper posting of charges in the guest folio\n<br>\n<br>These problems can be rectified by informing the guests about check-in and check-out times at the time of registration, installing self check-out terminals, and implementing an accurate guest accounting system.\n<br>\n<br><b>Late Check-outs\n</b><br>Most hotels have a fixed check-out time—generally 12 noon—at which the departing guests must vacate their rooms and settle their bills. If a guest vacates his room after the check-out time, it is considered late check-out. This may create a problem. especially during high occupancy periods, as the guests with confirmed reservations will be required to wait for the room to be vacated and cleaned. A hotel may take the following preventive measures to minimize late check-outs:\n<br>● Inform the guest about the check-out time and late check-out charges at the time of reservation and also at registration.\n<br>● Have the information regarding the check-out timings printed on the key card and displayed at the back of the room doors.\n<br>● Add the late check-out charges to the guest bill.\n<br>● Request the guests to vacate the room as per the check-out time and offer to keep their luggage in the left luggage room at no extra cost.\n<br>● In case of groups, provide hospitality rooms without any extra charges.\n<br>\n<br><b>Long Queues at the Cashier\n</b><br>The standard check-out procedure, involving a number of steps dealing with the presentation and settlement of bills, takes some time. As more and more guests now want a speedy and queue-free check-out, hotels are coming up with alternatives to the standard check-out. These alternative methods are express check-out and self check-out terminals.\n<br><br><b>Express Check-out (ECO)</b> The front desk is flooded with check-out requests at the hotel check-out time. As the preparation and settlement of bills is a time-consuming process, it leads to the formation of a long queue at the front office cashier's desk. To avoid this situation, some hotels have developed a speedier check-out procedure known as express check-out.\n<br>The express check-out procedure requires the guest to fill the express check-out (ECO) form and a pre-departure folio. The ECO form is an authorization by the guest to the hotel authorities to charge the outstanding balance to his credit card. By signing the ECO form, the guest agrees to pay the amount finalized by the front desk cashier after his departure. These forms are available at the front desk or are sent to the guest on the morning of the date of departure. The ECO form is accompanied by a copy of the guest's folio, indicating the approximate total bill.\n<br>By signing the ECO, the guest transfers his outstanding folio balance to the credit card voucher (created at the time of registration). Some hotels have the policy to take the imprint of the credit cards of the guest to avoid any problems or disputes in the future. In case the final amount varies considerably from the approximate total amount—due to the use of any chargeable facility by the guest after signing the ECO form—the guest may be informed about the same. The variance may also be there in case of any late charges received by the front desk cashier. After signing the ECO form, the guest can leave the hotel at his convenience without having to go to the front desk or cashier’s desk for the standard check-out procedure.\n<br>Once the guest has departed from the hotel, the front desk cashier finalizes his account, including any late charges, and completes the imprinted credit card voucher. The guest’s signature on the ECO form replaces the signature on the credit card voucher as the guest’s agreement to make the payment. The hotel sends the signed ECO and the filled imprint to the credit card company for the settlement of the final bill and mails a copy of the bill to the guest’s mailing address.\n<br>The express check-out service reduces the pressure at the cashier’s desk. It also enables guests to avoid long queues and wailing time at the cashier’s desk during peak check-out times and leave at their convenience.\n<br>\n<br><b>Self Check-out</b> Only fully automated hotels are equipped with self-service terminals, which allow guests to check-in/check-out promptly by operating these interactive machines. They are available with options like check-out only, check-in/check-out, and also cash acceptor. Generally located in the hotel lobby, the self check-out terminals are interfaced with the property management system (PMs) of the hotel. They are also designed to be compatible with a system that allows air travelers to print boarding passes while checking out of the hotel.\n<br>Self-check-in and check-out kiosks identify guests by their rooms’ card keys or their credit cards, as in some cases the guests’ credit cards may be coded like their room keys. At self check-out terminals, guests can access and review their folios and settle their accounts using credit cards. The check-out is completed when the guest's outstanding balance is posted to his credit card account. The terminal dispenses a printed statement of the account settlement. Simultaneously, the system communicates the room status to the front desk computer. The front office module of the PMS automatically updates the room status and other records like guest history cards. The self check-out terminals have the following benefits:\n<br>\n<br>● They minimize the guests’ waiting time as the guests can check-out themselves by operating the check-out kiosk and can settle their outstanding bills through credit card without having to go to the front desk cashier.\n<br>● They simplify the check-in and check-out procedure as the guests can easily follow the interactive instructions on the screen.\n<br>● They eliminate the scope of human error as they are integrated with the hotel PMS and thus track all the financial transactions between a guest and the hotel’s points of sale and other sections.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Improper Posting of Charges\n</b><br>There are occasions when a guest’s financial transactions are not properly posted in the guest folio and the final bill is inaccurate. This might be due to human error or system error. The front desk is flooded with check-out requests at peak check- out times and the cashier might make some mistake in the posting of charges or the calculation of bills. This could lead to a dispute with the guest and delay other guests in the queue. The whole experience can be quite damaging for the hotel.  To avoid this, hotels should install guest accounting systems, which are more accurate and faster, leading to higher guest satisfaction.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

There are several acceptable modes of payment—foreign currency, traveler’s cheque, demand draft, debit card, credit card, and so on.\n<br>\n<br><b>Foreign Exchange\n</b><br>The tourism and hospitality industry is among the major foreign exchange earners for any nation, All the foreign visitors in a hotel can settle their accounts in the currency of their country dollar, Euro, Pound, etc. except guests who are employed with the UN and its agencies, embassies, consulates, and high commissions. Even if the guests have already converted their currency into Indian currency, they still have to pay the room rent in foreign currency.\n<br>Hotels have to take a valid license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with foreign exchange. RBI issues two types of licenses to deal with foreign exchange-—-one for the purchase and one for the sale of the foreign currency. A hotel with the purchase license can only purchase foreign currency, which means that the hotel can accept foreign currency from the guest, but the refund amount exceeding the billing amount will only be made in Indian currency. Hotels generally\n<br>obtain the purchase license; but if a hotel has obtained the license for buying and selling foreign currency, it can buy and sell foreign currency, i-e., accept foreign currency and give the balance amount also in foreign currency.\n<br><br><b>Currency Exchange Procedure</b> To deal in foreign exchange, a hotel has to take a valid license from RBI. The front office cashier is the hotel’s authorized representative for foreign exchange dealing. When guests wish to exchange the currency of their country into Indian currency, the following procedure is followed:\n<br>\n<br>1. The guest contacts the front desk cashier for foreign exchange.\n<br>2. The cashier requests the guest to produce his passport to verify his identity.\n<br>3. The cashier asks the guest for the amount of foreign currency to be exchanged and determines whether the amount is exchangeable as per the RBI guidelines.\n<br>4. The cashier checks the exchange rate from RBI or a leading nationalized bank of the town.\n<br>5. The cashier prepares the currency exchange certificate.\n<br>6. The cashier requests the guest to sign the currency exchange certificate.\n<br>7. The guest gives the foreign currency to the cashier in cash or as a traveler’s cheque.\n<br>8. The cashier calculates the total amount to be paid in local currency as per the exchange rate.\n<br>9. The cashier dispenses the amount to the guest along with the original currency encashment certificate. He attaches the second copy with the foreign currency or traveler’s cheques and leaves the stationary copy in the booklet.\n<br>10. The cashier fills the details of the daily currency exchange transactions in the foreign currency control sheet.\n<br>11. If the cashier receives the foreign currency at the time of settlement of bis the same procedure is applied, and the balance, if any, is returned to the guest in local currency.\n<br>\n<br>The above-mentioned procedure is followed by hotels with the license for purchasing foreign currency. In case the hotel also has the license to sell foreign currency, then in step 11, the cashier returns the balance amount in the foreign currency.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

At the time of settlement, the cashier zeroes the balance in the guest account. If there is a credit balance in the guest folio, the hotel will pay back the balance amount to the guest to make the balance zero. Whereas, if there is a debit balance in the guest’s folio, the hotel will collect the balance amount from the guest to make the folio balance zero. The various modes of account settlement by cash: \n<br>● Currency Notes \n<br>1. Foreign Currency \n<br>2. Local Currency \n<br>● Traveler’s Cheque \n<br>● Personal Cheque \n<br>● Demand Draft \n<br>● Debit Card \n<br>\n<br><b>Currency Notes</b> Guests can settle their accounts by paying through currency notes. This is one of the most widely accepted modes of account settlement. While accepting currency notes, the cashier should check if the currency notes are genuine. \n<br>The following procedure is generally adopted for accepting cash payments: \n<br>● If accepting foreign currency from the guest, the cashier checks the daily currency conversion rate. \n<br>● To avoid any disputes, the cashier should retain the cash amount outside the cash drawer till the transaction is completed. \n<br>● The cashier should count the value of the currency in front of the guest. \n<br>● If accepting foreign currency from the guest, the cashier makes the currency encashment certificate. \n<br>● The cashier issues a receipt for the transaction. \n<br>● As per Government regulations, the cashier should accept foreign currency only from foreigners and return the balance amount, if any, in local currency. \n<br>\n<br><b>Traveller's Cheque</b> A traveler’s cheque or TC is an internationally accepted cheque for a sum in a specific currency that can be exchanged elsewhere for local currency or goods. It is also among the most widely accepted modes of account settlement. Issued by a financial institution, it functions as cash but is protected against loss or theft. The value of the traveler’s cheque is written on it. Traveler’s cheques are useful when traveling, especially in the case of overseas travel when all the credit and debit cards are not accepted. When a person exchanges traveler’s cheques for cash, she usually incurs a charge or commission, though some banks wave off this charge. \n<br>\n<br>The purchaser of the traveler’s cheque puts two signatures—one in front of the issuing authority and the second in front of the encashing authority. To prevent misuse, the loss of a traveler’s cheque should be immediately reported to the issuing bank and local police authority. \n<br>\n<br>While accepting a traveler’s cheque from a guest for the settlement of bills, the front desk cashier should proceed as follows: \n<br>● Ensure that the second signature is put in front of him. \n<br>● Check the guest’s passport to establish identity. \n<br>● Note down the passport number at the back of the traveler’s cheque. \n<br>● If the traveler’s cheque is in foreign currency, calculate the correct exchange value as per the daily rate. \n<br>● Return the balance to the guest in local currency. \n<br>\n<br><b>Personal Cheque</b> Personal cheques are cheques drawn against funds deposited in an individual’s bank account. It takes some time before the payment for the cheque is received from the issuing bank. There is also a chance of the bank refusing a payment—if there is an insufficient amount in the account or if the guest has ‘stopped’ the cheque. Hence, it is normally not an accepted mode of account settlement. However, hotels may accept personal cheques from frequent guests or guests from companies that give a high volume of business to the hotel. \n<br>In case a guest insists on settling his bill by personal cheque, the front desk agent may politely request him to get authorization from the lobby manager. On receiving authorization from the lobby manager, the guest has to submit an application for making payment by personal cheque. The front office agent needs to check the following details: \n<br>\n<br>● The signatures in the application form and the cheque match. \n<br>● The cheque is crossed as ‘A/c Payee only. \n<br>● The amount in figures and words is the same. \n<br>● The date on the cheque is valid. \n<br>● Accept only MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Reader) cheques. \n<br>● Do not accept second or third party cheques. \n<br>\n<br><b>Demand Draft </b>A demand draft is a written order from the bank for the payment of money upon presentation of the same. A person may obtain a demand draft from a bank by filling the required form and paying the draft amount and the bank's commission. It is a secure and widely accepted mode of payment. <br>\n<br><b>Debit Card</b> A debit card is a card (usually plastic) that allows customers to access their funds immediately, electronically. It enables the holder to withdraw money or to have the cost of purchases charged directly to her bank account without paying by cash or writing a cheque. In many countries, it also acts as an ATM card, which is used to withdraw money from ATMs (automated teller machines). It is a safe mode of account settlement as the amount is instantly transferred to the hotel’s account. When the card is swiped, the electronic fund transfer point of sale (EFTPOS) terminal contacts the computer network of the bank to verify and authorize the transaction. Once the authorization is received from the bank, the amount is debited from the guest’s bank account and instantly credited to the hotel’s bank account. In case of insufficient funds, the bank does not authorize the transaction and the guest has requested an alternative mode of payment. \n<br>\n<br><b>Credit Settlement \n</b><br>A credit settlement is an arrangement for the deferred payment of goods and services, i.e., a settlement in which the hotel does not receive any payment on the day of departure of the guest but would receive it later. The various credit modes <br>\n<br>1. Credit Card/Charge \n<br>2. Travel Agent Voucher \n<br>3. Corporate Billing/Bill to Company (BTC) Letter \n<br>\n<br><b>Credit Card/Charge Card Payments</b> A credit card is a payment card (usually plastic) that allows the owner to obtain goods and services on credit terms, without paying cash. It may be used repeatedly to borrow money or buy goods and services on credit. In addition to obtaining goods, credit cards can also be used to obtain cash. The issuer (bank) assures the seller (hotel) that the owner (guest) has a satisfactory credit rating and that the bank will see to it that the hotel receives payment for the merchandise delivered. Transactions during a month are totaled and presented to the cardholder for settlement on a monthly basis. Alternatively, a percentage of the outstanding amount can be paid and the balance extended to the next month and so on. This will normally incur a much higher annual rate of interest than usual; for example, a 2 percent monthly interest rate is equivalent to the annual percentage rate of 26.82 percent. \n<br>It is among the most favored modes of account settlement. It is much more convenient for the traveler to carry credit card(s) than carrying cash. Most of the hotels accept major credit cards. \n<br>\n<br>A <i>charge card</i> is a plastic payment card that enables the holder to obtain goods and services without the requirement to pay cash. The account statement is sent to the cardholder every month and must be settled in full. Unlike a credit card, the balance in the charge card account cannot be rolled over from one billing to the next. In addition to obtaining goods, the charge card can be used to obtain cash. Some examples of charge cards are American Express, Diners Club, and a number \n<br>of gold cards. While processing payment through credit cards, the front desk cashier follows \n<br>the following procedure: \n<br>● Checks the card holder's name on the card. \n<br>● Checks the expiry date of the card. \n<br>● Checks if the card is a stolen card. \n<br>● Checks the credit limit of the card; if the amount of the bill exceeds the limit of the credit card, the cashier requests the guest to pay the balance amount by cash. \n<br>● Swipes the card through the EFTPOS terminal for verification and authorization from the issuer of the credit card. \n<br>● Asks the guest to sign on the transaction slip. \n<br>● Verifies the guest’s signature on the transaction slip with the signature on the signature panel at the reverse of the card. \n<br>● Returns the credit card and the carbon copy of the transaction slip to the guest. \n<br>● Follows the standard operation procedure to process the payment of the guest folio as per the house customs. \n<br>\n<br><b>Travel Agent Vouchers</b> Tour operators and travel agencies selling packages or customized tours make bookings for a guest’s accommodation, food and beverage, and other services. Mostly, they receive the advance payment from travelers at the time of selling the tour package itself. The travel agency (TA) sends a voucher to the service provider (hotel) with the details of the billing procedure \n<br>(direct payment by the guest or bill to TA) and the services (room and meal plan) to be provided to the traveler. Apart from travel agencies and tour operators, airlines (that have contracts with hotels) also send meals and accommodation orders (MAO) or passenger service orders (PSO) to layover passengers in case of flight delays and cancellations. In such cases, the hotel obtains payments from the TA or the airline. \n<br>While processing the TA voucher/MAO/PSO, the front desk cashier should proceed as follows: \n<br>● Read the vouchers carefully. \n<br>● Refer to the list of approved TAs to whom the hotel offers credit. \n<br>● Check the billing instructions carefully. \n<br>● In the case of a foreign travel agency’s voucher, get authorization from the lobby manager. \n<br>● Check the expenses covered by the voucher. \n<br>● Collect payment from the guest for the services not covered or included in the voucher; for example, bills for spa treatments. \n<br>● Attach all the vouchers signed by the guest with the master bill, and ask the guest to verify and sign the bill. \n<br>● Do not give the copies of signed bills to the guest (as these have to be presented to the travel agent, who will make the payment to the hotel in this case). \n<br>● Send the guest bill and vouchers to the accounts department for the collection of the amount from the travel agent. \n<br>\n<br><b>Corporate Billing or Bill to Company lette</b>r Some companies, whose executives travel at the expense of the company, make a deal with hotels, whereby they determine the rates for different types of rooms and meal plans to be offered to their executives. The terms and conditions of the payment are also pre-determined. \n<br>The reservations are made by the company on behalf of the traveling executives. The executives carry a letter from their company, which is called a bill to company (BTC) letter, as proof of their identity. \n<br>The front desk cashier proceeds as follows while processing BTC letters: \n<br>● Establishes the identity of the guest by asking him to show his identity card or/and the BTC letter, which is prepared on the company letterhead. \n<br>● Checks and verifies that the company is listed in the company volume guarantee rate (CVGR) list of the hotel. \n<br>● Checks the services that are included in the agreement with the company any service or facility utilized by the guest that is not covered by the company should be charged separately from the guest. \n<br>● Prepares the guest bill, along with all the supporting vouchers, and asks the guest to verify and sign the bill. \n<br>● Do not give the bill to the guest (as these have to be given to the company, which will make the payment to the hotel). \n<br>● Sends the duly signed bill to the accounts department for collection from the company. \n<br>● Sometimes guests utilize facilities and services, like telephone, laundry, and drinks, that are not covered by the TA voucher or company agreement. In such cases, the guests should settle these sundry transactions by making direct payment to the hotel.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

However, the process also necessitates that specific measures be taken by various departments of a hotel at different phases of the guest cycle. A credit manager cannot fulfill his or her role unless all hotel staff cooperates and perform their own credit control duties.\n<br>\n<br><b>Why is Credit Control Necessary?\n</b><br>Hotels, like any other businesses, need to have a healthy cash flow to survive and succeed and try to achieve this by exercising control over the credit given to guests. The cash flow of a hotel is the money that moves in and out of the business.\n<br>\n<br><b>Objectives of Credit Control Measures:</b>\n<br>\n<br>The main objectives of credit control measures are:\n<br><b>To prevent walkout (skips):</b> Walkouts are guests who leave a hotel without settling their accounts. They include guests who deliberately intend to leave the hotel without paying their accounts as well as those who do not realize that they have to check out with the cashier. This is because they know that their companies have agreed to settle their accounts.\n<br><b>To reduce the problems caused by walk-out</b> guests as well as the lost revenue, they cause a great deal of inconvenience to a variety of people, such as the cashier, who will not have verification of bills, the housekeeper, who will not know the room status, the management, who may decide to instigate legal proceedings, and the police, who would have to alert other properties in their search for the guest.\n<br><b>To prevent late settlement</b> <b>of accounts</b> Since most accounts are settled by the guests on departure, there are few problems of late settlement for these accounts. But corporate or travel agent accounts are sent to the companies or travel agents after the guests have departed. While hotels usually expect that a cheque for settlement should be received within 30 days, in some cases they may have to wait a long time before a cheque is actually received. In some instances, the agent or company may go out of business before settling the invoice, in which case the hotel does not receive any payment.\n<br>\n<br>Delay in payments can cause cash flow problems for a hotel. When companies or travel agents take time to settle their accounts, the threat of bad debt should be considered. Bad debts are incurred when a debtor (a person who owes the hotel money) does not settle the account. Therefore, the account has to be written off, resulting in lost revenue to the hotel. It is, therefore, important that the accountant carefully checks the debtor’s collection period, and any accounts which have not been paid within a certain time period must be followed up.\n<br>\n<br><b>To avoid guests’ dissatisfaction</b> Guests feel embarrassed and annoyed if, on checking out, they discover that they cannot satisfactorily settle their accounts for reasons such as a credit card not being accepted by the hotel, possession of insufficient cash to pay at the account, refusal by the hotel to accept certain foreign currency, or their account balance is over the hotel’s house limit. The credit card organization refuses to approve a charge if the guest has crossed the floor limit.\n<br>\n<br>Many of the possible causes for skippers, late payments, and guests’ dissatisfaction when settling their accounts are the responsibility of the front office cashier and accounts department. Common causes for these problems may include:\n<br>● unclear instructions to the guest at check-in (e.g. not informing the guest which credit card or foreign currency is or is not acceptable.)\n<br>● lack of communication between departments (e.g. the credit manager not notifying the cashier when a guests’ account is over the hotel’s credit limit.)\n<br>● Breakdown in front office procedures (e.g. the front desk or reservations clerk not checking the blacklist for previous walkouts)\n<br>\n<br>Various procedures are necessary to ensure that these problems are minimized, and can include the following;\n<br>● Give the guest clear instructions at check-in regarding account settlement.\n<br>● Notify the guest when their account has reached the hotel’s credit limit.\n<br>● Provide a list of previous skips to all relevant departments.\n<br>● Ensure good coordination and communication between all departments on matters relating to guests’ charges.\n<br>● Ensure that guests with company accounts have been notified that the account has to be verified and signed before check out.\n<br>Non settlement and delayed payment of accounts seriously hampers the cash flow of a hotel. However, most of these problems can be avoided or minimized if credit control policies are set up by a hotel, and if all the staff concerned takes great care in following credit control procedures.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hotel Credit Control Policy:\n</b><br>\n<br>The hotel will normally allow guests to charge their hotel expenses to their room account. To ensure that the final settlement is paid, hotels must be certain that the guests can pay their bills in full before they are given credit. The credit limit (sometimes called the house limit) refers to the maximum level to which a guest’s bill can amount before some form of settlement is required. Credit limits may vary, and often depend on the guest’s reservation status and the method of payment.\n<br>In general, hotels tend to allow credit to three types of the guest (although this depends very much on a hotels’ policy):\n<br>● those who have guaranteed bookings with the hotel\n<br>● those whose accounts will be settled by their companies\n<br>● those who will settle their accounts by credit cards.\n<br>\n<br><b>Guests with guaranteed bookings:\n</b><br>Most hotels give credit to guests who have guaranteed their bookings (either by a credit card or a deposit). These guests are allowed to enjoy the hotel facilities and services on credit and to settle their accounts personally at check out.\n<br>On the other hand, walk-in guests and guests with non-guaranteed bookings or late bookings are usually not given any credit if they settle their bills by cash. They are usually required to prepay their room rate, together with a deposit for incidental expenses, at check-in. If a walk-in guest pays an advance deposit or gives a credit card for the imprint to cover accommodation and incidental expenses, then credit status may be allowed.\n<br>\n<br><b>Settlement by corporate accounts:</b>\n<br>When a company wishes to have credit facilities at a particular hotel, the hotel will have to check to ensure that the company is solvent, ie., that it is capable of paying its accounts. The hotel will need a reference from the company’s bank; if the reference is favorable, the company is approved to receive services on credit. The company will then be listed on the list of credit approved companies prepared by the accounts department. This list will be distributed to the reservations department, reception, and sales office so that other sections or departments can know clearly which companies are entitled to credits at the hotel. However, a hotel often approves different credit limits for different companies. For example:\n<br>A large local firm that regularly reserves a large number of rooms at the hotel and which has a good record of settling bills promptly will have a high credit rating. It may be allowed to have a large balance outstanding on individual accounts and the company’s total account before payment is asked for.\n<br>A new company, a small company, or a company that has been late in settling its account may be given a low credit rating. The company will be required to settle the bill once the account has reached a certain limit.\n<br>\n<br><b>Accounts Settled by Credit Card:\n</b><br>In most hotels, credit is also given to guests who settle their accounts by credit cards that are accepted by the hotel.\n<br>To ensure that guests and hotel personnel are aware of which credit cards can be used, signs are displayed at the front desk and relevant payment areas, showing which credit cards are accepted. This policy can be emphasized to hotel personnel during training sessions and their induction programs, to ensure that guests are not embarrassed at check out. It is important that they and all hotel personnel are fully aware of which cards are accepted. Credit cards may have different floor limits agreed by the card-issuing company.\n<br>\n<br><b>Credit Control Measures During Occupancy:\n</b><br>Most transactions between a guest and a hotel take place during a guest’s occupancy. Therefore, during this phase of a guest’s stay, the hotel needs to monitor the credit given to guests very closely. This is achieved by monitoring bills with high balances.\n<br>The cashier will monitor all the bill totals against the hotel’s set credit limit. Each day, a high-balance report will be produced which lists all the accounts whose totals are near to or in excess of the limit.\n<br>The reception, night auditor, or credit manager is usually responsible for handling accounts with high balances. The guests will be asked to settle their account to date, and a new account will be started for the rest of their stay. The credit manager will send the bill, together with an accompanying letter, to the guest’s room, asking the guest to settle the account with the reception. If the guest has any queries about their account or the credit policy, the reception or the Assistant Manager should explain them to the guest.\n<br>Sometimes, guests may fail to call at the reception desk as requested. In this case, the Assistant Manager has to contact the guest personally. They may telephone the guest in their room, or contact them when they next collect their keys from the front desk. In serious cases, where the guest cannot be reached and has not attempted to see management or the front desk staff, their room will be double-locked. This means that the guest has to contact the assistant manager before they can be let into their room.\n<br>\n<br><b>Credit Control Measures By Other Sales Departments:\n</b><br>Whenever a guest wants to charge service from a sales outlet to their account, the staff in that outlet must check the credit status of the guest carefully. They must check that:\n<br>● the guest is a resident and/or has an account at the hotel\n<br>● the guest is allowed to charge services to their account.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Remember:\n</i></b><br>● A walk-in may not be allowed to charge services to their account and consequently will have to settle the incidentals by cash or credit card at the sales outlet.\n<br>● If the guest is part of a tour, their package may allow a meal in the hotel but only up to a certain value (e.g.$10.00). Any excess on the bill must be settled at the sales outlet. Often the front desk will issue these guests with vouchers, which the guest will hand to the restaurant captain or head waiter upon entering the hotel restaurant.\n<br>\n<br><b>Credit Control Measures After Guest Departure:\n</b><br>\n<br>Corporate accounts or travel agents’ accounts are not settled at check out. Therefore, after a guests’ departure, these forms of account will be transferred to the city ledger held by the accounts department, which holds an individual account for each company. At the end of each month, the accounts department will send statements of these accounts to the companies for a settlement. It is expected that payment will be made within 30 days.\n<br>However, some companies may be late in setting their accounts. In such cases, follow up measures need to be taken by the accounts department to speed up the payment. An example of the procedure is as follows, however, the time frame may be reduced in many hotels.\n<br>\n<br>1. After having failed to receive a payment within 30 days, telephone the company as a reminder.\n<br>2. After 45 days, write officially to the company, requesting immediate payment.\n<br>3. After 60 days send a strongly worded letter. Possibly threaten legal action.\n<br>4. If nothing has been received after 90 days, proceed with legal action through the hotel’s solicitor. At this point, the hotel accountant may have to consider writing off the bill as a bad debt.\n<br>\n<br><b>Preventing Walk Outs (Skips)</b>\n<br>Because a walkout cost the hotel not only in lost revenue but also in actual food and drink costs, much is done to prevent this type of occurrence. Front office staff should take great care when dealing with newly arrived guests. It may be possible for staff to identify potential walkouts by paying closer attention to the behavior of the guest and to thus take measures to guard against them.\n<br>\n<br><b>On Arrival:\n</b><br>When guests arrive, the bell staff should check the number of bags, and assess their weight. People who intend to walk out sometimes have very little luggage or carry empty suitcases which they will leave behind in the room when they walk out.\n<br>\n<br><b>During the stay\n</b><br>Extravagant purchasing patterns can be a feature of walkouts, so the cashier should monitor the guests’ accounts carefully. A person who intends to walkout is more likely to order expensive meals, and eat and drink from room service. The hotel credit limit can be reached quickly.\n<br>\n<br><b>On the day of departure:\n</b><br>The hall porter may contact a departing guest to request the time to collect the luggage. By doing this, the porter will keep the bags in store until the guest has paid their account. Some hotels have a system of luggage passes. When the guest has checked out with the cashier they are issued a receipt or luggage pass. The guest will then show the receipt to the porter who, knowing that the account has been settled, will release the luggage.\n<br>\n<br><b>CASH CONTROL\n</b><br>\n<br>Internal Control:\n<br>In the hotel industry, the main purpose of internal control is to:\n<br>\n<br>● track transaction documentation,\n<br>● verify account entries and account balances, and\n<br>● to identify vulnerabilities in the accounting system.\n<br>\n<br>The keyword to internal control is auditing, which is the process of verifying front office accounting records for accuracy and completeness.\n<br>\n<br>The front office is responsible for a variety of cash transactions that may affect both guest and non-guest accounts. Proper cash handling procedures and controls must be established, implemented, and enforced. Below are some forms that are of extreme importance to internally control, one of the most vital assets in the hotel i.e. cash:\n<br>\n<br><b>1- Front office cash sheet:\n</b><br>The front office cash sheet lists each cash receipt or disbursement of cash. The information contained on a front office cash sheet is used to reconcile cash on hand at the end of a cashier's shift with the documented transaction that occurred during the same shift. The most common entry on a front office cash sheet is the money collected from departing guests during check-out.\n<br>The front office cash sheet also provides space for itemizing cash disbursements. This may include paid-outs or server’s tips included in the total transaction charge by the guest.\n<br>\n<br><b>2- Cash Bank, House Banks, Float, Impress&nbsp;or Petty Cash:</b>\n<br>Cash Bank is the amount of cash assigned to a cashier so that he/she can handle the various transactions that occur in a particular work shift.\n<br>At the beginning of each shift, all cashiers must sign their cash banks and at the end of the shift, shall deposit all cash, checks, and other negotiable instruments in the general cashier's safe deposit box. Good control procedures require that only the person who signed for the bank have access to it during the shift. Moreover, at the end of each shift, cashiers should watch out for cash discrepancies (i.e. any difference between the front office cash sheet and the actual amounts in their cash drawers). Cash discrepancies might have the form of cash overages or shortages. Lastly, cashiers might come up with the net cash receipt, which is:\n<br>Amount of all cash, cheques, and other negotiable instruments in cashier’s drawer – the amount of the initial cash bank\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Net Cash Receipts are the amount of cash, cheques, and other negotiable items in the cashier’s drawer, minus the amount of the initial cash bank, plus the paid outs.\n<br>An overage occurs when, after the initial bank is removed, the total of the cash, cheques, negotiable, and paid-outs in the cash drawer is greater than the net cash receipts.\n<br>A shortage occurs when the total of the contents of the drawer is less than the net cash receipts.\n<br>Neither an overage nor a shortage is typically considered “good” by front office management when evaluating the job performance of a front office cashier.\n<br>A due back occurs when a cashier pays out more than what he or she receives, in other words, there is not enough cash in the drawer to restore the initial bank. Due backs do not reflect positively or negatively on the cashier’s job performance and may occur when net cash receipts are in or out of balance.\n<br>Each cashier begins the shift of each day with an exact amount of bank and everything in excess of the bank is turned into the accounting office at the close of the day.\n<br>\n<br><b>3- Audit control:\n</b><br>Along with the fact that hotels might employ internal control auditors, at least once a year, (especially for hotels traded in the stock market), they use the services of external certified public accountants responsible for approving hotel's accounts.\n<br>\n<br><b>4- Settlement of Accounts:\n</b><br>One of the responsibilities of front office agents is to settle guest accounts, which means the eventual collection of payment for outstanding account balances (i.e.: bringing account balances to zero). This is usually ensured either by full cash payment, transfer to an approved credit card, special program, or direct billing account.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A transaction, especially a financial one, should be reviewed on a daily basis, as\n<br>guests might depart from the hotel anytime and it may be too late to recover an unpaid bill or a loss due to any mistake in the posting of changes in the guest account. In order to safeguard the interests of the hotel, a systematic examination of the financial transactions Of guests is carried out by competent people at the end of every day. \n<br>\n<br><b>NIGHT AUDIT\n</b><br>According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, audit is ‘an_ official examination of a business and financial records to see that they are true and correct’.\n<br>The main purpose of night auditing is to keep a track of the total revenue generated during the day and to keep the guest accounts correct and up-to-date. This leads to customer satisfaction as the guests are given accurate and up-to-date bills at the time of check-out. The night auditor also verifies the entries posted in non-guest accounts, monitors guest credit limits, balances all accounts, and sorts out any discrepancies in room status.\n<br>\n<br><b>NIGHT AUDITOR\n</b><br>A night auditor is a person who audits the hotel accounts daily at night or at a time when the business is relatively slow. The audit team generally comprises members of the accounts department. The number of people in the audit team depends upon the size, location, and products of the hotel. Since most of the activities of the night auditor are concentrated in the front office, the front office manager (FOM) may provide the necessary inputs for the night audit process. So the members of the\n<br>night audit team generally report to the accounts department as well as the FOM. As a night auditor has to work in the night, the position doesn’t find many takers, so most of the hotels do not have a permanent team of night auditors.\n<br>\n<br><b>Duties and Responsibilities of a Night Auditor\n</b><br>A night auditor performs the following duties and responsibilities:\n<br>● Establishes the end of the day.\n<br>● Ensures the accuracy of front office accounting records and balances them.\n<br>● Reconciles all the financial transactions between a hotel and its guests.\n<br>● Calculates the total revenue generated during the day.\n<br>● Verifies and validates the cashier's posting of charges in the guest accounts.\n<br>● Posts the room charges in the guest folio.\n<br>● Transfers the unpaid guest accounts—i.e., accounts of guests who have left the hotel without settling their bills—to city ledger.\n<br>● Monitors the house limit of guests.\n<br>● Prepares a high balance report of guest accounts that are nearing or have crossed the house limit.\n<br>● Monitors the current status of discounts, meal coupons, and other promotional\nactivities that are carried out by the front desk employees.\n<br>● Prepares reports for the management.\n<br>● Tracks the room occupancy percentage.\n<br>\n<br><b>NIGHT AUDIT PROCESS\n</b><br>The night audit is conducted in every hotel to maintain an accurate and efficient accounting system that keeps proper records of all the transactions. This prevents the loss of revenue as well as leads to higher levels of guest satisfaction (as guests are presented error-free and up-to-date bills). The night audit is conducted on a daily basis as the creditors (hotel guests to whom the hotel extends credit facility) are mostly unknown and if their accounts remain unsettled due to some error in\n<br>bookkeeping, the hotel will lose that revenue. The daily authentication of accounts, by verifying support documents and the posting of charges in the guest accounts, is necessary to prevent any possible loss of revenue. The steps that are commonly involved in night audit process are as under:\n<br>● Establishing the end of the day.\n<br>● Completing outstanding postings and verifying transactions.\n<br>● Reconciling transactions in guest accounts, city accounts, and points of sale.\n<br>● Verifying no-shows.\n<br>● Preparing high balance reports and occupancy reports.\n<br>● Updating the system.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

As hotels remain operational round the clock, it is very necessary to ascertain the time that will be treated as the end of the day and the beginning of a new day in a hotel. This time is generally established by the night auditor. The time when the process of night auditing begins is usually taken to be the end of the day, which means that all transactions that take place after the commencement of the night audit are taken in the next day's business. For example, if a guest checks-in at 11:15 p.m. at a hotel where the night audit begins at 11 p.m. the guest’s account is included in the next day's business. \n<br>\n<br><b>Completing Outstanding Postings and Verifying Transactions \n</b><br>Once the end of the day is established, the first step is to complete the posting of all pending charges (room and tax) in proper account folios. An efficient front office accounting system ensures the prompt posting of the financial transactions as they occur and reach the front desk cash and bills section. The transactions should appear in the guest folio in the order of their occurrence. Let's suppose the charges for a meal that was consumed on Monday are mistakenly posted by a front office cashier in the folio on Tuesday. This can confuse and lead to a problem during the settlement of the account as the guest may have visited some other food outlet on Tuesday. The night auditor posts all outstanding charges properly at the commencement of the night audit process. \n<br>\n<br>The night auditor physically verifies all the financial transactions by cross-examining the account with supporting vouchers like credit vouchers, debit vouchers, visitors paid-out vouchers, allowance vouchers, etc. There might be errors in the posted charges, which should be caught by the night auditor. For example, the front office cashier might have incorrectly posted the room rent as $4,000 instead of Rs 4,000. This would have led to an inaccurate calculation of revenue that day. The night auditor should catch this mistake and correct it, saving the hotel from a lot of embarrassment and from the trouble of amending many records. The night auditors verify the postings in all accounts by going through all the documents carefully. They also validate the discounts given to guests. They \n<br>examine and authenticate all the transactions that involve monetary elements. \n<br>\n<br><b>Reconciling Transactions \n</b><br>The next step is the reconciliation of each financial transaction with the original source documents (generally vouchers). The reconciliation of accounts may be carried out in the following sections: \n<br>● Guest accounts \n<br>● City accounts \n<br>● Points of sale \n<br>\n<br><b>Guest Accounts</b> All the financial transactions that occur between a hotel and its guests are examined by the night audit team. The folio of each guest is matched with the original documents of transactions for the verification of the account. The night auditor also checks for any discrepancy in room status reports of the front office and housekeeping departments. For example, the housekeeping occupancy report may show 104 occupied rooms while the front office occupancy report shows 105 occupied rooms. There is a discrepancy of one room, which means that one room is shown as occupied, though it is ready and could have been sold. \n<br>The reconciliation of charges in guest accounts is done in the following order: \n<br>● Room charges \n<br>● Food and beverage charges \n<br>● Other charges \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Room charges</i></b> The night auditor posts the room rent in the guest folio at the beginning of the night audit process. The basis of posting of the room charges may be as under, depending upon the house customs: \n<br>● Check-in/Check-out basis: It is generally followed in commercial hotels. The tariff cards of such hotels mention the check-in and check-out times (generally 12 noon). \n<br>● Twenty-four-hour basis: It is generally followed by transient hotels where the duration of guest slay is very short. At times it may range from two to four hours for guests who have to catch connecting flights. \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Food and beverage charge</i></b> The food and beverage charges posted in the guest folio by the front desk cashier are verified by the night auditor against the restaurant checks, which bear the guest’s signature as a token of the guest’s acceptance that the services were availed by her and that the amount is correct. Every such entry in the guest folio is reconciled by the night auditor. Complimentary kitchen order tickets (KOTs) are also verified and reconciled by the night auditor. \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Other charges</i></b> The night auditor also reconciles other financial transactions that take place between the hotel and its guests. Transactions like visitors paid-out, miscellaneous expenses, discounts, etc. are verified by night auditors. \n<br>\n<br><b>City Accounts </b>Night auditors also examine the entries in non-resident guest accounts or city accounts. They check these accounts for completeness and accuracy. If any instance of the high outstanding balance is found during the night audit process, the night auditors prepare the report of high balance, which is presented to the management, and the responsibility of collecting payment (part/full) shifts to the accounts department. \n<br>\n<br><b>Points of Sale</b> The cashiers of all the points of sale (POS) prepare a summary sheet of financial transactions that occur at their POS and keep the same in an envelope, along with the second copy of bills. The same envelope, along with the cash and credit transactions, is generally deposited with the cashier at the front desk cash and bills section. The night auditor pulls out all the checks/vouchers( including void checks, paid-outs, allowances, foreign exchange transactions, miscellaneous charge vouchers, etc) of individual POS and reconciles them with the POS cashiers’ sales summary sheets. \n<br>\n<br><b>Verifying No-shows \n</b><br>The night auditor also verifies no shows. Ano show is siltation when a guest with a confirmed reservation does not arrive at the hotel on the date of arrival without any prior intimation about the cancellation. The night auditor verifies all such no shows, and in the case of guaranteed reservations, posts the no show in the guest folios. Usually, hotels charge one nights retention for no shows. The night auditor should verify carefully that the reservation was guaranteed, that guest has not \n<br>registered, and that it was not a duplicate reservation, For example, if there is a no show in the name of John Adam, and a guest called Adam Johns has registered at the hotel, it should be checked if the two are the same. \n<br>\n<br><b>Preparing Reports \n</b><br>The next step in the night audit process is to prepare daily reports for managerial use, which help the management to review the profitability of the hotel operations and plan future goals. In manual systems, this is one of the typical tasks carried out by the night auditor. In fully automated hotels, these reports are automatically prepared by the system. The night auditor generally prepares the following reports for the management: \n<br>\n<br>● High balance report \n<br>● Occupancy reports \n<br>\n<br>High Balance Report A night auditor monitors the credit limit of individual resident guest accounts as well as city accounts. The formula to calculate the outstanding balance is: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Outstanding balance = Previous balance + Debit entries (purchases) — Credit entries (payments) \n</i></b><br>\n<br>The credit limit of a guest account depends upon the credibility of the guest and the floor limit of the guest’s credit card. The night auditor checks every account against the relevant credit limit of that account. A high balance report is made in case the account balance reaches or crosses the house limit. For example, the house limit might be Rs 10,000 and the guest might have paid Rs 7,000 earlier, but the total bill after room rent and meals for four days is coming to Rs 18,500, ie., the outstanding is Rs 9,500, The night auditor generates a high balance report that indicates the guest account has crossed the house limit. On receiving this report, the management may seek a partial or full settlement of the outstanding balance before the guest can avail of further credit facility from the hotel. This protects the hotel from the loss of revenue in case the guest leaves without settling her bills. \n<br>\n<br>Occupancy Reports The night auditor also generates the following occupancy-related reports: \n<br>\n<br>● Occupancy percentage \n<br>● House count \n<br>● Bed occupancy percentage \n<br>● Domestic occupancy percentage \n<br>● Foreigner’s occupancy percentage \n<br>\n<br><b>Occupancy percentage </b>The occupancy percentage is the ratio of the number of rooms sold to the total number of saleable rooms. It determines the level of revenue that will be generated by the hotel and is an indicator of the performance of the hotel. \n<br>The formula to calculate occupancy percentage is as under: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Occupancy percentage</i></b> = Number of rooms sold / Total number of saleable rooms X 100\n<br>\n<br><b>House count</b> The house count is the total number of resident guests present in the hotel. i.e.. the total number of rooms sold. It is used to determine the average room rate per person. The formula to calculate the house count is as under: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>House count</i></b> = House count of previous day brought forward - Today's departures + Today’s arrivals \n<br>\n<br><b>Bed occupancy percentage</b> It is the ratio of the number of beds occupied to the total number of available beds in the property. The formula to calculate bed occupancy percentage is as under: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Bed occupancy percentage</i></b> = Number of beds occupied / Total no. of beds available for guest  X 100\n<br>\n<br><b>Domestic occupancy percentage</b> It is the ratio of the total number of domestic guests to the house count. This is the indicator of the type of clients visiting the hotel. The formula to calculate domestic occupancy percentage is as under: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Domestic occupancy percentage </i></b>= Total number of domestic guests / House count X 100\n<br>\n<br><b>Foreigner’s occupancy percentage</b> It is the ratio of the total number of foreign nationals to the house count. This is an indicator of the type of clients visiting the property. The formula to calculate foreigners’ occupancy percentage is as under: \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Foreigner’s occupancy percentage </i></b>= Total number of foreign guests / House count X 100\n<br>\n<br><br><b>Updating the System </b><br>Once the outstanding charges have been posted and reconciled, no-shows have been verified, and reports and summaries for the management have been prepared, the night auditor updates the system and ends the night audit process. In fully automated hotels, the computerized system automatically carries out system updates. \n<br>Thus, a night auditor establishes the end of the day, takes stock, checks if charges have been posted properly, and reconciles all the financial transactions of the day between a hotel and its guests. The night auditor is also known as the in-house auditor who is responsible for conducting audits and generating reports for the management, which include the high balance report and occupancy percentage reports like house count, bed occupancy percentage, domestic occupancy percentage, and foreigners’ occupancy percentage. The job of a night auditor is a very responsible position and requires basic accounting skills, and computer and hotel management knowledge and background.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Small amounts of the metal in elemental form occur naturally in the earth, but most of the silver we use is extracted from silver ores. Silver is chemically unaffected by pure water, pure air, and a majority of foodstuffs, but gets scratched easily if pure. Silver is used as the plating in electroplated nickel silver, for making cutlery, utensils, vases, and decorative artifacts.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Silver\n</b><br>● Sterling Silver\n<br>● Silver-Plated (EPNS)\n<br><br><b>Sterling Silver\n</b><br>Sterling silver is an alloy containing 92.5 percent silver, and the rest is mainly copper.\n<br>Sterling silver is more expensive than silver-plated alloy and for this reason, is seldom used in hotels.\n<br><b>Silver-Plated (EPNS)\n</b><br>Table silver or ‘silverware’ is usually made of silver-plated alloy by plating ‘blanks’ of nickel silver alloy. ‘Nickel silver’ does not contain any silver at all;It(Nickel Silver) is a term for alloys that look like silver (being white metal) and made of nickel, copper, and often(but not always) brass, along with a few other metals for added strength and shine.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedures\n</b><br>Silver needs to be cleaned and polished on a regular basis. When it gets tarnished, more complex cleaning methods have to be employed.\n<br>\n<br>Following are the cleaning &amp; polishing methods for silver:\n<br>● Regular Cleaning\n<br>● Silver Dip\n<br>● Polivit or Aluminium-Soda method\n<br>● Burnishing Machine\n<br>● Plate-Powder Method\n<br>\n<br><b>I. Regular Cleaning\n</b><br>● Wash the article in a hot solution of synthetic detergent, scrubbing with a piece of cotton cloth.\n<br>● Then rinse in clean boiling water in an enameled tray.\n<br>● A sheet of aluminum and some soda can be placed in the tray.\n<br>● Once the articles are clean, drain the water away and wipe dry while it is still warm, rubbing hard with a lint-free linen cloth or chamois leather.\n<br>\n<br><b>II. Silver-Dip Method\n</b><br>● A silver dip solution is used when tarnished silver is to be cleaned.\n<br>● It is usually a pink colored liquid based on an acid solution of a compound into which the articles are immersed completely for removal of tarnish.\n<br>● The silver should remain in the liquid for a very short time, the articles should be lifted out, washed with warm water and dried.\n<br>● While working with silver dip, stainless steel containers should not be used since the dip attacks steel.\n<br>● Enamel or plastic containers must be used instead.\n<br>● The silver dip should not be used too frequently on the silver, either, since it is harder on silver because of a chemical reaction between the silver and the liquid that can corrode the metal.\n<br>● However, many establishments use silver dip frequently since it is faster than other methods.\n<br>\n<br><b>III. Polivit Method\n</b><br>● Polivit is an aluminium metal sheet containing holes, which is best used in an enamel bowl or galvanized iron bowl.\n<br>● The polivit is placed in the bowl together with some soda.\n<br>● The silver to be cleaned is then put into the bowl, ensuring that at least one piece of silver has contact with the polivit.\n<br>● Sufficient boiling water is poured into the bowl to cover the silver being cleaned has to contact with the polivit.\n<br>● A chemical reaction takes place between the polivit, soda, boiling water, and silver which causes the tarnish to be lifted.\n<br>● After 2-4 minutes, silver should be removed from the bowl and placed into the 2nd bowl of boiling and then rinsed.\n<br>● On removal from the second bowl, the silver is allowed to drain and then polished with a clean cloth and then dried with a tea cloth.\n<br>\n<br><b>IV. Burnishing Machine\n</b><br>● This is a revolving drum with a safety shield. In this revolving drum, highly polished steel balls are immersed in a detergent solution with silver articles.\n<br>● The machine rotates and the friction from the steel balls polishes the silver.\n<br>● These articles are then rinsed into hot water and dried.\n<br>● The burnishing machine is used for polishing large quantities of silver articles.\n<br>● Care should be taken to keep the ball bearings covered with water when not in use since they rust rapidly otherwise.\n<br>\n<br><b>V. Plate-Powder Method\n</b><br>● This pink powder should be mixed with just enough methylated spirits to make a smooth paste.\n<br>● Alternatively, water may be used, but the methylated spirit is preferred since it evaporates faster and the silverware is then available for polishing much more quickly.\n<br>● The smooth paste is rubbed thoroughly onto the silver article with a clean rag and left to dry. It is then rubbed off with rags.\n<br>● The article should now be rinsed well in boiling water and buffed with a clean cloth.\n<br>● Though this method is time-consuming it gives a good result.\n<br>\n<br><b>Steel\n</b><br>Steel is an alloy of iron. The alloy contains mainly iron and carbon; other materials are found in small quantities. It is used in the form of pressed chrome steel for the manufacture of baths, sinks, and so on. Stainless steel is used in making cutlery, protective paneling, sanitary-ware, furniture, trays, and cooking utensils. Steel is sometimes galvanized or enameled to prevent corrosion. If an enameled steel surface gets stained, it can be washed with a mild liquid abrasive.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Types of steel commonly used\n</i></b><br>● Chrome Steel\n<br>● Stainless Steel\n<br>● Galvanized Steel\n<br><br><b>I. Chrome Steel\n</b><br>Steel is coated with chromium for manufacturing taps, bath handles, shower fittings, and so on.\n<br>These can become spotted with watermarks or get greased, but they do not tarnish.\n<br><b>II. Stainless Steel\n</b><br>This is steel to which 8-25 percent of chromium has been added, making it corrosion-resistant.\n<br>Stainless steel is tough, durable, and can take a mirror-polished finish. It is used in making cutlery, sinks, WCs, and so on. For spoons and forks, steel containing 18 percent chromium and 8 percent nickel is generally used.\n<br>However, even stainless steel can be harmed by silver-dip solutions, acidic solutions, salt-vinegar mixtures, and excessive heat.\n<br><b>III. Galvanized Steel\n</b><br>Steel may be coated with zinc (galvanized) to prevent tarnishing. This kind of steel is used for making buckets.\n<br><br><b>Cleaning Procedures\n</b><br><b>Stainless steel </b>is washed in a hot solution of synthetic detergent using a soft nylon scrubber, rinsed with clean water and immediately dried thoroughly with a linen cloth. The use of harsh abrasives should be avoided as they may scratch the surface.\n<br><b>Chrome steel and galvanized steel</b> are wiped or washed with synthetic detergent solution, stains removed with soft steel-wool, the articles rinsed with clean water, and buffed with a linen cloth. For cleaning greasy stains, sodium bicarbonate can be used on all types of steel.\n<br>\n<br><b>Copper\n</b><br>This metal with an orange-brown shade has a light sheen of its own. It is used for wall paneling and countertops in bars and restaurants; bowls, vases, and urns in lobbies and guestrooms; and utensils in the kitchen. Copper is even used in cutlery and serving dishes in some ethnic Indian restaurants. Copper cookware should be lined with tin or nickel for protection, as the copper may react adversely with some foods.\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedure\n</b><br>● Copper is washed in warm water and then rubbed with a mixture of salt, fine sand, and vinegar, using rags, to clean.\n<br>● It is then rinsed in warm water and dried with a smooth cloth.\n<br>● A thin coat of vegetable oil is applied to the surface to retard further tarnish.\n<br>● In the case of heavily tarnished copper, a weak ammonia solution will remove the greenish deposits on the surface.\n<br>\n<br><b>Brass</b>\n<br>This is a golden-brown alloy of copper and zinc. It is used in making door and window fittings, stair rods and railings, foot rails in bars, taps, ashtrays, and ornaments. Brass tarnishes and scratches easily. To avoid this, brass fixtures are usually lacquered.\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedure\n</b><br>● To clean brass articles, remove surface dirt with a duster and rub the article with a paste made of white flour, salt, and vinegar in equal parts. \n<br>● This will remove mild tarnish. Make sure to rub away all the mixture.\n<br>● Corroded brass should be treated with the spirit of salt (hydrochloric acid) and then rinsed thoroughly.\n<br>● Polish with Brasso, using damp rags or cotton\n<br>● A long-term hard-metal polish can also be used on brass.\n<br>\n<br><b>Bronze\n</b><br>This is a brown alloy of copper and tin. It is used primarily in making works of art and medals. It does not tarnish easily.\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedure\n</b><br>● To clean a bronze article, wash well with water and then apply a mixture of one part muriatic acid and two parts water with a piece of flannel.\n<br>● Allow the solution to dry and then polish the bronze well with vegetable oil.\n<br>\n<br><b>Aluminium</b>\n<br>This silvery, lightweight metal is highly malleable and ductile. It is used to make light fittings and other utensils. Aluminium is not tarnished by air. It is, however, damaged by soda and other alkalis as well as stained by acids. It also scratches and bends easily.\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedure\n</b><br>● To clean aluminium, wash in a hot solution of synthetic detergents, using soft steel-wool to scrub.\n<br>● Use mild abrasives only in the case of difficult stains.\n<br>● Discoloration in saucepans can be removed by boiling a solution of water and lemon juice in them, rinsing and then drying.\n<br>● In the case of aluminium showpieces, some liquid wax polish may be applied to maintain the gloss.\n<br>\n<br><b>Iron\n</b><br>This silver-white metal of great strength is used in making furniture, buckets, dustbins, and cookware. Iron can be forged or cast. Wrought iron is iron that has been forged, that is, it has been shaped by heating in fire and then hammering while hot. Cast iron is a hard alloy of iron, carbon, and silicon that has been cast in a mold. Non-enameled cast iron is flame and oven-proof.\n<br><b>Maintenance</b>\n<br>● Utensils made of cast iron need to be seasoned before first use to prevent rusting.\n<br>● Before seasoning, the article has to be washed in mild soap and water, then thoroughly dried.\n<br>● Seasoning is done by rubbing the inside surface with vegetable oil and heating in a slow oven for about two hours.\n<br>● Enameled cast-iron utensils do not need seasoning and are easier to clean.\n<br>● If handled carelessly, however, the enamel may chip away.\n<br>● If the utensils are put under cold water immediately after use, while still hot, the enamel may gain flake off.\n<br>● Therefore, before cleaning, allow the utensil to cool gradually.\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedure</b>\n<br>● Unprotected iron should be washed only when necessary and then thoroughly dried.\n<br>● Galvanized iron needs regular washing and thorough drying.\n<br>● Rust can be removed from galvanized items with fine steel-wool dampened with oxalic acid.\n<br>● Do not store iron in damp areas.\n<br>● Before long-term storage, coat with oil or black lead (graphite)&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The mixture is heated in a furnace above 1300 degrees where it forms molten glass. It is then shaped and cooled slowly in the oven as it passes on a conveyor belt. This process is called annealing. It finds diverse applications in hotels.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Glass\n</b><br>●&nbsp;<b>Lead Crystal Glass:</b> this contains lead oxide which produces a lustrous glass, soft enough to enable the outer surface to be cut away into an attractive design. It is expensive and used in bowls, drinking glasses, vases, etc.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Soda Lime Glass</b>: this contains soda ash &amp; limestone and is much cheaper to produce than lead crystal. It is used for general purpose—bottles, windows, pictures, mirrors, etc.\n<br>● <b>Borosilicate Glass</b>: this contains borax which enables the glass to withstand heat. Used for cookware and is referred to as flameproof glass.\n<br>Silvered glass (for mirror) is made by coating one side of a glass panel with silver, followed by a coat of paint and a layer of stove enamel.\n<br>\n<br>It can be classified according to usage:\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Flat Glass:</b> is a soda-lime glass and used in making large flat panels.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>a) Sheet Glass: </i></b>This needs polishing after annealing. Sheet glass used for windows is made from the soda-lime base. It may be textured so that light passes through but it is not transparent (Obscured glass) It may have incorporated wire in between (Obscured glass with wire).\n<br><b><i>b) Float Glass:</i></b> This type of glass does not require polishing after annealing. It is of better quality and finishes then sheet glass.\n<br>\n<br><b>2.Obscured Glass:</b> It is basically a sheet glass that has a texture on one side so that visibility is restricted but the light passes through. Generally used in bathrooms.\n<br>\n<br><b>3.Fiberglass:</b> It is manufactured in the shape of textile fiber or as sheets of plastic. These can be moulded and are used for sanitary ware, furniture, and wall panels. It is fireproof, impermeable, and resistant to damage by pests, sunlight, and air.\n<br>\n<br><b>4.Hollow Glassware</b>: Made by moulding or blowing hot glass into iron or wood casts. The moulds may have patterns that give the final object various effects.\n<br>\n<br><b>5.Safety Glass:</b> This kind of glass is used in places that require good safety and protection from easy and frequent damage or for security-related applications.\n<br>\n<br>● <b>Obscured glass with wire:</b> Wire is rolled into the obscured glass that holds the pieces as it gets broken.\n<br>● <b>Toughened Glass:</b> It is made by heating the glass to high temperature and then cooling it rapidly. As a result skin forms which if the glass breaks will cause the pieces to shatter into tiny harmless fragments.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Laminated Glass:</b> It consists of a thin sheet of plastic sandwiched between two sheets of glass.\n<br>● <b>Toughened Glass with lamination:</b> Combination of the two glasses above.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Cut Glass: </b>This is made by hand cutting glass articles using abrasive copper wheels that rotate at high speed. Cut glass is polished by treating the glass by acid. The grooves created emit rainbow-colored reflections. This glass is expensive and used for chandeliers, decanters, vases, and quality table glassware.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cleaning\n</b><br><b><i>Flat Glass:</i></b> Dusting should be done daily by a lint-free cloth. Light soiling and greasy marks should be removed using a solution of vinegar and water (1:1). Window squeegee may be used for larger areas and quick cleaning after dipping it in mild detergent solution or glass cleaners. A newspaper ink contains an effective solvent that can be used at last to buff the glass dry.\n<br><b><i><br></i></b><br><b><i>Hollow glassware: </i></b>Textured or engraved glass is cleaned with a nylon brush. Stained vases can be cleaned using a mixture of crushed shells (as an abrasive for textured glassware like wine decanters), synthetic detergent (less alkaline), and warm water. For jars and bottles, a mixture of construction sand and water can also be used to remove discoloration. To remove lime deposits caused due to hard water, soak the article in distilled water for an hour, scrub with a nylon scrubber and synthetic detergent solution and rinse with water.\n<br><b><br></b><br><b><i>Chandeliers:</i></b> Chandeliers are delicate, expensive, and therefore difficult to maintain. Cleaning them is a laborious and time-consuming process. For cleaning, they are brought down and dismantled piece by piece dipped in a warm solution of mild detergent. Each piece is gently scrubbed by a nylon scrubber and rinsed in warm water. The second rinsing is done in a mixture of one teaspoon liquid ammonia in 2.5 liters of water. This results in a brilliant sparkle. An alternate method is to use an upholstery shampooing machine. The machine sprays a detergent solution that cleans glass pieces by pressure and the water is collected in a basin.

The primary consideration for wall covering, though, should be their functional quality. Decorative wall coverings should complement the theme. Decorative wall coverings are chosen when the ability to bring color, texture, light, or shade to the room is of great importance. The functional qualities of wall-coverings are durability, ease of maintenance. Functional wall coverings provide a hygienic surface.\n<br>\n<b><br>Practical considerations</b>\n<br>The following should be kept in mind before applying a wall covering.\n<br>\n<br>● <b><i>Moisture and condensation: –</i></b> A slight dampness may be countered by the usage of anti-condensation paint or by fixing boarding to battens treated with a preservative.\n<br>● <b><i>Noise: –</i></b> sound carried through ceiling or walls may be reduced by insulation boards fixed in the same way as for countering condensation. The denser the material is, the less the sound that gets through. Though loud sounds with vibration are difficult to deal with.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of walls: –\n</b><br>The selection of wall covering has a great deal to do with the type of wall being covered.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. Brick: –</i></b> Make sure that there is no dampness on the wall if brick walls have been left unpainted they can be covered with a clear sealant to prevent them from crumbling or becoming dust traps.\n<br><b><i>2. Old plaster: –</i></b> Plaster is suitable for most wall coverings and paints. However damp plastering will need stripping and renewing after the moisture problem has been treated at the source. If the plaster is uneven or cracked, use wallpaper or other covering materials (rather than a finish) or line the wall lining or ingrain paper before painting or finishing.\n<br><b><i>3. New Plaster: –</i></b> It must be absolutely dry before decorating can begin if it is to be painted before it is absolutely dry (for decorating effects), emulsion paint is better as it is least likely to blister and allows the wall to breathe. Wallpaper is not to be used until the surface is bone dry.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of wall coverings\n</b><br>● Paints\n<br>a) Water-based paints\n<br>b) Solvent-based paints\n<br>● Wallpaper\n<br>● Fabric\n<br>● Plastic\n<br>● Wood\n<br>● Cork\n<br>● Glass\n<br>● Tiles\n<br>● Leather\n<br>● Inorganic wall coverings\n<br>● Metallic wall coverings\n<br>● Fibreglass/Spun glass\n<br>● Acrylic (Corian)\n<br><br><b>Paints: – </b>Paints are a mixture of four important ingredients: pigments, additives, binders and solvents.\n<br>● Pigments render colour and opacity.\n<br>● Additives give special properties such as resistance to rust and fungus.\n<br>● Binders hold the paints together and bind it to the surface for durability.\n<br>● Solvents enable brushing and rolling across a surface.\n<br>\n<br>Paints offer a wide choice of colour, effects and degree of gloss. Paints used on walls are usually for decoration rather than protection. Paints can be easily applied and cleaned too. Depending on the binders or vehicles used, paints can be broadly classified into two classes: water-based paints and solvents based points.\n<br>\n<br><b>Water-based paints:</b> In these types, the contents are mixed with clean water only. The various types are:\n<br><b><i>a. Limewash: –</i></b> These are colour washes based on lime (that is, calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2), inorganic alkalis, fast pigments, and few other additives. Whitewash is a lime wash without pigments. The ingredients of a lime wash are suspended in water prior to application.\n<br><b><i>b. Distemper: –</i></b> This is superior to lime wash and is available in a wide range of colours. It may be defined as water-based paint consisting of whiting (white chalk), some colouring pigment (in case of coloured distemper), and glue mixed in water. It is available in the form of dry powder or a paste.\n<br><b><i>c. Emulsion paint: –</i></b> This type of paint is used as a decorative finish. There are three major types of emulsion paints­:\n<br>\n<br>● Polyvinyl acetate\n<br>● Styrene and\n<br>● Acrylic resin\n<br>\n<br>Acrylic emulsions have good adhesive properties, are washable, and are easy to maintain.\nPremium emulsions are based on pure acrylic latex and latex and high-opacity pigments. Emulsion paints are thinned with water, easy to apply, and dries rapidly (within 2 hours). It is durable and washable. Two coats of emulsion paints are necessary for longevity.\n<br>\n<br><b>Silicate paint: –</b> this consists of a thin suspension of alkali-resistant inorganic pigments and extenders. It is not damaged by the alkali in cement. It is also porous, hence allowing moisture to escape. It may be directly applied on brick, plaster and concrete surfaces after wetting; no primer coat is necessary.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cement paints: – </b>This type of paint consists of white cement, alkali-fast pigments, accelerators and other additives. It is available as a dry powder and can be found in several shades. This is most widely used as an external paint for building exteriors.\n<br>\n<br><b>Solvent-based paints:-</b> These are made up of six main constituents:\n<br>Base, filler or extender, colouring pigments, vehicles or binders, solvent or thinner,  dryer.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Base </i></b>is a metallic oxide in powder form, serving essentially as a pigment and forming the chief ingredients of the paint. The most important purpose of adding this base to the paint is to make an opaque coating to hide the surface to be painted. White lead, red lead, zinc oxide, iron oxide are the bases commonly used.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Filler or extenders </i></b>are cheap pigments added to the paints to reduce its cost. In addition, this substance modifies the weight of the paint and makes it more durable. Commonly used fillers are barium sulphate, lithopone, silica, silicate of magnesia or alumina, gypsum, and charcoal.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Colouring</i></b> <b><i>pigments</i></b> are mixed to the paints to get the desired colour.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Vehicles or binders</i></b> are liquid that acts as a binder for various pigments-bases, extenders and colouring pigments. Refined linseed oil is a commonly used vehicle in oil paints. Oils from soya bean, fish, sunflower seeds and tobacco are also being used as vehicles, in various combinations with or without linseed oil.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Solvent or thinner</i></b>, a liquid that thins the consistency of the paint film in the container and evaporates after the paint after the paint film has been applied so that it may solidify. Turpentine, pure oils, petroleum and spirit are commonly used solvents.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Dryers </i></b>are a group of materials containing metallic compounds that are used in small amounts for accelerating the drying of the paint film. Lead acetate, manganese dioxide and cobalt are commonly used dryers.\n<br>\n<br><b>The different types of solvent based paints are:\n</b><br>● Alkyd paints: – These paints are based on synthetic resins combined with vegetable oil such as linseed oil. These are generally easier to apply and have better durability and wearing properties than older types of paint. They have good opacity and excellent fastness to light as well. They are available in a wide range of colours.\n<br>● Aluminium Paints: –These are used for painting wood and metal surfaces. Aluminium forms the base in this type of paint.  This paint is well established for its good waterproofing and weather-resistant qualities. It is not used for painting large areas of walls. It is commonly used for painting metal roofs, machinery, oil or gas storage tanks etc.\n<br>● Anti-corrosive paints: – these generally used as metal protection paints. Linseed oil is generally used as a vehicle. Sometimes dryers and inert fillers are added to modify the paint to the requirements.\n<br>● Asbestos paints: – this type of paint is especially suitable for patching up or stopping leakage in metal roofs. Asbestos or fibrous coatings are sometimes used as moisture-proof covering coats for the outer face of the basement walls as well.\n<br>● Bituminous paints: – These are alkali resistant and are chiefly used for painting exterior brickwork and plastered surfaces. They are also used for waterproofing and protecting iron and steel, and are commonly applied on structural steelwork that is underwater.\n<br>● Bronze paints: – this type of paint is often used for painting the interior of exterior metallic surfaces. Aluminium bronze, copper bronze and copper powder are the pigments commonly used in this type of paint.\n<br>● Cellulose paints: – This type of paint is made from celluloid sheets and amyl acetate substitutes. For making a superior type of paint, nitro cotton is used. It dries very quickly and possesses the additional advantages of hardness, flexibility and smoothness.\n<br>● Enamel paints: – This type of paint is made by adding white lead or zinc white to a vehicle comprising a varnish. On drying, it forms a smooth, glossy, relatively hard and permanent film. It is commonly used for painting porches, decks, stairs, concrete surfaces and so on.\n<br>● Oil paints: – this type of paint can be used for almost all surfaces, from woodwork to fabrics. Oil paints basically consist of two main components- a base and a vehicle. Oil paints are manufactured in different shades and grades and are very commonly used.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Characteristics of good paint: –\n</i></b><br>the characteristics of good paints are listed below\n<br>\n<br>● It should stick to the surface well and should be able to seal the pores.\n<br>● Its consistency should provide easy work-ability.\n<br>● The paint film should dry rapidly.\n<br>● The thickness of the paint film should be adequate for good protection and decoration of the surface.\n<br>● The dried paint film should be able to withstand the effect of adverse weather for a long time.\n<br>● It should offer resistance to cracking and flaking.\n<br>● It should possess good moisture maintenance.\n<br>● Its colour should not fade with the passage of time.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of paints:-\n</b><br>● Remove light dust with a duster, wall broom or vacuum cleaner attachments.\n<br>● Wash when necessary (washable paints), with warm water and suitable detergent to remove heavily ingrained or tenacious dust or dirt. This is important on low sheen surfaces as dry cleaning tends to force dust into the surface.\n<br>● When washing, start from the bottom and work upward using a sponge or worn distemper brush. Change the solution frequently. Rinse from the top downwards, using frequent changes of water. Sponge dry.\n<br>● Low sheen finishes, especially emulsion paints, may tend to ‘polish up’ if isolated areas of bad soiling are rubbed vigorously with a damp cloth. Clean such areas by very light scrubbing with a damp nail brush.\n<br>● Never apply wax polishes or oil to gloss painted surfaces to revive them. The residue may cause subsequent paint coating to peel, or fail to dry.\n<br>● Do not use harsh abrasives, strong solvents or strong soda solutions to clean paintwork. The film may be damaged or softened.\n<br>\n<br><b>Wallpaper\n</b><br>This type of wall covering evolved as an inexpensive substitute for tapestries of the wealthy. The choice of wallpaper depends upon the dimensions and uses of the room. Wallpapers have a warmer appearance than paint. They can be stuck back even if they are torn. Smooth finishes do not catch dust, but easily show up marks.\n<br>\n<br>The various kinds of wallpaper available are:\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Lining Paper: –</i></b> A preliminary covering of plain paper that gives the wall an even porosity, which helps when painting. On surfaces such as painted walls, this can be essential. There are various grades. It is best to avoid thin papers and use a heavy grade to conceal uneven walls.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Surface-printed papers: –</i></b> The cheaper papers are called the pulp. Higher-quality papers, known as grounded papers, are given a coating of colour before the design is printed on these. Such wallpapers vary in weight and thickness. Thin papers are cheap but tear easily when wet.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Washable papers: –</i></b> A transparent waterproof film stops moisture from damaging design. These are especially suitable for bathrooms and kitchens. They can be easily cleaned with a damp sponge.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Embossed papers: –</i></b> The design is pressed into paper to make it stand out in relief. This process produces wood-like grain, imitation leather, and textile effects. Duplex-embossed papers have designs with more depth since two layers of papers are bound together before the design is impressed.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Metallic papers: –</i></b> these are made from patterned foil glued to a paper backing. Their reflective surface accentuates any unevenness in the walls, however, so they should be used only on a perfectly flat surface.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Hand-printed papers: -</i></b> each roll is prepared separately and therefore costs more than machine-printed paper. The designs are outlined more sharply.\n<br>\n<br>Other variations in wallpaper include Anaglypta, supaglypta, ingrained paper, lincrusta, flock, wood-chip papers, paper-backed hessian, Japanese grasscloth, paper-backed wools, woven grass, felts cork, silk and other textile materials.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of wallpapers: –\n</b><br>● Remove surface dust with a wall broom or vacuum cleaner attachments (low suction fro flocking papers).\n<br>● Remove marks by rubbing with soft rubber or a piece of soft bread. If the paper is sponge able, wipe with a damp cloth or sponge.\n<br>● Attempt to remove grease with a proprietary grease absorber.\n<br>\n<br><b>Fabric wall coverings\n</b><br>These days, wall fabrics fall into two main categories: fabric that actually surfaces a wall like wallpaper and those that are draped loosely across a wall.\n<br>\n<br>Tapestry, canvas, and silk fabrics are most commonly used. Almost any fabric can be used as a wall covering. It should be remembered that wool materials may be attacked by moth and if adequate precautions are not taken.\n<br>\n<br>Wild silk and other beautiful fabrics are often padded for heat and sound insulation, and for effect, they may be stretched taut, gathered, or pleated into a frame. Silk tapestries are expensive wall coverings and thus are more usually found in luxury establishments.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of fabric wall coverings: –\n</b><br>Remove surface dust by brushing or vacuum cleaner attachments.\n<br>For the more beautiful hangings, when necessary, send to a firm of dry cleaners who are specialized in this type of work.\n<br>Where canvas is stuck to the walls, scrub very lightly using warm water and synthetic detergent where necessary.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Plastic\n</b><br>Many types of plastic wall coverings are available now and they are becoming increasingly popular; some are more decorative than others and some afford sound insulation, but all, owing to their abrasion resistance, are more hard wearing and easily cleaned than other wall coverings. As they are nonporous, there is a greater tendency for the growth of moulds so the adhesives should contain fungicides. The main types are as follows: –\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)</i></b> or other synthetic materials bonded to either a paper or fabric backing, e.g. Baladore, Fablon etc.\n<br><b><i>2. Laminated plastic</i></b> produced as surface boards or as a veneer that requires sticking to plywood. Melamine is the resin frequently used during the manufacturing of these plastic laminated which often simulate wood paneling\n<br><b><i>3. Plastic wall</i></b> tiles imitate ceramic tiles\n<br><b><i>4. Vinyl flocked papers</i></b> are velvety piles of the flock, mostly synthetic, stuck in patterns over the background vinyl wallpaper.\n<br>\n<br>Some other types of plastic wall coverings are paper or fabric-backed vinyl, expanded polystyrene, clear acrylic-plastic sheeting etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of plastic wall covering: –\n</b><br>● Remove surface dust with duster, wall broom or vacuum cleaner attachments,\n<br>● Wash, when necessary, with warm water and synthetic detergents.\n<br>\n<br><b>Wood\n</b><br>The wood used for paneling is usually hard, well seasoned, and of a decorative appearance, and they may cover the wall completely or from a dado. Wood paneling may be solid or veneered: it lasts for years providing precautions are taken in respect of dry rot and woodworm but the initial cost is rather high.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of wood: –\n</b><br>● Dust and occasionally polish.\n<br>● Remove old polish periodically using white spirit or vinegar and water and then polish.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cork\n</b><br>This offers dramatic and luxurious effects and is easily installed. Its chief virtue is sound control. Its main disadvantage is its perishability.\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of cork: –\n</b><br>● Brush or vacuum\n<br>● Sponge away any marks gently with lukewarm water and mild detergent.\n<br>● Do not over wet.\n<br>\n<br><b>Glass wall covering\n</b><br>Glass can be used in the form of decorative tiles in the same way as ceramic tiles and these should not be confused with glass bricks which allow the passage and form the wall itself.\n<br>\n<br>Glass as a wall covering is frequently used in the form of mirrors which are plate glass backed with a coating of colored metallic paint, usually silver, and this reflects the light. Mirrors may be above the dado or may cover the whole wall.\n<br>\n<br><b>Care and cleaning of glass: –</b>\n<br>● Dust or wipe with a damp duster or scrim while proprietary cleansers or methylated spirits can be used.\n<br>● When cleaning mirrors, care should be taken to prevent the backs from becoming damp.\n<br>\n<br><b>Fiberglass/spun glass\n</b><br>These wall coverings can be almost indistinguishable from old woodwork or weathered plaster if properly painted. This material can be poured into molds to duplicate just about any shape or surface.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Care and cleaning of fiberglass: –\n</i></b><br>Fiberglass is easy to clean. It requires only dusting or a bit of wiping with a damp cloth.\n<br>\n<br><b>Metallic wall coverings\n</b><br>Metals may be used on walls for their decorative and hygienic qualities. Metal such as copper and anodized Aluminium are decorative and may be used for effect in such areas as bars, where the metal – in combination with rows of bottles and interesting lighting – is most impressive. Other metals, usually stainless steel in the form of tiles, may be used in kitchens, where they present a durable, easily cleaned hygienic surface area. Metal skirting boards provide coved edges between walls and floor surfaces. The metal foils are durable and washable.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Care and cleaning of metallic wall coverings: –\n</i></b><br>● A soft brush is required to clean the indented portions.\n<br>● Daily dusting is required.\n<br>● Wipe with a sponge wrung out in mild detergent, dry with a duster.\n<br>\n<br><b>Tiles</b>\n<br>Long related to an outdoor area or limited to kitchen and bathroom walls, tiles have finally come into their own again, with ceramic and mosaic patterns that brighten and create a cool, airy feeling in the room being most popular. Generally easy to clean, the main drawback of tiles is that the grouting may become discoloured or chipped till tiles loosen.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Care and cleaning of tiles: –\n</i></b><br>● Clean grouting with a soft brush dipped in a bleach solution and rinse.\n<br>● Wipe down with a sponge wrung out in mild detergent solution and rinse well.\n<br>● Dry with a duster\n<br>\n<br><b>Leather\n</b><br>Animal hides are extremely expensive and very decorative. They may be padded and studded with brass studs, and they do not usually cover a complete wall surface. They may be found in luxury establishments in parts of restaurants or bars, but are too expensive to be found in most places. They are also prone to attack by mildew. Nowadays, the effects of leather may be simulated by plastic where required.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Care and cleaning of leather: –\n</i></b><br>● Daily dusting or suction cleaning is required.\n<br>● If soiled, wipe the leather with a soft cloth wrung out of warm water and mild detergents. Then damp dust with clean water.\n<br>● Dry thoroughly.\n<br>● Occasionally leather may be polished with a good furniture polish cream to keep it supple.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Softwood</i> – obtained from coniferous trees like Pine, Fir, Cedar, and Rubber. They are lighter in weight, cheaper, less durable ( more prone to – indentations, grooves, splintering, wear and tear)\n<br><i>b. Hard Wood</i> – obtained from deciduous trees like Teak, Oak, Beech, Birch, Walnut, and Rosewood. They are strong, heavy, and durable. They have a more refined grain and shorter fibers so they do not form splinters or indentations.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Wood Boards </i></b>– cheaper than solid wood, lighter and treated ( e.g. Termite proof, Water Proof)\n<br><i>1. Hardboard—</i>thin flexible board made from compressed and processed wood pulp fiber (manufactured from chips of wood, synthetic resin adhesives, and vinyl fiber). It is smooth on one side &amp; mesh texture on the other. Hard boards are used for backing of pictures, door panels, cupboards, the base of floor tiles, etc.\n<br><i>2. Plywood—</i>is made by bonding together a number of thin sheets of hardwood termed as “plies”. They are strong and therefore used for tables, shelves, cupboards, chairs, etc.\n<br><i>3. Chipboard—</i>is used in wardrobes, drawers, tabletops, etc. it is made by mixing wood chips with a synthetic resin adhesive and then compressed between veneers of hardwood.\n<br><i>4. Block board—</i>consists of strips of wood between plywood veneers. The inner strips can be up to 3mm in thickness making the board strong and durable. It is used for making tabletops and shelves.\n<br>\n<br><b>Protecting wood surface:\n</b><br>This is necessary since wood is porous and absorbs moisture. It tends to get scratched and stained. The different types of protective treatments are –\n<br>\n<br>● Cellulose lacquer: cream or spray polish applied to gloss finish. It should be dusted &amp; wiped with a damp cloth, later dry with a soft cloth. Damaged by heat, water, and solvents. Re-polishing required periodically( once in 1 or 2 years)\n<br>● French-Polish: French polish is produced by rubbing the solution of shellac &amp; methylated spirits. Makes wood more durable. Damaged by heat, water, and solvents. Re-polishing required periodically( once in 1 or 2 years)\n<br>● Oil: Double-boiled linseed oil can be rubbed on the surface. It will help to reduce water absorption. Daily dusting is essential. Occasionally the surface should be rubbed with a mixture of turpentine &amp; linseed oil.\n<br>● Paint: widely used on the wood surface. Gloss paints are tougher and can withstand frequent washing.\n<br>● Resin: resin is extremely tough. It will resist heat, water, solvent &amp; abrasives. Dust should be removed daily.\n<br>● Wax (beeswax): applied to solid wood furniture or floors. The waxed surface should be dusted daily, cleaned each week with cream or liquid polish and when considered should be rubbed with a thin coat of wax &amp; buffed.\n<br><br><b>Cork\n</b><br>Cork surface is extremely porous and can easily crumble, dent, burn, or stain. Cork is used as wall tiles and flooring. Clean with a vacuum cleaner to remove dust from the pores\n<br>\n<br><b>Cane, Wicker, and Bamboo\n</b><br>These are names given to furniture items Bamboo (thick grass), Cane (palm), and wicker (willow shoots). If not stored carefully the surfaces get easily damaged. They are regularly polished/varnished. Daily cleaning of these surfaces can be by simply brushing or using vacuum cleaners. Periodically clean using a solution of washing soda and water ( 1:10) or simply a solution of borax and water in the same ratio.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

All leather comes from the hides of animals. The easily rotted keratin and globular proteins from the outside of the skin are removed by the treatment with alkalis and enzymes (liming) to leave a string net of collagen, the main structural material of the skin. This collagen would itself rot if left to the action of bacteria, but it is tanned. This is a chemical modification which links the collagen molecules together and makes them less easily decomposed by bacteria and less easily penetrated by water.\n<br>\n<br>Leather is this network of fibers and more like a textile than say a plastic sheet. It tends to absorb liquids in the same way as textiles do, and may give trouble with staining. The greatest danger to leather is dry heat and water. Temperature over moderately warm will tend to convert the collagen to much softer proteins resembling gelatin, and irreversible damage takes place. The leather becomes shiny, brittle, and usually darkens and begins to flake away.\n<br>\n<br>Old leather such as found in antique furniture and book bindings may deteriorate in this way with alarming speed, so if the leather gets wet it should not in any circumstances be dried by artificial heating. The best way to avoid penetration by water is to dress the leather with a good wax polish or with saddle soap. Light leathers are usually lubricated with an emulsion of oil (fat liquoring) during manufacturing. But it tends to lose its effectiveness after some time, and waxy material will give the leather new suppleness and also make it less easily wetted.\n<br>\n<br>Liquid waxes are quite suitable but a saddle soap containing 10% soap and 30% wax (carnauba, beeswax or other hard waxes mixed with neatsfoot oil) will give a better result for furniture or automobile upholstery.\n<br>\n<br><b>Stains</b> on leather are difficult to remove without damage to the material itself.\n<br>\n<br><b>Ink and rust</b> may be lightened with a jelly made from sodium citrate (2 and a half ounces to a pint of water) and enough cellulose wallpaper paste to give a suitable consistency to stop the solution from running.\n<br><br><b>Ballpoint pen ink</b> can be removed with alcohol though it may be necessary to go over the area with wax polish (feathered out) to conceal the defaulting effect of spirit.\n<br><br><b>Tar, rubber, fresh paint</b> and similar materials can be removed with white spirit but again the patch needs to be re-polished to restore it to its pristine( perfect) state.\n<br>\n<br><b>Leather, Leatherites, Rexines\n</b><br>For daily &amp; weekly cleaning: dust thoroughly to remove surface dust, paying attention to folds around buttons (of the furniture like a sofa)\n<br>\n<br>● For spring or periodic cleaning:\n<br>● Remove surface dust by using dusters, or an electric vacuum cleaner.\n<br>● If very slightly soiled, wipe the surface with a cloth wrung out of warm soapy water.\n<br>● If dirty, rub with a mixture of oil &amp; vinegar (oil: vinegar: 2:1).\n<br>● If very dirty, wash with warm water. Use a flannelette. Rinse thoroughly &amp; dry. Polish, using a little furniture polish or cream&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Thermosetting Plastic\n<br>2. Thermoplastic.\n<br> \n<br><b>Thermosetting Plastic\n</b><br>These are strong, hard plastics and not softened by heat. These are used to produce plastic laminates. Plastic laminates are made by subjecting layers of paper impregnated with plastic resin to high pressure and temperature.  These are of two types Melamines and Phenolics.\n<br>● Melamines: these are used for tableware, tray, and laminate worktops. Brand names can be: Formica, Laminex\n<br>● Phenolics: these are used for buckets, mugs, telephone, toilet seat, etc. These can be boiled so suited in kitchen or hospitals\n<br><br><b>Thermoplastic\n</b><br>Majority of items in hotels &amp; other institutions fall into this category:\n<br><b><i>● Acetal Resins:</i></b> these resist boiling, chipping &amp; scratching, and are used for knife handles in particular\n<br><b><i>● Acrylics: </i></b>although extremely lightweight &amp; strong they will scratch easily and are damaged by contact with very hot liquids. They are used for furniture &amp; protective panels.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Cellulose Acetate &amp; Nitrate:</i></b> this is pliable plastic used for brush handles, light fittings, lampshades, etc.\n<br>●<b><i> Polyamide:</i></b> this is used for kitchenware, knife handles, brushes (bristles), curtain fitting, abrasive pads, etc. It will withstand sterilization.\n<br><b><i>● Polyester</i></b>: this may be used on its own trays, lampshades, etc. or it may be reinforced with glass fibers and molded into laundry skips, it is also used in the construction of resin seamless floorings.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polyethylene/ Polythene:</i></b> used for plastic bags, squeeze bottles, etc.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polypropylene: </i></b>used for dustbins, buckets, etc. can withstand sterilization.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polystyrene: </i></b>This is found in three forms. The crystal type—is clear, glossy &amp; brittle and used for domestic kitchen utensils &amp; equipment. Toughened varieties—used for refrigerator linings, fan blades, etc. Expanded polystyrene—used as tiles.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polyurethane Foam:</i></b> the rigid fabric used for insulation but it is more frequently found in the manufacture of mattresses, carpet underlays, sponges, mops, as a clear seal for wooden furniture, etc. It gives heat and sound insulation but there is a considerable fire risk. Foam can be treated for fire resistance but it becomes too expensive\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE):</i></b> used in kitchenware and on the base of irons.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC):</i></b> It is used in the form of tiles or sheets. It is used to coat wallpaper, wood products, or as a floor covering to render them washable. In its rigid form, it is used in the curtain tracks, soil, and waste pipes, electrical conduits etc.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Acrylonitrile:</i></b> this plastic is used for tableware &amp; for outer casings of vacuum cleaners, etc.\n<br><br><b><i>Note:-</i></b> Synthetic fibers:- Polyamide, Polyester, and acrylic can be formed into fibers/ long filaments which have great strength, poor absorbency, durable, are easy to clean, and quick to dry. They are used to make carpets, curtains, beddings, uniforms, etc.\n<br> \n<br><b>Maintaining and Care Plastics\n</b><br>● Dusting\n<br>● Light soiling can be removed by wiping with warm synthetic detergent, followed by rinsing, drying &amp; buffing\n<br>● The textured surface may need scrubbing with a soft brush\n<br>● Stains can be removed by rubbing with a clean cloth soaked in methylated spirit\n<br>● Small items may be soaked in hypochlorite bleach\n<br><br><b>Points to be kept in mind:\n</b><br>● Keep away from direct heat or flames\n<br>● Do not use harsh abrasives\n<br>● Do not drag a heavy object over plastic surfaces or chop or cut on them\n<br>● Keep away from strong acid or alkalis\n<br>● Some plastics are damaged if heavy objects are dropped on to them&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Will there be heavy wear?\n<br>2. Is the area subject to moisture?\n<br>3. Does the floor need to be a sound barrier?\n<br>4. How easy is it to clean &amp; maintain?\n<br>5. To what degree does the floor need to be slip-resistant?\n<br>6. Can it cause allergies or asthma?\n<br>7. How durable is the product?\n<br>8. Is it suitable for the subfloor?\n<br> \n<br><b>Subfloor:-\n</b><br>A subfloor is what’s below your flooring material.\n<br> \n<br><b><i>Advantages of subfloor:\n</i></b><br>● Provides drainage abilities.\n<br>● Warms flooring material upto 30%.\n<br>● Protects against moisture seepage.\n<br>● Lengthens the life of new flooring.\n<br>● Increase its feel &amp; quality.\n<br> \n<br>Examples of subfloors:-Plywood, Plank, Oriented Strand Board, Concrete.\n<br><b>1. Plywood: </b> Made from thin sheets of usual pinewood those are glued together, forming 4ft x 8ft sheets.\n<br><b>2. Plank:</b> There are ¾ inch thick x 4 – 8-inch wide southern pine boards which are nailed together.\n<br><b>3. Oriented Strand Board:</b>  It is a bunch of wood chips glued together.\n<br><b>4. Concrete: </b>Consists of slabs of 4 – 6-inch thick concrete pour. It may tend to absorb moisture which might take longer to dry.\n<br><br><b>Classification of Floor Finishes:-</b>\n<br><b>1. HARD</b>\n<br>Cementitious (Terrazzo &amp; Granolithic) \n<br>Stone (Marble. Slate etc) \n<br>Resin \n<br>Bitumastic \n<br>Magnesite \n<br>Wood&nbsp;<br><b>2. SEMI – HARD\n</b><br>Thermoplastic tiles \n<br>Vinyl \n<br>Rubber \n<br>Linoleum \n<br>Cork&nbsp;<br><b>3. SOFT</b>\n<br>Carpets&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>Hard Floors\n</b><br><b><i>Stone\n</i></b><br>Long life and natural in appearance. All stones are heavy and must be put on a concrete subfloor. For e.g.\n<br>●<b> Marble:</b> Composition: Calcite &amp; Calcium Carbonate. Available in a wide range of colors. More porous, soft &amp; chemically sensitive than granite. Harmed by acid including soft drinks. ● Absorbs Oil. Should be sealed with penetrating sealers. Use neutral cleaners. Do not clean at high pressure.\n<br>●<b> Granite</b>: Composition: Quartz &amp; Feldspar. Hardest in nature. Resistant to most chemicals except oil. Sealed with oil-repellent sealers. Do not use hydrofluoric acid. Can be cleaned at high pressure.\n<br>●<b> Slate:</b> Composition: Grains of Mica &amp; Quartz &amp; Chlorite, Hematite &amp; other Minerals. Dense, but soft &amp; easily scratched. Low porosity to oil &amp; other liquids.Has an uneven surface. Sealed with oil repellent sealers. Never cleaned at high pressure.\n<br> \n<br><b>Cementitious\n</b><br>Good for areas that take hard wear &amp; tear as they are resistant to chipping and cracking, scratching, indentations, heat insects, and rot. Used in areas like the basement, garage, utility areas, etc. They are easy to clean but should be polished carefully as polishing can make them too slippery. The cement in these floorings is absorbent hence avoid the use of strong alkali.<br><b>Granolithic Floor\n</b><br>Composed of cement &amp; fine aggregate mortar (being granite clippings).

Shampooing –</i></b> Shampoos can be of two types Liquid and dry foam. Liquid shampoos produce very little foam but tend to leave a residue that traps dirt making it necessary to clean carpets frequently. Dry foam shampoos are also liquid but leave a dry foam on the surface of the carpet after application – hence the name dry foam. The foam loosens and lifts out the dirt, holding it on the surface of the carpet pile until it can be removed by dry suction. Dry foam shampoos contain some solvent in addition to the detergent to assist in the removal of greasy soil. They also take less time to dry\n<br><b><i>2.Hot water extraction:</i></b> done by a hot water extraction machine that injects a non foaming shampoo solution at high pressure through the carpet. Simultaneously it extracts the solution and soil.\n<br><b><i>3. Dry powdering:</i></b> A powder containing absorbents (sawdust), solvents &amp; drying agents is sprinkled on the carpet &amp; left for 15 to 20 minutes. The powder absorbs the grease &amp; dirt &amp; latter vacuum cleaned.\n<br> \n<br><b>Floor care life cycle\n</b><br><b><i>Stripping:</i></b> Removal of all existing finishes &amp; seals. Clean thoroughly &amp; allow to dry.\n<br><b><i>Scrub &amp; Re-coating:</i></b> Consist of top scrubbing &amp; removing any dirt/foreign material &amp; re-applying finish to renew &amp; extend the life of the coating.\n<br><b><i>Restoration: </i></b> Performed when routine maintenance no longer gives the desired level of appearance.\n<br><b><i>Routine Maintenance:</i></b>  Remove dirt, foreign material. Includes daily cleaning. Improved appearance &amp; life is increased may include dry mopping &amp; wet methods.\n<br><b><i>Coating: </i></b>Apply fix, thin uniform coats &amp; give adequate drying time.\n<br> \n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

And equipment. Dust, dirt and foreign matter deposited on a surface are referred to as soil. This may include substances such as sand, mud, pollutants, smoke and fumes brought into the building from outside. Some types of soil, such as sewage, hair, dead skin cells and fibers shed from the clothing are generated by the occupants of a building.\n<br>Cleaning is carried out for the following reasons:\n<br>\n<br><b>Aesthetic Appeal: </b>the environment is made visually attractive and appealing\n<br><b>Hygiene: </b>effective, frequent cleaning controls the growth and reproduction of pathogenic bacteria and other germs\n<br><b>Maintenance: </b>Surfaces and articles, however good in quality, will have a long, functional life only when they are cleaned on a regular basis.\n<br><b>Safety:</b> Cleaning is done for safety against health hazards, and slip hazards.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of soils\n</b><br>soil is the collective term for deposits of dust, dirt, foreign matter, tarnish and stains.\n<br>●<i> Dust:</i> this is composed of loose particles deposited from the air. It contains both organic (human and animal hair, dead skin cells, particles of excreta, pollen from plants and so on) and inorganic (sand, dry earth) matter. Although dust is light, it is heavier that air thus settles readily on any surface.\n<br>●<i> Dirt:</i> this implies dust held together firmly by moisture or grease on rough surfaces.\n<br>●<i> Tarnish:</i> this is a discoloration or deposition on a metal or alloy surface caused by chemical reaction with certain substances found in air, water and foodstuffs. Each metal gets a different type of tarnish when exposed for too long to these substances. For instance, iron gets a reddish-brown rust, copper gets a greenish deposit of verdigris, and silver gets blackened. There are different methods for the removal of tarnish from different metals.\n<br>● Stain: this is a discoloration caused on a hard or soft surface by a substance containing dyes, proteins, acids, or alkalis. Stains are difficult to remove by routine cleaning processes. Any stain must be removed as soon as possible by using powders to absorb it, solvents to dissolve it , or an acidic or alkaline cleaner to neutralize it\n<br>● <i>Foreign Matters:</i> These may be dead flowers, contents of wastepaper baskets and ashtrays, as well as stains from the deposition of foreign substances.\n<br>\n<br><b>Housekeeping Basic Principles of Cleaning:\n</b><br>● All soils should be removed without harming the surface being cleaned or the surrounding surfaces.\n<br>● The surface should be restored to its original state after the cleaning processes.\n<br>● The cleaning process should be efficient, using a minimum of equipment, cleaning agents, labor &amp; time.\n<br>● The simplest cleaning method should be tried first, along with using the mildest cleaning agent.\n<br>● Always use the cleaning methods least harmful to the surface.\n<br>● The cleaning should proceed from high area to low wherever possible.\n<br>● Always start with the cleaner surfaces &amp; then go on to clean the more heavily soiled ones, so as to prevent the spread of soil from dirty to cleaner surfaces.\n<br>● While wet cleaning an area or polishing the floor, the cleaner should walk backward while cleaning in front of him.\n<br>● Use of the suction/vacuum cleaning should be preferred over sweeping wherever possible.\n<br>● Sweeping should be done before dusting, and dusting before suction cleaning.\n<br>● The noise levels while cleaning should be kept as low as possible.\n<br>● Try to remove stains as soon as they occur using the correct methods.\n<br>● The cleaner should take all safety precautions while cleaning.\n<br>● The cleaning agents &amp; equipment should be stacked neatly to one side after each use.\n<br>● The cleaner should start cleaning from the farthest end of an area, working towards the exit.\n<br>● After the cleaning process is over, all equipment should be washed or wiped as applicable, dried, &amp; stored properly.\n<br>● Cleaning agents should be replenished &amp; stored properly.\n<br>● All waste needs to be discarded &amp; the working area should be always left neat &amp; tidy.\n<br>\n<br><b>Hygiene and Safety Factors in cleaning\n</b><br><b><i><br></i></b><br><b><i>Hygiene Factors\n</i></b><br>● Grooming &amp; Personal Hygiene to be maintained\n<br>● Equipment hygiene to be maintained – all types of equipment to be washed, rinsed &amp; dried after use\n<br>● Workplace hygiene – pantry to be kept clean at all times\n<br>● Colour coded dusters to be used\n<br>● WC duster to be kept separately in the chamber maid’s trolley\n<br>● Cleaning solution to be changed frequently while cleaning\n<br>● Use of wringer\n<br>● Brooms should not be used especially in hospitals\n<br>● Cleaning agents to be prepared freshly. Never top up a disinfectant solution. Bacteria will survive a disinfectant, may multiply in solution which has deteriorated. If a solution is stored and used later, it may spread germs rather than kill them\n<br>● Use of sanibins in public area toilets\n<br>● Garbage not be touched a bare hand\n<br>● Telephones need to disinfected\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Safety Factors\n</i></b><br>● Use of protective gears\n<br>● Ladder to be checked off its stability &amp; durability before using\n<br>● Caution board to be used in public areas\n<br>● Appropriate types of equipment to be used while cleaning\n<br>● While lifting heavy items, weight should not fall on the backbone ( bend from the knees and not back)\n<br>● Avoid lifting the heavyweight; help should be taken wherever possible\n<br>● Cleaning agents to be stored in the labeled bottles; instructions should be written on the bottles\n<br>● Proper training to given to cleaners in terms of use of equipment &amp; cleaning agents\n<br>● First aid kit to be maintained and kept available\n<br>● Fire exit should never be blocked by keeping equipment/ furniture in front of it\n<br>● At the time of the fire, elevators should not be used\n<br>● Ensure that the cigarette butts are fully extinguished before they are trashed\n<br>● Dispose off rags after using any solvent as they can increase the risk of fire&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

These include the regular servicing of guestrooms, cleaning of bathrooms and toilets, suction-cleaning of floors and floor coverings, and so on.\n<br>\n<br><b>Weekly Tasks:\n</b><br>These, as the term implies, are routine tasks carried out on a weekly basis. These may include the polishing of metal surfaces, dusting of hard-to-reach areas, and so on.\n<br><br><b>Periodic Tasks:\n</b><br>These are carried out on a monthly, quarterly (every three months), half yearly or annual basis.\n<br>Spring-cleaning is a special type of periodic cleaning.\n<br>Some of the usual periodic tasks in a hotel include the shampooing of carpets, washing of walls, cleaning of chandeliers, and stripping and polishing of floors. The higher the standards required, the greater is the task carried out daily and greater the amount of soiling, the greater will be frequency which is carried out.\n<br>\n<br><b>Organization of Cleaning\n</b><br>For cleaning to be efficient, it must be well organized. Different ways of organizing the cleaning of various areas are outlined below:-\n<br>● Orthodox/conventional/traditional cleaning\n<br>● Block Cleaning\n<br>● Team Cleaning\n<br>● Deep Cleaning and special projects\n<br>● Spring Cleaning\n<br>\n<br><b>Orthodox/Conventional/Traditional Cleaning\n</b><br>In this way of cleaning, a GRA completes all the tasks in one guestroom before going on to the next room in the section allotted to him/her.\n<br>On an average, a GRA may be required to clean 12-20 rooms in an 8-hour workday.\n<br><b>Block Cleaning\n</b><br>In this way of cleaning, the GRA moves from room to room and completes the same task in every room, before returning to begin the cycle again for the next task on the list. This involves ‘blocking’ several rooms at a time to form a ‘room section’ and usually more than one GRA will be at work in the section.\n<br>For instance, one GRA might take all the beds in that particular room section, while another GRA cleans the toilets, and the third GRA dusts and cleans the area, replenishing supplies that are low.\n<br><b>Team Cleaning\n</b><br>In this method, two or more people work together in the same area, either on the same task or on different tasks. To organize the team cleaning of guestrooms, two GRAs may be scheduled to clean 30-35 guestrooms a day.\n<br><b>Deep Cleaning &amp; Special Projects</b>\n<br>Deep cleaning refers to the intensive cleaning schedule in which periodic cleaning tasks are scheduled for monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annual frequencies. Deep cleaning involves some tasks that require the housekeeping department to work in coordination with the maintenance department.\n<br>Many tasks involved in deep cleaning are complicated and time consuming ones, requiring special equipment, techniques, expertise, and group effort. These tasks are usually scheduled as special projects.\n<br>Deep cleaning tasks include the following:\n<br>● Shampooing carpets\n<br>● Vacuum-cleaning upholstery, mattresses, and bed bases.\n<br>● Rotating and turning mattresses\n<br>● Thoroughly cleaning of furniture and polishing of wooden furniture.\n<br>● Stripping, re-sealing, re-polishing, and buffing of floors.\n<br>● Cleaning hard-to-reach areas such as ceilings, top edges of doors, fans, air-conditioning vents, and so on\n<br>● Cleaning ornate lighting fixtures such as chandeliers.\n<br>● Thorough cleaning of walls, windows, and curtain tracks.\n<br>● Cleaning signage boards.\n<br>● Thorough washing of bathroom floors, walls, fixtures, fittings, and shower curtains.\n<br>● Laundering of washable soft furnishings.\n<br>\n<br><b>Spring Cleaning (Special Cleaning)\n</b><br>It involves periodic annual cleaning of hotel guestrooms or other areas, carried out in off-season periods. The term is often used synonymously with deep cleaning. Spring cleaning may involve a complete overhaul of the rooms and is, therefore, scheduled for the off-season or very low-occupancy periods. Spring-cleaning involves many tasks on which the housekeeping department works in close coordination with the maintenance department.\n<br>\n<br>Intensive cleaning tasks may have to be carried out, for which an entire floor of rooms will have to be taken off sale at a time.\n<br>\n<br>● Spring-cleaning tasks may include the following:\n<br>● Removal of all guest supplies, soft furnishing, and carpets from the rooms.\n<br>● Sending launderable articles to the laundry.\n<br>● Polishing wooden furniture, shampooing upholstery, and covering them with dust sheets.\n<br>● Shampooing carpets.\n<br>● Stripping and polishing floors.\n<br>● Cleaning accessories such as lamps, lamp shades, and picture frames.\n<br>● Stripping any wall covering such as paint or wallpaper and repainting the walls.\n<br>● Washing ceilings and walls.\n<br>● Thoroughly cleaning lighting fixtures, air-conditioning vents, and windows.\n<br>● Thoroughly cleaning bathrooms, including walls, floor tiles, fixtures and fittings, and shower curtains.\n<br>● Vacuum-cleaning the mattresses.\n<br>● Airing the room.\n<br>● Restocking guest supplies.\n<br>● Restoring soft furnishing and carpets.\n<br>● Clearing the rooms to the front desk for sale at the end of a thorough clean.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cleaning Procedures/Cleaning Processes\n</b><br>Cleaning processes may be either mechanical or manual. They may involve washing, friction (as in using an abrasive), suction (as in using a vacuum cleaner), or force (as in using pressurized water).\n<br>\n<br>The various types of cleaning processes are summarized below:\n<br>1. Manual Methods &amp; Mechanical Methods\n<br>2. Manual Methods\n<br>\n<br>These do not call for mechanized or electronic equipment. These include:\n<br>● Sweeping\n<br>● Dusting\n<br>● Damp-dusting\n<br>● Dust-Mopping/Dry-Mopping/Mop-Sweeping\n<br>● Spot Mopping\n<br>● Wet-Mopping/Damp-Mopping\n<br>● Spot Cleaning\n<br>\n<br><b>Mechanized Methods\n</b><br>These utilize equipment powered by electricity as well as mechanical gadgets. These include:\n<br>● Suction Cleaning\n<br>● Spray Buffing\n<br>● Polishing\n<br>● Burnishing\n<br>● Scrubbing\n<br>\n<br><b>Design Features that simplify Cleaning\n</b><br>● Smooth textures; straight, neat, and smooth lines; and medium toned colours are some of the design features in a surface that make for easier cleaning.\n<br>● Surfaces with these features collect less dust compared to surfaces with rough textures, intricate raised patterns, and grooves.\n<br>● Medium-toned colours show less dirt than surfaces of darker or lighter shades.\n<br>● Furniture should be so designed that cleaning under and behind them is easy.\n<br>● Furniture on castor wheels and glides are easily movable, making cleaning under and behind them easier.\n<br>● Bed frames should not have a raised edge. Though raised edges help to keep the mattress sunk in place, they may graze the hands of GRAs badly during bed-making.\n<br>● With regard to carpets, the shorter the carpet pile, the easier the cleaning.\n<br>● Upholstery too should have the minimum of decorative features such as buttons, gathers, etc.\n<br>● Surfaces such as solid wood are now being substituted by laminates wherever possible.\n<br>● While solid wood requires regular buffing and polishing, laminates are low-maintenance surfaces.\n<br>● A regular damp-dusting is usually sufficient for laminates. The drawback of laminates is that they lack the richness and elegance of solid wood.\n<br>● Wood-polishes are stain-resistant and long-lasting, and are a boon to housekeepers as wooden surfaces become fairly easy to maintain with the use of these polishes.\n<br>● Another high-maintenance surface that requires constant polishing is brass.\n<br>● Brass becomes easily tarnished, and more so in coastal climates.\n<br>● Laminated brass surfaces are easier to maintain as they do not require regular polishing, and should be preferred in hotels.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Dust being composed of loose particles, is removed comparatively easily by the use of various piece of equipment; dirt, however, owing to it’s adherence to surfaces by means of grease or moisture requires the use of cleaning agents as well as equipment if it is to be removed efficiently; and a knowledge of different types is important so that deterioration of surfaces is prevented.\n<br>\n<br><b>Choice of cleaning agent</b>\n<br>With a variety of cleaning agents in the market, the housekeeper should remember that a great deal of time, effort and money can be wasted by wrong choice as well as possible deterioration of articles and surfaces. Cleaning agents are chemicals and the housekeeper should have some knowledge of cleaning science if they are to be chosen and used correctly. The following points maybe taken into consideration when choosing cleaning agents; -\n<br>● Type of soiling\n<br>● Composition\n<br>● Ease of use\n<br>● Saving of time and labour\n<br>● Possible damage to surface\n<br>● Toxic or irritation to skin\n<br>● Smell\n<br>● Versatility\n<br>● Packaging\n<br>● Storage and deterioration\n<br>● Cost\n<br><i>From the great variety of cleaning agents available, most commonly ones used are: -\n</i><br>● Detergent\n<br>● Scouring liquid / powder\n<br>● WC cleanser\n<br>● Mirror cleanser\n<br>● Furniture polish\n<br>● Air freshener\n<br>\n<br><b>CLASSIFICATION OF CLEANING AGENTS\n</b><br>Cleaning agents are classified according to the principle method by which soil or stains are removed from the surface. This will be determined by their composition. The principle classes are:\n<br>● Water\n<br>● Detergents\n<br>● Abrasives\n<br>● Degreasers\n<br>● Acid cleaners\n<br>● Organic solvents\n<br>● Other cleaning agents\n<br>\n<br><b>1. WATER:\n</b><br>Water is the simplest cleaning agent and some form of dirt will be dissolved by it; but normally it is a poor cleaning agent if used alone. It becomes effective only if used in conjunction with some other agent, e.g. a detergent. Water serves to:\n<br>● Carry the cleaning materials to the soil\n<br>● Suspend the soil\n<br>● Remove the suspended soil from the cleaning site\n<br>● Rinse the detergent solution from the surface\n<br>● Water has poor power of detergency because:\n<br>● It has high surface tension and forms droplets\n<br>● It has little wetting power\n<br>● It is repelled by oil and grease\n<br>● If shaken within oil the emulsion does not prevent formation of large droplets\n<br>● It has low surfactant effect (surface active agent)\n<br><b>Hardness: </b>Hard water contains calcium and magnesium salts which will inhibit cleaning of material in the following ways –\n<br>a. In combination with soap the salts form insoluble scum which reduces the efficiency of the soap and makes rinsing difficult\n<br>b. Calcium combines with fat in the soil to form a soapy substance which adheres strongly to the surface\n<br>c. The calcium and magnesium salts tend to cause flocculation (tendency to cause soil that is suspended in water, to redeposit on the surface being cleaned)\n<br>d. Hardness of water also causes premature aging of fabrics, causes scale and fur to be deposited in machines and pipes.\n<br><b><i>Hard water can be softened by –\n</i></b><br>● Addition of soda\n<br>● Addition of water softener based on Sodium sesquicarbonate\n<br>● Water softening units, e.g. permutit.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. DETERGENT:\n</b><br>Detergents are those cleaning agents, which contain significant quantities of a group of chemicals known as ‘Surfactants’ (chemicals which have water and soil attracting properties). A number of other chemicals are frequently included to produce detergents suitable for a specific use.\n<br>A good detergent should –\n<br>● Reduce the surface tension of water so that the cleaning solution can penetrate the soil\n<br>● Emulsify soil and lift it from the surface\n<br>● Be soluble in cold water\n<br>● Be effective in hard water and a wide range of temperature.\n<br>● Be hard on a surface that has to be cleaned. Clean quickly and with little agitation.\n<br>● Suspend soil in a cleaning solution, and once the soil is removed, to hold it in suspension and not let it redeposit.\n<br>● Rinse easily and leave no streaks or scum\n<br>● Be economical to user\n<br>● Be harmless to the skin and article.\n<br>● Be biodegradable\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical composition of detergent: -</b>\n<br><b><i>1. Surfactants</i></b> are chemicals, whose molecules when dissolved in water possess, water seeking end (hydrophilic) and a water-repelling end (hydrophobic). They may or may not carry the positive and negative electrical charge. The molecules disperse through water and reduce the surface tension of water by overcoming the forces of attraction between the water molecules, thus allowing the water and surfactant molecules to penetrate the soil and surface.\n<br><b><i>2. Builders</i></b> are alkaline chemicals that influence the effectiveness of a cleaning agent in one or both of the following ways -\n<br>a. They sequester (combine with) calcium ions in hard water to form water-soluble salts, thus preventing the adverse effects of calcium.\n<br>b. They enhance the emulsifying by increasing the pH value of the solution and dispersing properties of the detergent\n<br>Builders in general can cause damaging effects on many surfaces, e.g. chrome, aluminum, wool, silk, paint, wood, linoleum. It may constitute up to 30% of heavily built powdered detergents and helps in softening water too.\n<br><b><i>3. Foaming agents</i></b> increase or stabilize the foam formed by a detergent. Foaming can be used to surfactant activity, the level of foam depending on the amount of surfactant active in a cleaning solution, e.g. ethanol amides. Alkaloids derived from coconut oil are frequently used for this purpose. The foam will stick to all non-horizontal surfaces, increasing the contact between the surface and the cleaning chemical.\n<br><b><i>4. Chelating agents</i></b> are relatively complex chemicals, which are included in many liquid detergents to sequester calcium ions. They are also frequently used as a desealer, being a more acceptable alternative to strong acids.\n<br><b><i>5. Suspending agents</i></b> increase the amount of soil that can be held in suspension in the cleaning solution, e.g. sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.\n<br><b><i>7. Bleaches</i></b> will break down with oxidation, those stains that have not been removed from the surface by surfactants or builders. Sodium perborate, oxidizing weak bleach is frequently included in detergents intended for washing textiles.\n<br><b><i>8. Bulking agents</i></b> contribute to the volume of detergent powders, e.g. sodium sulphate.\n<br>Conditioning agents ensure that the granules in the detergent powder are crisp, firm and dry.\n<br>Whiteners cause absolute ultraviolet light to transmit as visible white light.\n<br><b><i>9. Enzymes</i></b> are complex proteins that break down organic substances, e.g. blood stains, food stains, etc. they are effective at 30 to 50 degrees C and are inactivated at temperatures above 60 degrees C.\n<br><b><i>10. Anti Corrosive agents</i></b> inhibit the formation of water films on the surface. Chemical reactions resulting in corrosion are generally dependent on the presence of water, e.g. sodium silicate.\n<br><b><i>11. Perfumes</i> </b>and dyes are included to increase consumer acceptability, but increase the risk of allergic reactions.\n<br><b><i>12. Germicides</i></b> are also added sometimes to prevent growth of bacteria and fungus.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. ABRASIVES\n</b><br>The cleaning action of abrasives depends on the presence of fine particles which when rubbed over a soiled hard surface, dislodges the soil, removes tarnishing and surface scratches from meat surfaces. Abrasives can be divided into –\n<br>● Hard surface cleaners\n<br>● Metal polishes.\n<br>Abrasives depend on their rubbing or scratching action to clean dirt from hard surfaces. The extent to which they will rub or scratch a surface depends on the nature of the abrasive material and on the size and shape of the particles. The use of abrasive will depend on the surface to be cleaned and the type of dirt to be removed. Whenever possible fine abrasives should be preferred to coarser ones. E.g. glass, sand, emery paper, steel wool, nylon pads, powdered pumice, feldspar, calcite, fine ash, precipitated whiting, filtered chalk, jeweler’s rouge (fine abrasive), etc. they are available in natural, liquid, paste or powdered form.\n<br>\n<br><b>TYPES OF ABRASIVES\n</b><br>Based on the scale of hardness for various substances abrasives are classified as;\n<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n<br>Talc, Calcite, Feldspar and Diamond\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Fine Abrasives:\n</i></b><br>These include precipitated whiting (filtered chalk) and jeweler’s rouge (a pink oxide of iron) used for shining silver. They are also constituents of commercial silver polishes.\n<br><b><i>Medium abrasives:</i></b> these include rottenstone, salt, scouring powder and scouring paste. Scouring powders are made up of fine particles of pumice mixed with soap/ detergent, and alkali and a little bleach.\n<br><b><i>Hard / coarse abrasives:</i></b> these include bath bricks, sandpaper, pumice, steel wool, and emery paper.Glass paper, calcite, sandpaper, fine ash, emery powder and paper, jeweler’s rouge, powdered pumice, precipitated whiting (filtered chalk). Ground limestone, sand, steel wool and nylon scourers are some commonly used abrasives.\n<br>Abrasives are usually not used alone in cleaning agents. For example, a cream or paste meant for cleaning utensils contain about 80 % of finely ground limestone, along with other substances such as bleaches, anionic surfactants, alkaline builders, and perfumes.\n<br>\n<br><b>DEGREASING AGENTS\n</b><br>They usually consist of strong alkalis, which can dissolve proteins and emulsify and disperse grease and similar substances. They are based on caustic soda or sodium metasilicate. Sodium carbonate (washing soda) can also be used. They are basically used as stain removers and for clearing blocked drains, cleaning ovens and other industrial equipment. Extreme care should be taken in their use as they have high pH.\n<br>\n<br><b>ACIDS AND TOILET CLEANSERS</b>\n<br>Cleaning agents with acidic properties react with water-soluble chemical deposits to produce water-soluble salts. Acids dissolve metals and are hence used to remove metal stains such as water stains in baths, hard water deposits around taps, tarnish on silver, copper and brass, etc.\n<br>Weak acids include citric acid (lemon juice), acetic acid (vinegar). They are used for removing tarnish from copper and brass and mild water stains in baths. Strong acids are oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid.\n<br>\n<br><b>STORAGE OF CLEANING AGENTS\n</b><br>Cleaning agents with a longer shelf life are usually bought in bulk because of the reduced costs that accrue from the economics of scale. other agents are bought and replenished periodically .storage of cleaning agents is crucial and the various points to be kept in mind .the points are listed below:\n<br>Ensure that the storage racks are strong and with selves. Heavier containers must be kept on the bottom shelf.\n<br>The store should be kept clean and well-ventilated at all times.\n<br>● Ensure that the lids are tightly fitted.\n<br>● When issuing cleaning agents use appropriate dispensers and measuring apparatus.\n<br>● Ensure that no residual deposits of cleaning agents are left around the rims of the containers.\n<br>● Avoid spillage, if a spill occurs, clean it up immediately.\n<br>● Follow a systematic procedure for rotating stocks.\n<br>● Organic solvents, strong reagents, polishes should be kept away from heat sources.\n<br>● Check stock regularly the store should be locked when not in use.\n<br>\n<br><b>Distribution and Controls ; Cleaning Agents\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>Issuing of the cleaning agents can be done in the following ways:\n</i></b><br><b>Requisition\n</b><br>Each peripheral storage area will have a requisition book with forms in triplicate. Every time good are required, the person responsible for the storage area will complete the form and sign it. The top copy of this form will then be taken or sent to the central store prior to the collection time, where it will be checked by the supervisor and the items put together for collection by the cleaner. The second copy will go to the housekeeper responsible for cleaning expenditure. The third copy will remain in the book which is returned with fresh supplies.\n<br>\n<br><b>Full for empty/ new for old\n</b><br>This system is used extensively in smaller establishments. Individual cleaners will take empty containers or old dusters, etc. to the central store and will be given a replacement in return.\n<br>\n<br><b>Topping up\n</b><br>At a fixed time each day or week, the cleaners will take their containers to the main store to be topped up. This avoids the danger of running out of supplies. In some establishments, cleaners will deposit their bucket of cleaning agents in the main store at the end of each day or regular intervals. These will be replenished ready for collection at the start of the next shift.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Electricity makes the motor work and dust is collected by high suction created by the motor and sucked in through the hose and collected in the dust bag inside the machine. Various attachments are used like floor cleaning head, crevice cleaning head, upholstery cleaning head etc for cleaning different areas. Most commonly used vacuum cleaners used for guest rooms.\n<br><br><b><i>b) UPRIGHT VACUUM CLEANER( DRY PICK UP)\n</i></b><br>The main body of the machine lies horizontally on the surface and does not have attachments but has built in hose for cleaning corners and upholstery. Mainly used for large carpeted areas\n<br><br><b><i>c) BACKPACK VACUUM CLEANER/PIGGYBACK VACUUMS/PAPOOSE(DRY PICK UP):-\n</i></b><br>Small lightweight vacuum cleaners which can be strapped at the back and used to clean upholstery, curtains\n<br>\n<b><i><br>e) DUSTTETTES(DRY PICK UP) :-\n</i></b><br>Small lightweight battery operated vacuum cleaners used to vacuum clean upholstery, carpet edges, mattresses, curtain and staircases etc. Can be carried in hand.\n<br>\n<b><i><br>WET PICKUP VACUUM CLEANER :-\n</i></b><br>Picks up wet waste, excess waste water and used to pick up water from the floor after scrubbing. This can also be used to remove excess moisture after shampooing the carpet. The machine has a squeeze head which is used to remove excess water and collected in a tank which is emptied after use.\n<br> \n<b><i><br>LARGE TANK TYPE VACUUM CLEANER( DRY AND WET PICK UP)\n</i></b><br>Also called canister type vacuum cleaners or industrial vacuum cleaners and are used for dry and wet pick up both. Used for cleaning large areas like lobbies, banquet halls etc.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>PILE LIFTER\n</i></b><br>It’s a vacuum cleaner with two motors to make it extremely strong. The pile of the carpet usually flattens in use. Pile lifters groom the pile of the carpet and restore their vertical orientation. It is not used daily. Mainly used before shampooing the carpet.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>h) CENTRALIZED VACUUMING\n</i></b><br>Centralized vacuum cleaning system suction is generated at one point in a building. Soil is removed by suitable nozzles linked by flexible stretchable hoses to vacuum point. It is then conveyed by a network of pipes to a central container. This system is expensive to install and is generally done at the construction stage\n<br>\n<br><b>CARE AND STORAGE OF VACUUM CLEANERS:-\n</b><br>1. Wheels should be oiled regularly\n<br>2. After use, dust bags or tanks should be emptied and cleaned. \n<br>3. Clean attachment heads after cleaning work is done.\n<br>4. If the machine is dry, never try to pick wet waste. v)Attachments should be stored in proper boxes.\n<br>\n<br><b>(II) FLOOR MAINTENANCE MACHINE\n</b><br>This is a multi functional machine which can scrub, polish and buff the floors. The machines have driving discs (single disc or three small discs rotated in opposite directions) colored nylon pads, water tank, shampoo tank, sprayer which are used for different functions. Lighter the color of the pads, the less strong it is. For scrubbing and stripping: Scrubbing is done with scrubbing brush or with scrubbing pad(black) attached to the disc which cuts the soil.\n<br>\n<br>For polishing: Red colored pads to apply polish on the floor\n<br>For buffing: beige or white pads are used to create high gloss finish.\n<br>\n<br><b>(III) WET EXTRACTION MACHINES:-\n</b><br> \n<br>Wet extraction machines are used to restore the surface appearance of carpet, upholstery and curtains. They remove deeply embedded soil not removed by suction cleaning.\n<br>Types of wet Extraction systems:-\n<br>● Hot water extraction machine-They carry a hot water tank and detergent used for deep cleaning carpet with high pressure spray nozzles and a suction unit to remove soiled solution from the surface.\n<br>● Solvent extraction machines- Used for cleaning upholstery and curtains.\n<br>\n<br><b>(IV)\tSHAMPOOING MACHINES:-\n</b><br>Brushes are made of nylon as it needs to be strong to get through the carpet pile. They are fixed to the discs of the floor maintenance machine. There are special pressure tank along with a foam generator which produces the foam in dry form which cleans the carpet and suspends the soil. This way carpet does not get too wet.\n<br>\n<br><b>(V) POWER SWEEPER:-</b>\n<br>These are self or manually operated machines designed to remove debris and loose soil from floor, pavement, car park, and large areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>(VI) SCARIFYING MACHINES:-</b><b><br></b>Scarifying is a process of removing heavy grease, mud, thick deposits of dirt from the floor by chisel like action with a wire brush cutting tool.\n<br>\n<br><b>STORAGE AND CARE OF CLEANING EQUIPMENT:-\n</b><br>● Equipment should be stored in areas which are locked properly.\n<br>● Proper records of issuing equipments should be maintained(Area, attachments given, time issued, whom issued to, time of return)\n<br>● Attachments and parts should be cleaned properly and stored after use.\n<br>● Brushes should never be faced downwards in the floor as it would damage the bristles.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

These products are also not tested on animals and tend to be biodegradable. Some of the herbs and natural substances frequently used in toiletries such as shampoos, conditioners, creams, lotions, and so on are aloe vera, liquorice, citrus fruit, Indian gooseberry, neem, sunflower, basil, pumpkin, cucumber, turmeric, sandalwood, apricot, mace, clove, nutmeg, coriander, rose, henna, clay (especially China clay), alum, and honey.\n<br><br><b>Textiles\n</b><br>Some international chains and ecotels are experimenting with textiles made of bamboo fibres as an environmentally sustainable material for bed and bath linen and uniforms. Bamboo is one of the world’s most prolific, regenerative crops and is grown without the use of any pesticides or fertilizers. Fabrics made of bamboo are naturally antibacterial and hypoallergenic. Bamboo fibres are usually blended with cotton (65%: 35% or 40%: 60%) to yield more absorbent, softer, and smell resistant luxury bath linen than normal ones. Bamboo fabrics have a unique silky texture and are superior to cotton in terms of softness, durability, and comfort and are therefore ideal for the manufacture of bed linen. The fabrics do not pill. The bamboo fibre under the microscope shows various gaps and holes and hence the fabrics made out of it can rapidly absorb and evaporate moisture, making them exceptionally comfortable. Moreover, bamboo is cool in summer and warm in winter.\n<br> \n<br><b>Energy-conserving Products\n</b><br>Housekeepers are now looking for products and equipment that help conserve energy. One such product is the jet hand-dryer that produces bi-directional jets of cold air jets that come to a head at 68 m/s to leave wet hands bone dry in seconds, in an alternative to the conventional hot-air drying process. The dryer is activated by placing the hands in the dryer bin, whereby the jet starts up automatically. The product’s primary advantage is the enormous power saving due to its low energy consumption compared to the conventional hot-air model: this machine runs at 700W, whereas the conventional hot-air dryers run at 2000W. This leads to huge savings in power bills-often as much as 67 per cent.\n<br>Housekeepers and interior designers today also have at their disposal energy-efficient lamps that consume a mere 9W of power and give the same light output as a 60W bulb. This can reduce power tariffs by as much as 80 per cent without taking away the aesthetic appeal of the property. Some trends in lighting that have been gaining momentum in Indian hotels are the use of luminaries and LEDs with sensor technology, compact luminaries and compact halogen lamps.\n<br><br>Acids can cause further staining on metals if it is not washed off quickly, and may spoil the glaze on sanitary fitments. Toilet cleansers rely on their acid content to clean and keep the W/C pan hygienic and remove metal stains. They can be crystalline, powdered or liquid.\n<br>Powdered toilet cleanser consists of a soluble acidic powder, chlorinated bleach, finely ground abrasive (to help when a brush is used) and an effervescing substance, which helps to spread the active ingredient throughout the water.\n<br>Liquid toilet cleaners are a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, and should be used with great care, because the concentration may cause damage to the surface of the pan, it’s surrounding areas, and to the person using it (if the liquid is split).\n<br>\n<br><b>ALKALIS:\n</b><br>These are used as cleaning agents in the form of liquids and powders. They are particularly useful in the laundry. Very strong alkalis should be used with utmost caution as they are corrosive and toxic. These are called caustic alkalis. Many alkalis act as bleaches.\n<br>Caustic soda- based cleaning agents are used to clear blocked drains and to clean ovens and other industrial equipment.\n<br>\n<br><b>ORGANIC SOLVENTS\n</b><br>These are chemicals that dissolve fat, oil, grease, wax or similar compounds from different surface, e.g. methylated spirit, white spirit (turpentine substitute), carbon tetrachloride. The former two are highly inflammable while carbon tetrachloride is harmful if inhaled, and hence should never be used in a closed area. Many are used for routine stain removal. They are harmful to skin and some surfaces and are fire hazardous.\n<br>\n<br><b>POLISHES\n</b><br>They do not necessarily clean but produce a shine by providing a smooth surface from which light is reflected evenly. They do this by smoothing out any unevenness on the surface of the article, in many cases by forming a thin layer of wax on the surface, thus giving some protection.\n<br><b><i>Metal polishes –</i></b> these remove the tarnish resulting from the attack on the metal by certain compounds and some foodstuffs. They are of two basic types, one for hard metal and other for soft. Either type may be liquid or paste. Liquid polish is a fine abrasive waxed with grease solvent, and sometimes with an acid, e.g. plate powder, precipitated whiting, jeweler’s rouge, methylated spirit, and ammonia. Abrasive when rubbed on the surface of the metal provides friction to remove the tarnish and produce a shine.\n<br><br><b><i>Floor polishes –</i></b>They are of two basic types – Spirit based&nbsp; and Water based.\n<br><br><b><i>Spirit based polishes</i></b> contain a blend of mainly natural waxes, dispersed in a spirit solvent. They may be in paste or liquid form and contain silicon, but too high a silicon content makes the floor slippery. The build up of polish can be removed by losing the wax finish with spirit and slight abrasion, and then picking up the loosened wax with a damp cloth mop. It is suitable for flooring those that are harmed by water like wood, cork, linoleum, and magnesite.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Water-based polishes </i></b>are emulsions in which fine particles of natural and synthetic waxes are dispersed in water. They are suitable for use on thermoplastic, rubber, PVC, asphalt and combination floors as spirits can affect them. They can also be used on sealed flooring of wood, cork, magnesite and linoleum. Water-based polishes are always liquid but maybe fully buff able, semi-buff able or dry bright. The build-up polish can be removed by loosening the wax synthetic resin with hot water and alkali – no detergent.\n<br>Floor polishes are floor waxes and have to be subjected to rough traffic. A more lasting surface can be obtained by use of a floor seal, with or without water based polish applied on it. Seals are semi-permanent materials, which renders the floor impermeable and protects it from dirt, stains and other foreign matter. They are not polishes.\n<br>Furniture polishes are intended for wooden furniture and fittings. They are protective finishes, which provide the surface of the furniture with a thin layer of wax or resin. This layer gives protection against abrasion, absorption of spillages and a smooth surface from which light may be reflected to give a shine or sheen. It consists of waxes dissolved in a varying amount of spirits. They are of four types –\n<br>● Paste wax polish – high proportion of wax plus silicon\n<br>● Cream polish – greater amounts of spirit to give a cleaning action.\n<br>● Liquid polish – has a great proportion of spirit requiring no buffing.\n<br>● Spray polish – also has a high proportion of spirit.\n<br>\n<br><b>FLOOR SEALERS\n</b><br>These are applied to flooring surfaces as a semi- permanent finish that acts as a protective barrier by preventing the entry of dirt, gems and liquid, grease, stains and bacteria. They prevent scratching and provide an easily maintainable surface. The right type of seal should be applied to each type of floor for effective protection and an attractive appearance. According to their functions, floor sealers can be finishing protective or combination of both.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Types of floor sealers\n</i></b><br>● Oleo-resinous sealers: they are used for imparting an attractive surface gloss penetrating the floor darkening the colour and highlighting the grain of wood floors.\n<br>● One-pot plastic sealers: they are used on wood, wood- composition, cork and magnesite floors.\n<br>● Two-pot plastic sealers: they are also used on wood, wood- composition, cork and magnesite floors.\n<br>● Pigmented sealers: these may be used on concrete, wood, wood-composition, magnesite, asphalt, and stone floors.\n<br>● water-based seals: these may be used on marble , terrazzo, magnesite, linoleum, rubber, thermoplastic tiles, PVCs, asphalt, concrete, stone-, and quarry tiles.\n<br>\n<br><b>BLEACHES\n</b><br>Bleaches used for cleaning purposes are generally alkaline stabilized solutions of sodium hypochlorite and are useful for stained sinks, W/C pans, etc, but they must never be mixed with other types of toilet cleansers. They whiten and have germicidal properties. Great care should be taken to prevent spotting on other surfaces.\n<br>\n<br><b>DIS-INFECTANTS AND DEODORANTS\n</b><br>Disinfectants, antiseptics and deodorants are not strictly cleaning agents, but are often used during the cleaning operations. Disinfectants kill bacteria; antiseptics prevent bacterial growth and are frequently diluted disinfectants. Use of disinfectants should not be necessary if the cleaning methods are correct.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Types of disinfectants:</i></b>\n<br>Disinfectants can be categorized in terms of their chemical action and compositions\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Phenols:</i></b> these are hydroxyl derivatives of the aromatic hydrocarbon benzene. They are used in dilute or high concentrations to disinfect surfaces in hospitals especially in hotels, diluted phenols are used with their sharp smell masked by other additives.\n<br><b><i>● Halogens: </i></b>the elements chlorine and iodine may be used as disinfectants .Chlorine is used both as bleach and as a disinfectant on many surfaces .Iodine is not often used to disinfectant surfaces because it tends to leave brown stains.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Quaternary ammonium compounds:</i></b> these are cationic surfactants useful as bactericides.\n<br>Natural pine oils: pine oils are obtained from pine trees. They are germicidal to some extent, but are mainly added changing formulation for their pleasant smell.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Deodorants</i></b> mask unpleasant smells by either combining chemically with the particle causing smell, or by their smell being predominant. This is not required where there is good ventilation and thorough cleaning.\n<br>They are used in restrooms, guestrooms, guest bathrooms, cloakrooms and public areas such as lobbies. Some deodorizers leave no trace of a perfume cover- up. They are usually available as aerosol sprays, Liquids, powders and crystalline blocks.\n<br>\n<br><b>WINDOW OR GLASS CLEANSERS\n</b><br>Window cleansers consist of water-miscible solvents, often isopropyl alcohol, to which small quantities of surfactants and possibly an alkali are added to improve the polishing effect of the cleanser. Some also contain fine abrasives. Most glass cleaners are available as sprays or liquid. They are sprayed directly onto windows, mirrors and other glass surfaces or applied on with a soft cloth and rubbed off using a soft, lint- free glass cloth. An inexpensive glass cleaner that can be readily made in the housekeeping department is soft water to which some vinegar is added can be used with old newspapers.\n<br>\n<br><b>ABSORBENTS\n</b><br>They carry out the action by absorbing the stain or grease. They are used only when the quantity of stain is too much. E.g. starch powder, fuller’s earth, bran, French chalk powder, etc.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In the more advanced stages, a&nbsp; further element occurs- that of creativity. Cookery is considered to be both an art and technology. Food preparation is a modern term in professional cookery. It denotes preparation and cooking. It follows a flow pattern that commences with the purchasing and selection materials, their handling, processing, and the ultimate presentation of dishes to customers, where “food service” takes over. In French, the word cuisine denotes –the art of cooking-preparing dishes and the place kitchen in which they are prepared.&nbsp;<br><br>Today’s “food-savvy” customers are a widely traveled group. They have increased exposure to other country’s food and restaurants and this has spurred them to have an interest in having these cuisines&nbsp;available at home. The result is growth in food outlets specializing in previously ‘unknown’ foods’. The public's’ growing interest in grain, legumes, fish, vegetables, and fruits along with a desire to reduce over consumption of animal fat, protein and sodium have helped popularize nutritional cooking. Furthermore, they have spurred fundamental changes in the preparation and presentation of\ntraditional foods. An evening out for dinner to a restaurant has become a form of entertainment – a restaurant is a destination where one can savor a quality experience. To provide this experience a\nnumber of things go hand in hand. At the front of the house, it’s the manager and his team who provide impeccable service in a beautiful and apt restaurant setup, but the most important figure is the chef who with his brigade of staff churns out exquisite food to satisfy every\nPalate.\n<br><br>Although cooking may have once been considered a less desirable job, today chefs are a new breed- respected, even admired, for their skill, craftsmanship, and even artistry. Some chefs have received so&nbsp; much press coverage that their names are household words. The elevation of the status of the chef helps attract bright and talented people to the industry.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

He should be able to:\n<br>● Organize and motivate people under him.\n<br>● Planning menus and production procedures.\n<br>● Controlling costs and managing budgets.\n<br>● Purchasing food supplies &amp; equipment.\n<br>● Must be an experienced chef in order to schedule food production.\n<br>● Train and instruct workers.\n<br>● Control quality.\n<br>\n<br><b>2) Technical level:</b> The cooks are the backbone of the kitchen. These workers carry out the actual food production. They must have knowledge of and experience in cooking techniques. They must be able to function well with their fellow workers and coordinate with other departments. Cooking food in hotels is a team activity.\n<br>\n<br><b>3) Entry-level:</b> this level of workers usually requires no particular skills &amp; experience. The jobs assigned to them are stewarding or basic pre-preparation of vegetables. As their knowledge, skill &amp; experience increases, they may be given a more complex task which will eventually make them skilled chefs. Many Ex-chefs begin their career as pot washers. Beginning in an entry-level position and working one’s way up has been the traditional way of advancing in a food service career. Today, however, who is a graduate from hotel management start at entry-level already possessing knowledge of food production practices, which would give them a head start over other beginners who have no knowledge.\n<br>\n<br><b>B. ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR IN THE KITCHEN\n</b><br>\n<br>A CUISINE means the kitchen. Also ‘Art of cooking’\n<br>\n<br><b>C</b>are of equipment\n<br><b>U</b>nderstanding the basic method (to achieve quality)\n<br><b>I</b>ntegrity in handling &amp; serving food \n<br><b>S</b>afety in handling equipment \n<br><b>I</b>nitiatives you will have to take\n<br><b>N</b>eatness during work &amp; presentation. \n<br><b>E</b>fficiency of yourself.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>“Be positive and think positive’’\n</i></b><br>\n<br>The emphasis of a food service education is on learning a set of skills. But attitudes are more important because a good attitude will help you not only to learn skills but also to preserve and overcome many difficulties you will face in your career. The successful food service workers follow an unwritten code of behavior and set of attitudes, which may we call “professionalism”.\n<br>\n<br>Set of qualities are:-\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. positive attitude</i></b> towards the job: in order to be a good professional chef you must like cooking and want to do it well. The satisfaction of doing your job well and making everything run smoothly will give you enjoyment, which you will always cherish. A chef with a positive attitude works quickly, efficiently, neatly, and safely. Professional chefs take pride in their work and want to make sure that the work is something to be proud of.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>2. Staying power:</i></b> A food service personnel requires good health, physical and mental stamina, and a willingness to work for longer hours.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>3. Ability to work</i></b> with people: works as a team &amp; it is essential to be able to work well as a team and to co-operate with your colleagues.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>4. Communication:\n</i></b><br>● With your supervisors: let them know your difficulties.\n<br>● With your colleagues: share knowledge and also learn from them. Nobody knows everything.\n<br>● With your subordinates: respect them &amp; be courteous.\n<br>● With the food &amp; beverage staff: control your temper.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>5. Eagerness to learn:</i></b> there is more to learn about cooking than you will learn in a lifetime. The food service industry is changing so rapidly that it is vital to be open to new ideas. No matter how good your techniques are, you might learn an even better way to do the same thing, which you must have been doing for a long time.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>6. Must develop a full range of skills:</i></b> A chef must not only be a good cook but is also important to develop and maintain other skills that are necessary for the profession. <br>● Must be able to understand and manage food cost and other financial matters\n<br>● Manage and maintain proper inventories.\n<br>● Deal with suppliers.\n<br>● Understand personnel management.<br>\n<br><b><i>7. Experience: </i></b>there is no substitute for years of experience. Practice more &amp; more to gain more experience.\n<br><br><b><i>8. Aiming for quality: </i></b>whatever you do must have a distinctive sign of quality.\n<br><br><b><i>9. Creativity:</i></b> the sky is a limit, as in “nouvelle cuisine’’.\n<br><br><b><i>10. Return to basics: </i></b>experiments and innovation need a good understanding of basics first.\n<br><br><b><i>11. Care of equipment:</i></b> equipment has been put at your disposal to help you. TAKE CARE OF IT. Treat it as your own, even if it does not belong to you, for others will also be using it.\n<br><br><b><i>12. Safety: </i></b>kitchens can be dangerous places injuries can occur by cuts, burns, handling of machines and equipment, falling, etc. Think about yours as well as others’ safety first.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Hence the first step in preventing food-borne disease is good personal –hygiene. Food handler play an important role in ensuring food safety throughout the chain of production, processing, storage, and preparation. Mishandling and disregard of hygienic measures on their part may enable pathogens to come into contact with food and in some cases, to survive and multiply in sufficient numbers to cause illness in the customer on the consumer.\n<br>As a food handler, one must ensure that the food provided to the consumer is free from all types of contamination.\n<br><br>The ability of the food handler to ensure the wholesomeness of the food prepared and served will depend upon following a few basic rules of personal hygiene and good food handling. <b><i>These rules can be divided into 3 groups.\n</i></b><br>\n<br><b>1. General personal hygiene:</b> A hygienic appearance of professionals is indicated by high standards of personal cleanliness and is shown by the cleanliness of hair, hands, face, clothing, and shoes. Good personal hygiene helps prevent food-borne disease; therefore these points must be put into practice.\n<br>● Shower or bath daily.\n<br>● Wear clean clothes and a uniform.\n<br>● Do not work if suffering from a communicable disease.\n<br>● Handle food as little as possible.\n<br>● Wash hands before and during work and every time after using the toilet.\n<br>● Keep hair clean and do not handle them in the kitchen.\n<br>● Do not touch nose &amp; mouth with hands.\n<br>● Do not cough or sneeze over food, use a tissue.\n<br>● Do not wear rings, earrings, jewelry &amp; watches.\n<br>● Do not smoke in food preparation areas.\n<br>● Taste food with a clean spoon.\n<br>● Do not sit on a work surface.\n<br>● Footwear should be clean, safe, and topped with steel toe.\n<br>● Chef cap should always be worn when handling food.\n<br>● Open cuts, burns, etc. Must be covered with a waterproof dressing.\n<br>● Persons suffering from diarrhea, sore throat, vomiting, cold, etc. Must not handle food.\n<br><br>If a person becomes aware that they are suffering from or are carriers of typhoid, paratyphoid, salmonella, or staphylococcal infection, the person responsible for the operation must be informed, who then must inform the medical officer of health.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Clean hands:</b>&nbsp;The following actions require immediate hand washing before continuing work.\n<br>● Contact with infected or otherwise unsanitary areas of the body.\n<br>● Use of handkerchief or tissue.\n<br>● Hand contact with unclean equipment and work, surfaces, soiled clothing, or cleaning towels.\n<br>● Handling raw food, particularly meat, poultry, and fish items.\n<br>● Cleaning away soiled dishes and utensils.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Procedure for Washing Hands \n</i></b><br>• Wet your hands with hot running water. Use water as hot as you can comfortably stand, but at least 100°F (38°C). \n<br>• Apply enough soap to make a good lather. \n<br>• Rub hands together thoroughly for 20 seconds or longer, washing not only the hands but the wrists and the lower part of the forearms. \n<br>• Using a nail brush, clean beneath the fingernails and between the fingers. \n<br>• Rinse hands well under hot running water. If possible, use a clean paper towel to turn off the water to avoid contaminating the hands by contact with soiled faucets. \n<br>• Dry hands with clean single-use paper towels or a warm-air hand dryer\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Food handling\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>Hygiene In Handling Food\n</i></b><br>\n<br><b>1. DRY FOOD STORAGE:</b> Avoid moisture, use an air-tight container, and avoid insect &amp; rodents.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. FREEZER STORAGE:</b> Well-packed food with label store at -18*c, follow FIFO &amp; thaw properly before use.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. COLD ROOM STORAGE:</b> cooked items away from the raw items. Store everything in a container. Chill food before refrigeration. Keep the temperature under 5*c.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. HOT FOOD STORAGE:</b> Do not reheat in a bain-marie. Cover all the food, keep food above 65*c.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. FOOD HANDLING:\n</b><br>● Work with fresh &amp; safe food.\n<br>● Use clean equipment &amp; work table.\n<br>● Wash &amp; wipe tools( knives, chopping board, etc.) after every use.\n<br>● Wash ingredients.\n<br>● Reboil stocks, sauces, soups, milk before reuse.\n<br>● Do not mix batches of cooked food.\n<br>● Use separate tools for vegetables &amp; meats.\n<br>● Use separate tools for raw &amp; cooked food.\n<br>● Quickly chill all high-risk food for cold storage.\n<br>● Keep work area clean.\n<br>● FIFO( first in first out)\n<br>\n<br><b>UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING\n</b><br>“More of protective clothing than uniform.” The chef’s uniform consists of the following:\n<br>\n<br><b>Toque/Head-wear\n</b><br>• Keeps the head cool and prevents the hair from falling into the food.\n<br>• Cotton/cloth caps are difficult to maintain whereas, paper caps are disposable hence they are neat.\n<br>\n<br><b>Scarf/Neckerchief\n</b><br>• Absorbs sweat.\n<br>• Identification/designation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Double-breasted jacket\n</b><br>• Protects the chest and front.\n<br>• Easy to remove overhead or sideways.\n<br>• Cotton cloth buttons – heat resistant.\n<br>\n<br><b>Apron\n</b><br>• Below-knee level.\n<br>• Double protection prevents the jacket &amp; trousers from becoming dirty.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cotton checked trousers\n</b><br>• Double shade hides the dirt.\n<br>• Identifies designation.\n<br>\n<br><b>Shoes and Socks\n</b><br>• Clogs can be used but it is expensive\n<br>• Metal frame in front protects the toes.\n<br>• Easy to remove legs.\n<br>• Socks\n<br>• Absorbs sweat.\n<br>• Provides good grip.\n<br>• Steady steps while walking\n<br><br><br><b>KNIVES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>KNIFE MATERIALS\n</b><br>The metal that a knife blade is made of is an important consideration, as the metal must be able to take and hold a very fine edge.\n<br>\n<br>1. Carbon steel was for many years the traditional favorite because it can be honed to an extremely sharp edge. Its disadvantages are that it corrodes and discolors easily, especially when used with acid foods and onions. Also, it discolors some foods(such as hard-cooked eggs) and may leave a metallic taste. Because of these disadvantages, it has given way to high-carbon stainless steel (described in item 3 below),which is now the preferred material for the best knives.\n<br>\n<br>2. Traditional stainless-steel alloys will not rust or corrode, but they are much harder to sharpen than carbon steel. Stainless steel is used mostly for low-cost, lightweight knives.\n<br>\n<br>3. High-carbon stainless steel is a relatively new alloy that combines the best aspects of carbon steel and stainless steel. It takes an edge almost as well as carbon steel, and it will not rust, corrode, or discolor. Knives made of this material are highly prized and relatively expensive.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>KNIFE AND ITS PARTS\n</b><br>The importance of knives to a chef cannot be overstated. It is the most important piece of equipment in the kitchen. Knives come in various shapes and sizes and each is meant for a specific use though some knives can be used as multi-purpose knives. Let us now familiarize ourselves with different parts of a knife.\n<br>\n<br><b>Blade:</b> The blade is usually made up of a metal compound called high carbon stainless steel. It combines the property of carbon being sharpened easily and non-corrosive properties of steel. \n<br>\n<br><b><i>The different parts of a blade are:\n</i></b><br>●&nbsp;<b>Tip:</b> The tip of the knife is the pointed edge where the knife blade ends. The tip generally is used for scoring patterns and working with meats or carving.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Spine:</b> The spine of the knife is the topmost, thick edge of the knife, which gives strength to the knife.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Bolsters:</b> In some knives there is a collar known as a bolster, at the point where the blade meets the handle. It reinforces the structure of a knife.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Cutting edge:</b> The cutting edge is the most important part of the knife. It should always be kept honed and sharpened.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Handle: </b>The handle of a knife should be easy to grip, non-reactive to most cleaning agents. The different materials used to make handles are wood, plastic, plastic fibre or even metal.\n<br>·         <i>1. Tang: </i>The tang is the continuation of the blade and extends into a knife’s handle.\n<br>·         <i>2. Rivets: </i>These are metal fasteners that hold the handle and the tang together.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Modern cuisine began in the middle of the eighteenth century. At this&nbsp; time, food production in France was controlled by special “GUILDS”. Caterers, pastry makers, roasters, and pork butchers held licenses to prepare specific items. An innkeeper, in order to serve a meal to guests, had to buy the various menu items from those operations that&nbsp;were licensed to provide them. Guests had little or no choice and simply ate what was available for that meal. In 1765, a Parisian chef named Boulanger began advertising on his shop sign that “we serve soups”, which he called restaurants or restoratives (literally, the word means “fortifying”). <br><br>According to the story, one of the dishes he served was sheep’s feet in cream sauce. The guild of stew makers challenged him in court for violation of the guilds act... but Boulanger won by claiming he didn’t stew the feet in the sauce but served them with the sauce. In challenging the rules of the guilds, Boulanger unwillingly changed the face for the course of food service history. The new developments in food service received a great stimulus as in the result of the French Revolution, beginning in 1789. Before this time; the great chefs were employed in the houses of the French&nbsp; Authorities. With the revolution and the end of the monarchy, many chefs suddenly got out of work and opened restaurants and inns where they could serve dinners reflecting the talent and creativity of their own chefs, rather than being forced to rely on licensed caterers to supply their food. At the start of the French revolution, there were about 50 restaurants in Paris, ten years later there were about 500. Another important invention that changed the organization of kitchens in the eighteenth century was the stove.\n<br>\n<br><b>CHEF CAREˆME\n</b><br>Marie-Antoine Careme (1784-1833). As a young man, Careme learned all the branches of cooking quickly, and he dedicated his career to refining and organizing culinary techniques. His many books contain the first systematic account of cooking principles, recipes, and menu making.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chef Escoffier</b>\n<br>Georges Auguste Escoffier (1847-1935), the greatest chef of his time, is still today revered by chefs and the gourmet industry as the father of twentieth-century cookery.&nbsp;His two main contributions were:\n<br><br><b><i>1) the simplification of classical cuisine and the classical menu</i></b><br><b><i>2) the reorganization of the kitchen.\n</i></b><br><br>Escoffier rejected what he called the “general confusion” of the old menus, in which sheer quantity seemed to be the most important factor. Instead, he called for order and diversity and emphasized the careful selection of one or two dishes per course, dishes that followed one another harmoniously and delighted the taste with their delicacy and simplicity. Escoffier’s books and recipes are still important references works for professional chefs. The basic cooking methods and preparations we study today are based on Escoffier’s work. His book “Le guide Culinary”, which is still widely used, arranges recipes in a simple system based on the main ingredient a cooking method, according to Escoffier, begin with learning a relatively few basic procedures and understand basic ingredients.\n<br>Escoffier’s second major achievement, the reorganization of the kitchen, resulted in a streamlined workplace that was better suited to turning out the simplified dishes and menus he instituted. The system of the organization he established is still in use today, especially in large hotels and full-service restaurants.\n<br>\n<br><b>Modern technology\n</b><br>Today’s kitchen looks much different from those of Escoffier’s day, though our basic cooking principles are the same. Also, the dishes we eat have gradually changed due to the innovations and creativity of modern chefs. The process of simplification and refinement, to which chef Careme and Escoffier made monumental contributions, is still ongoing, adapting classical cooking to modern conditions and tastes.\n<br>\n<br><b>Development of new equipment</b>\n<br>Modern refrigeration and rapid transportation caused revolutionary changes in eating habits. For the first time, fresh foods of all kinds of meats, fish, vegetables, and fruits- became available throughout the year. Exotic delicacies can now be shipped from anywhere in the world and arrive fresh in peak condition. The development of preservation techniques-not just refrigeration but also freezing,\ncanning, freeze-drying, vacuum packing, and irradiation increased the availability of most foods and made affordable some that were once rare and expensive.\n<br><b><br></b><br><b>Cooking in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n</b><br>A generation after Escoffier, the most influential chef in the middle of the twentieth century was Fernand Point (1897-1955). Working quietly and steadily in his restaurant, La Pyramide, in Vienne, France, point simplified and lightened classical cuisine. “point insisted that every meal should be a little marvel” Many of his apprentices, such as Paul Bocuse, Jean, and Pierre Troisgros, and Alain Chapel, went on to become some of the greatest stars of modern cooking. They, along with other chefs in their generation, became best known in the 1960's and early 1970's for a style of cooking called nouvelle cuisine. Reacting to what they saw as a heavy, stodgy, overly complicated classical cuisine, these chefs took point’s lighter approach even further. <br><br>They rejected many traditional principles, such as a dependence on flour to thicken sauces, and instead urged simpler, more natural flavors and preparations, with lighter sauces and seasonings and shorter cooking times. In traditional classical cuisine, many dishes were plated in the dining room by\nwaiters. Nouvelle cuisine, however, placed a great deal of emphasis on artful plating presentations done by the chef in the kitchen. Very quickly, however, this “simpler” style became extravagant and\ncomplicated, famous for strange combinations of foods and fussy, ornate arrangements and designs. By the 1980s, nouvelle cuisine was the subject of jokes.\n<br>\n<br><b>CULINARY HISTORY SUMMARY\n</b><br>❖ Modern cuisine began in the middle of the 18th century.\n<br>❖ At that time it was controlled by the guilds used for licensing of butchery, baker, pastry maker, or for specific items.\n<br>❖ In 1765, a Paris citizen named Boulanger begun to advertise his shop sign (which used to serve soup) named called restaurants or restorative which stands for fortifying.\n<br>❖ According to the story, the dish that he uses to serve was sheep feet in cream sauce &amp; the guild got offended by this thing &amp; challenged him in court but Boulanger won the case by saying he didn’t cook the feet in the sauce but served the sauce with feet.\n<br>❖ In a challenge, the Boulanger unwillingly changed the course of the food history.\n<br>❖ Before the French revolution in 1789, the food industry in France saw so many ups &amp; downs &amp; before this time great chefs were employed in royal palaces or high French nobilities.\n<br>❖ With the revolution, it ended up and chefs were free from this foundation due to these chefs were out of work &amp; started opening their restaurants.\n<br>❖ Revolutionist government abolished the monarchy of guilds, at the\n<br>start of the revolution there were 50 restaurants in Paris, but ten years later they grew up to 500.\n<br>❖ The stove was again invented at the end of the 18th century and the use of fuel started.\n<br>\n<br><b>Modern Technology\n</b><br>These days kitchen looks more difficult than the days of Escoffier or chef Careme, also the dishes have gradually changed due to the creativity of modern chefs whereas basics remain the same and it is still going on.\n<br><b><i>Development of new equipment\n</i></b><br>• Electric range\n<br>• Infrared cooking\n<br>• Microwaves\n<br>• Thermal power heated cooking trap\n<br>• Motorized food processor.\n<br><b><i>Cooling, freezing, heating, &amp; processing is more simplified.\n</i></b><br>• Development and availability of new food products.\n<br>Modern refrigeration &amp; quick transportation has caused revolutionary changes in eating habits. For the first time, fresh foods of all kinds meats, fish, vegetables &amp; fruits have become available throughout the year. Freezing, canning, irradiation.\n<br> \n<br><b>NOUVEELLE CUISINE\n</b><br>A generation after Escoffier was the most influential chefs like Fernand Point (1897-1955) working quietly in his restaurant “Le Pyramide” in Vienne- France. Chef point re simplified and lightened\nthe classical cuisine he insisted that every food must be handled as “a little marvel”. Many of his apprentices like Chef Paul Bocuse, Jean Pierre &amp; Chef Troisgros with Alain chapel went on to become the greatest stars of modern cuisine. These chefs started the foundation of nouvelle cuisine which was more sophisticated and delightful, whereas they rejected many of the traditional methods &amp; principles of cooking and introduced new ones.\n<br>\n<br>Nouvelle cuisine emphasized neat &amp; artful plating techniques it got so fussed about &amp; complicated and became the subject of jokes (later on asked for a return to basics).\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

This structure – which makes clear that all employees are under the leadership of another person or department.\n<br>Hierarchical management is a workplace leadership structure in which authority is assigned in ranks and employees take directions from their superiors. \n<br>\n<br><b>HIERARCHY AND KITCHEN STAFFING\n</b><br>Hierarchy refers to the flow of authority from top to bottom in an organization and with respect to the kitchen. It refers to the flow of authority commencing from executive chef and goes to the bottom i.e. kitchen staffing refers to not only assigning the positions but also filling them with the suitable manpower. Staffing is the actual strength of the employees working at different levels, which depends upon the various factors as:\n<br>\n<br>• The extent of the menu and the market a kitchen is serving.\n<br>• Use of prepared convenience foods.\n<br>• Types of equipment available.\n<br>• Need of skill involved at the various levels\n<br>• The size of the establishment\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Kitchen organisation: The organisation of the hotel and restaurant kitchen depends upon the:\n</i></b><br>• Size of the operation\n<br>• Type of the menu\n<br>• Type of the service\n<br>• Type of clientele.\n<br>\n<br><b>CLASSICAL BRIGADE</b>\n<br>Chef Auguste Escoffier gave the concept of classical brigade, which means the actual work force requirement of any particular establishment. He divided whole of the kitchen into parties/ corners\nand the system is followed in the organizations. Purpose of the classical brigade is to fix the duties and responsibilities and fix the area of work by party/ corner. We mean grill party, roast party, vegetarian party etc. It was the time when few machines were available so more need was there to know about the manpower requirements.\nFollowing are the key points related to the classical brigade in a professional kitchen:-<br><br>* A professional kitchen operates with a very distinct rank just like army of soldiers , probably this is why Escoffier called it a brigade.\n<br>* Each member of the kitchen has his/her role to play for the success of a team.\n<br>* It was based on the various sections of the kitchen (for ex. Pastry, butchery, bakery etc.)\n<br>* Every section was named in French.\n<br>*Every section featured a head of department, with cooks, helpers and porters working under him/her<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The cost of land and construction of building, or the rent which will have to&nbsp; be paid for a ready site\n<br>2. overhead costs incurred\n<br>3. equipment, fittings, fixtures and furnishings required\n<br>4. number and type of potential customers\n<br>\n<br>Apart from these considerations, it is necessary to give a careful thought to the hygiene aspect. This is crucial for the business to run successfully, otherwise a large portion of Money would be spent on trying to maintain hygienic standards in the establishment.\n<br>\n<br>Some of the important aspects which should not be neglected are listed below.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>1. Air:</i></b> The surrounding atmosphere should be free from pollutants like smoke, dust and fumes.\n<br><b><i>2. Vicinity: </i></b>The Area around the establishment should be clean. Garbage dumps and stagnant water in the vicinity encourage breeding of rodents, flies and mosquitoes.\n<br><b><i>3. Water supply: </i></b>An adequate supply of potable water should be available round the clock and the premises should have sufficient storage tanks, wash basins and sanitary conveniences which are suitably located. Proper sewage disposal facilities should be available.\n<br><b><i>4. Lighting and ventilation:</i></b> Natural light and ventilation is preferred in the premises. Dark and dingy rooms and passages should be avoided. Basement kitchens need special lighting and ventilation.\nCareful consideration while planning windows and drains is necessary to prevent contamination of food.\n<br><b><i>5. Space:\n</i></b><br>(a) In the kitchen: The work area should be large enough to&nbsp; ensure Safety at work\n<br>1. provide convenience and comfort to the workers\n<br>2. Prevent Overcrowding\n<br>3. avoid criss-crossing of traffic lines\n<br>4. Prevent queue at sinks and wash basins\n<br>5. reduce unnecessary walking\n<br>6. ensure adequate work tables and storage space\n<br>7. keep cooked and raw food apart.\n<br>\n<br>If the work area is not well planned, the employee may tend to overlook hygienic practices while handling food. A poorly set up establishment leads to wastage of time and energy, frustrations and difficulties, and increases the likelihood of accidents. In short, it affects the overall work achieved in terms of quality and quantity.\n<br>\n<br>The kitchen and dish-washing area should generally be approximately half the size of the service area. Each worker requires 3m2 (33 sq ft) of floor area to enable him to work comfortably. The minimum size of the kitchen should be 9.3m2 (100 sq ft) and ceiling should be at a minimum height of 2.5m (8 ft).\n<br>\n<br>(b) In the service area:\n<br>1. Tables and chairs should be well spaced with no overcrowding\n<br>2. Waiters should be able to serve all customers, and clear and clean all tables comfortable. For a restaurant having a capacity of fifty covers, the space required is 1.4m2 (15sq ft) per cover.\n<br>\n<br><b>LAYOUT AND PREMISES\n</b><br>\n<br>A well planned and designed food service area is a prerequisite for maintaining high standards of&nbsp; sanitation. Premises should be planned to facilitate cleaning and all equipment should be designed and arranged to prevent accumulation of soil and contamination of food.&nbsp; An ideal situation would be one where things move forward in orderly progression, beginning from receiving food in the stores to preparation, service and cleaning up. If food has to move through a shorter distance and if it is handled less, the chances of it getting contaminated will be greatly reduced.\n<br>While planning the layout it is necessary to understand the purpose of every piece of equipment&nbsp; and every room and avoid wastage of money and space by building unnecessary corridors or rooms of inappropriate sizes.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Receiving Area</b>\n<br>The receiving area is located near the stores. The stores should be so located that food is brought\n<br>in by the shortest route. This entrance is separate from the customers entrance and opens into a cemented yard. Adequate space should be provided for delivery vans to stop in front of the door&nbsp;and deliver goods at the doorstep. The gas bank and garbage bins should be located in the yard.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Storage Area\n</b><br>This includes the dry food store, the cold store and the frozen stores. All these areas are located near the receiving entrance. Each area should have a sink, a drain and a garbage bin.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Kitchen\n</b><br>The kitchen is divided into two areas -  the hot kitchen and the cold kitchen. The kitchen is accessible only to kitchen employees and should not be used as a thoroughfare or a shortcut to reach other parts of the building. Depending on the size and type of establishment, the kitchen may be divided into separate rooms for separate activities or all sections may be included in one large room and different areas demarcated for different activities. The main point to be kept in mind here is that the flow of work should not be hampered.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>While planning the kitchen layout begin with listing down the following:\n</i></b><br>1. different sections which are to be included\n<br>2. nature of work done in these sections\n<br>3. equipment which is to be installed\n<br>4. natural ventilation and lighting available\n<br>5. water supply\n<br>6. location of sinks and drains\n<br>7. furniture and fixtures needed\n<br>\n<br>The kind and volume of equipment, furniture and fixtures required will depend on the type of establishment, volume of business and space available. If space is a constraint, it is advisable to utilize wall space. Built-in cupboards, fixed racks and shelves as well as folding or collapsible furniture do not use up floor space. All fixed equipment and shelves should be easy to clean. Other equipment should be arranged so that there is sufficient area for routine cleaning.\n<br>Cooking ranges can be placed in the center of the room, away from doors, to keep dust and air droughts away. They should have a canopy or hood and an exhaust fan to remove fumes and odour from the kitchen.\n<br>Sinks should be placed against the external wall, closest to the drain. Each worktable should ideally have a removable garbage bin fitted on a trolley placed under the table. All work tables should be movable and easy to clean.\n<br>The rice boiler and potato peeler should be located near a drain. It should be fitted with a strainer and a trap for catching the wastes. The dry preparation zone of the kitchen should have running\nhot and cold water sinks.\n<br>Sufficient storage space should be provided for other small equipment when not in use. Pots and&nbsp; pans should be stored upside down on racks or slatted shelves, Pots and pans with long handles\nshould be stored on hooks. No utensils or food should be placed on the floor.\n<br>The refrigerator should be located in a cool place, as far as possible from any source of heat. Every Kitchen should have freezer, chiller and cooling store facilities, even if all three are in the same unit.\n<br><br><b><i>Washing Up</i></b> A separate washing up area should be available for (i) pots and pans, and should be&nbsp; located near the preparation area, and (ii) crockery and cutlery and should be near the pantry.\nThe wash up area should not be located near food preparation and storage areas. Sinks used for&nbsp; washing pots, pans and crockery should not be used for handwashing or washing foodstuff.\n<br>Washed and dried dishes should be stored in clean, dry cupboards located near both the kitchen&nbsp;and service area.\nThe crockery store should be protected from pests and dust. Plates can be stacked on drying\nracks and cups can be stored bottom upwards in wiretrays. Cutlery is stored in partitioned drawers\nor in partitioned covered boxes or trays.\nThe service linen cupboard should be closer to the dining area. The pantry should be located between the kitchen and dining area and should allow the forward flow of food from the kitchen to the restaurant or dining area. The restaurant should have two doors—one leading in from the pantry\nand one leading to the wash-up area.\n<br>\n<br><b>Staff Rooms</b>\n<br>Changing rooms equipped with lockers should be provided for all employees. Lockers should\nbe large enough to accommodate hangers. Protective clothes and outdoor clothes should be kept\nseparately. The use of the kitchen as a changing room or staff room should be discouraged. Clothes\nhanging or drying in the food preparation area is not only unsightly but unhygienic as well. The changing rooms should have good washing facilities. A linen basket must be provided for dirty linen. Laundering, repair and replacement of worn out protective clothing is the responsibility of the management.\n<br>\n<br><b>Sanitary Accommodation\n</b><br>Facilities should be adequate, convenient, hygienic and well-stocked. Separate sanitary accommodation is necessary for employees and customers and should be readily accessible at a distance of 3m. These rooms should be well equipped. Separate rooms should be provided for males and females and labeled accordingly. Sanitary towel disposers or bins should be fitted in the ladies toilets with instructions for use clearly mentioned, or they should be disposed of by wrapping in disposable bags and discarding in a covered bin.\n<br>\n<br>Toilets should be well lit and properly ventilated. They should not open directly into the food area. A well-ventilated corridor or space between the toilet and food preparation area or service area is a desirable feature. Adequate toilets and washbasins should be provided. Washbasins should be made of porcelain or stainless steel and should be used for handwashing only. A continuous supply of hot and cold water should be ideally available at each washbasin. Soap should be kept in a suitable container. Each basin should have a foot-operated bin for disposal of towels, etc. Alternatively, a warm air dryer can be provided. They are the most hygienic way of drying hands. Instructions for operating the hand dryer should be displayed near the machine.\n<br><br><b>BUILDING INTERIORS\n</b><br>Sanitation should be kept in mind right from the time when the building plan is being prepared.\nAs far as possible built-in sanitation should be looked for in the construction design at well as 2&nbsp; every piece of equipment, fittings, fixtures and utilities.&nbsp;Apart from good appearance, the clean ability, life and maintenance required are important: factors that have to be considered. <i>Before selecting any material, the manager should review the following points.\n<br></i>\n<br>1. Is the surface smooth or will it harbour dust, dirt and pests?\n<br>2. Can soil be washed off easily?\n<br>3. Will it withstand regular cleaning and use?\n<br>4. How long will it be of service or will it need frequent maintenance and replacement?\n<br>5. Can the surface finish be changed?\n<br>\n<br>If all the above points are not thought about while selecting material for walls, ceilings and floors, the food service manager will be faced with a difficult and expensive task in maintaining a high level of sanitation desirable in the establishment.\n<br>\n<br>Interiors chosen only on the basis of appearance and which are difficult to clean will low good for a short while only. Once soiled, they will look much worse. Grease, dust, betel-nut stains, food stains and cobwebs are often seen on floors, walls and ceilings, and if this is not completely removed the place will have a permanently dirty look.\n<br>\n<br><b>Floors\n</b><br>The floors in work areas of catering establishments should be made of durable material because of the following reasons:\n<br>\n<br>1. they have to withstand heavy traffic.\n<br>2. equipment used is heavy-duty equipment which weighs a lot.\n<br>3. they are exposed to high temperatures.\n<br>4. water and grease are likely to spill on floors.\n<br>5. frequent cleaning is necessary.\n<br>\n<br>The floors should be sturdy, easy to clean and resistant to the effect of hot water, sanitizers and detergents. They should be non-absorbent, grease-resistant, dirt resistant, smooth, sealed and pest resistant. They should also be non-slippery and impervious. In areas where floors have to be washed regularly, like walk-in refrigerators, a drainage system and slope should be provided. Floors should be self-draining. All drains should have a perforated removable metal cover and should be tiled underneath. Any spillage should be mopped up immediately to prevent falls.\n<br>\n<br>Floors can be made from a variety of materials which may be natural or manmade. The manager&nbsp; should choose flooring on the basis of its quality and the budget available. Natural materials include a wide selection of quarry tiles such as Shahbad, Kota, Kadappa; marble: wood; concrete: granite; mosaic and ceramic.\nMan-made materials include linoleum, vinyl) asbestos, rubber and cork.\n<br>On the whole, flooring should offer complete unbroken surfaces. If jointed, the joints or grouts should be carefully made and well sealed.\nEasily cleanable carpeting is also permissible in restaurants. Carpeting should be properly installed and only used in areas where no food or beverage preparation takes place. They create warmth, deaden sound and provide safety from falls and breakages as long as they are well installed, Carpets are made of wool, nylon, polyester, olefin and jute. They should be vacuum cleaned daily and shampooed regularly to remove food spillages, dirt and dust. If cleaning is a problem, granite can be used in restaurants. Although the initial cost is high it requires little maintenance and looks beautiful.\n<br>\n<br>Mats and duckboards should be used on slippery floors. They should be easy to remove and clean. Areas that obstruct routine cleaning - like flooring behind fixed equipment, below tables and racks, at the junction of the floor and wall - need extra attention.\n<br>\n<br><b>Walls\n</b><br>\n<br>Walls should be smooth, durable, impervious, washable and light in colour. They should be rounded\nat junctions with floors and ceilings. They should be in good repair to prevent the accumulation of dust, dirt and vermin and to make cleaning easy. All cracks and crevices should be sealed to prevent pests from entering and multiplying.\n<br>The best finish for walls in the kitchen and wash up area is ceramic tiles. If only the lower part of the wall is tiled, then it should extend till a height of 1.8 m (6 feet). Walls that are not tiled should be plastered.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Wall Finishes\n</b><br><b><i>1. Dry distemper or coloured lime-washed walls</i></b> They will not stand frequent cleaning. Washable oil- bound distemper can stand regular washing but might pose a problem while removing absorbed grease. Grease marks can be rubbed off with the help of turpentine. Non-washable distemper rubs off easily and is not suitable for walls in a catering establishment.\n<br><b><i>2. Emulsion paints Emulsion paints</i></b> can be used over dis-tempered surfaces but they cannot be applied directly over gloss finished surfaces. These surfaces have to be roughened by rubbing down with sand or glass paper. A plastic finish can be applied directly over concrete, brickwork, wood, stone or galvanized iron. It can also be directly applied over painted or dis-tempered surfaces. The advantage of plastic paint is that it does not crack or discolour and can withstand water and repeated scrubbing with acidic and alkaline cleaning agents. Other varieties of paints available for use are PVC, acrylic, enamel, epoxy and rubber paint. Textured paint finishes are not recommended. Lead-based paints are not suitable in food service areas as accidental flaking or chipping can cause food poisoning.\n<br><b><i>3. Wall pape</i></b>r It is not suitable for the kitchen where food is prepared as it tends to peel off with the\n<br>high heat and humidity. Plastic coated papers can be used in dry areas. Paint should be used for the walls of the dry food store as it is easy to clean.\n<br><b><i>4. Splash plates, tiles and panels Walls</i></b> behind cooking ranges, ovens and grills can spoil because of&nbsp;excessive heat, grease and steam of normal working. Walls in the kitchen, especially those near the\nsink and cooking equipment, should be able to withstand moisture, high temperature and physical\ndamage. Splash plates or tiled surfaces should be provided near the equipment on the wall. Ceramic\ntiles should be evenly fitted and should have smooth, waterproof and continuous grouting. Stainless steel is more durable than tiles and is a better option in areas where wear and tear are high.\n<br><b><i>5. Plastic tiles</i></b> may be used in cool places but they are likely to lose their glossy surface even under\nlight abrasive cleaning.\n<br><b><i>6. Glass panels</i></b> are suitable for wall areas likely to become dirty and those that need frequent cleaning.\n<br><br>The ability to get cleaned is thus an important criterion in selecting wall finishes. Walls should help in noise reduction by absorbing sound. Light-colored walls show up dirt and improve the distribution of light, which is why they are preferred.\n<br>\n<br><b>Ceilings\n</b><br>All ceilings should be free from cobwebs, cracks and flaking. They should not harbour dirt, should be easily cleanable and should absorb moisture, especially in wet preparation areas. Suitable ceilings can be made of plaster with a smooth continuous lower surface. Insulation material like glass wool or fiberglass should be used in areas where a large amount of steam is generated. In such cases, ceilings should be finished with hard gloss paint. If ceilings are not insulated, the absorbent material used may be plaster, which can be finished with a soft non-washable distemper.\n<br>These surfaces should be renewed every six months. Absorbent surfaces will prevent steam from\ncondensing on the surface and falling back onto food. A high gloss will wear well and light colour will promote good hygiene. All other fittings at ceiling level, like lights, fans, vents and hoods, should be properly fixed leaving no space for dirt to accumulate or pests to breed. They should be easy to clean and well maintained. The ceiling should be free from unnecessary decorations which makes cleaning difficult.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doors\n</b><br>The kitchen, dining area and pantry should preferably have separate ‘in’ and ‘out’ doors. All doors should be rodentproof and self-closing. Full swing doors should have a transparent wired glass panel at eye level or should be strictly used for one-way traffic to prevent collisions. Simplicity in\n<br>design, easy cleanability and well-fitted joints are some desirable features for all doors, They should be fitted with a metal kick plate or easily cleanable finger plate. Sliding-door railings should be kept clean.\n<br>\n<br><b>Windows\n</b><br>Windows should be fly-proof. They should be so planned that there are adequate ventilation and light. Window sills should be waterproof.\n<br>\n<br><b>Staircases and Service Lifts\n</b><br>Staircases should have banister posts and rails of simple design, which are easy to maintain and\nkept in good repair.\n<br>Service lifts should be cleaned every day and the entire lift should be cleaned thoroughly once\na week, taking care to remove food particles and spilled liquids that would otherwise attract pests. The insides of the lift should be made of non-absorbent materials. Spillages, if any, should be mopped up immediately. The lift should be used only for sending cooked food from the kitchen and not for preparing or storing food. Each course should be placed in a separate horizontal compartment with liquids in the lower compartment.\nLarge food lifts are needed when the kitchen is not on the ground floor the lift should not be used for carrying food and refuse at the same time. If food lift have to be used for poop or other goods also, then care should be taken to cover the food or carry it in closed container: Lifts ase for conveying, food and refuse should be kept very clean.\n<br>\n<br><b>VENTILATION\n</b><br>Ventilation is the science of maintaining atmospheric conditions which are comfortable and healthful to the human body.\n<br>\n<br>Adequate ventilation is essential in every room, especially me the Kitchen because of a quantity of food production many high-pressure burners are used resulting in higher temperatures and large amounts of steam, fumes and smoke.<br><b><br></b><b>Ventilation helps in the following ways:\n</b><br>\n<br>1. it makes the workplace comfortable by cooling it\n<br>2. it reduces the chances of accidental fires due to accumulated grease.\n<br>3. it prevents water of condensation from settling on walls and ceilings and dripping onto food.\n<br>4. it keeps the work area clean,\n<br>5. it prevents toxic fumes and gases from accumulating in the kitchen,\n<br>\n<br>To maintain such conditions it is necessary to control the temperature, humidity, air currents and purity of air in the building as well as the surroundings. Foul air should be continuously removed and replaced by fresh air so that the environment is comfortable and free from health hazards.\n<br>\n<br><b>Faulty Ventilation\n</b><br>In overcrowded and poorly ventilated rooms, the air gets polluted because of\n<br>1. an increase in the level of carbon dioxide\n<br>2. increased relative humidity\n<br>3. rise in temperature\n<br>4. air-borne ineffective agents and other air pollutants like smoke\n<br>5. air remaining stagnant\n<br>\n<br>The discomfort is felt not only because of an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide, but mainly because of stagnant air, heat, and humidity. As air loses its cooling power fess heat is lost from the surface of the body, in a poorly ventilated, hot, stuffy, steamy kitchen atmosphere, the following symptoms may be observed in employees; headache, irritability, lassitude, poor concentration, drowsiness, loss of appetite, lowered resistance to respiratory tract infections and increased chances of accidents.\n<br>\n<br>An ill-ventilated workplace not only affects the health and work efficiency of the worker but also promotes the multiplication of harmful microorganisms in food, leading to food spoilage and food poisoning.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Volatile Organic Compounds</i></b> A group of hazardous chemicals that emanate from solvents.\nvarnishes, paints, LPG stoves, pesticides, air fresheners, Incense sticks and newly renovated buildings\nand include chemicals such as benzene, toluene, ethylene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride, etc.\n<br>VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) are a cause of concern in the indoor air in poorly ventilated rooms, VOCs generally detected in indoor air belong to nine groups of compounds, most of which are used as solvents.\n<br>\n<br><b>Sources of VOC Indoors\n</b><br>Benzene and Toluene from LPG stoves and cleansing solvents used in the kitchen and dining area. VOCs are present in thinners and solvents in paints, carpet cleaning solutions, lacquers and varnishes, mothballs and air fresheners, Indoor concentration of benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene is highest in shopping malls and second highest in restaurants.\n<br>Newly painted walls, new floor coverings and newly renovated buildings can emit VOCs for\nup to a few months, Photocopier machines, toner powder, laser printers, matrix printers, mosquito coil smoke, tobacco smoke incense sticks insecticides, dry cleaning, the concentration of xylene is\nhighest in offices.\n<br>Outdoor sources of VOC's are automobile exhaust and traffic-related sources like garages, apart from industrial machinery in which hydrocarbons are incompletely burnt. They enter the building and add to the VOC content in the air.\n<br>Because of a complex mix of health-damaging pollutants that arise indoors and are trigger off by&nbsp;poor ventilation, it is necessary to understand the sources of these VOCs and their effect on health\nand work efficiency.\n<br>\n<br><i>The indoor VOC concentration can be controlled by the following measures:\n</i><br>\n<br>1. Use of exhaust ventilation for high VOC sources.\n<br>2. Use of low emitting materials to finish and furnish interiors.\n<br>3. Use of low emitting cleaning products.\n<br>4. Limiting the usage of products that contain chemicals that are highly reactive to ozone.\n<br>\n<br>Thus, adequate ventilation is a must in each room and all areas in the catering establishment.\n<br>\n<br><b>Systems of Ventilation\n</b><br>There are two systems of ventilation ~ natural and artificial. Artificial ventilation includes exhaust or extraction systems, propulsion systems, and air conditioning systems.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Natural Ventilation</i></b> Natural ventilation is achieved by diffusion of gases and by the effect of differences in temperature by which hot air expands, becomes lighter and rises up and is replaced by cold air and the action of wind currents.\n<br>\n<br>Windows, doors and ventilators provide natural ventilation. Windows should be wire meshed to keep insects, dust and dirt away. The wire mesh should be regularly cleaned. The location of the windows in relation to the work areas is an important factor that needs careful consideration. Windows provide good natural ventilation when the weather is suitable. It is unbearable in extremely cold weather, ineffective by itself in very hot weather and unmanageable in very windy weather.\n<br>\n<br>Natural ventilation is rarely satisfactory by itself for public places where there are a large number of people gathered or where many cooking ranges are being used. It is effective only when there is sufficient open space around the establishment and a large number of windows opening directly into the open, and not in the heart of crowded cities.\nNatural ventilation is effective when the kitchen is located above the ground floor. However, in basement and ground floor kitchens, artificial ventilation is desirable. Louvers or air bricks are more suitable than windows in basement and ground floor kitchens, Ventilators are useful where the ceilings ate high, Such rooms are easier to ventilate than rooms with low ceilings.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. Windows cannot be used for ventilation in certain types of weather, for example, in extreme cold, rainy, windy, or stormy weather.\n<br>2. It may be impossible to position and arrange equipment so that windows can be used for ventilation unless specifically planned.\n<br>3 Open windows used for ventilation allow dust, dirt, flies and other pests into the kitchen.\n<br>4. No form of natural ventilation can keep out bad odours and fumes from the external environment.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Advantages\n</i></b><br>1. Itis cheap.\n<br>2. If windows and doors are placed opposite one another at the same height for cross- ventilation, it can be quite efficient.\n<br>3. It provides light during the daytime.\n<br>\n<br>Ceiling fans, table fans and exhaust fans are extremely useful in hot, humid, close kitchens. Fans help agitate the air, cause evaporation and make one feel comfortable. They help circulate the air by forcing the foul air out. They are useful where humidity is high and the air is still. However, ceiling fans and table fans cannot be used when the gas burners are on.\n<br>\n<br><b>Artificial Ventilation</b> This has to be resorted to where natural ventilation is not practical or where climatic conditions do not permit free use of open doors and windows and a large number of\npeople work for a considerably long period. In such cases, mechanical means are used to facilitate renewal of air. They can be regulated according to the needs.\n<br>Ideally, ventilation of the kitchen should be separate from the rest of the building. The simplest form&nbsp;of artificial ventilation consists of an injector fan fitted with a filter that allows pure air to enter and an extractor fan at the other end of the room. The fans may be thermostatically controlled. The vent\noutlets should be as high as possible on the walls. The inlet should not be near the refuse dump, sanitary conveniences, coal chute or any dirty or dusty place. The vent outlets should not create a nuisance for other people. The vent pipe should be fixed away from the wail, so that cleaning is made easy.\n<br>Adequate artificial ventilation can be achieved by one of the following ways:\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Exhaust or extraction system</i></b> This method is based on mechanical suction or extraction of air out of rooms by creating a vacuum.\n<br>It is used to carry fumes away from the workplace by exhaust fans which are either high-pressure fans or low-pressure fans. This system is popular in the tandoori and barbecue sections of Indian kitchens.\n<br>Exhausts may be general or local.\n<br><i>1. General exhaust: </i>It is recommended only for small operations involving little cooking. An exhaust fan is fitted in the wall to draw out foul air.\n<br><i>2. Local exhaust</i> is done with exhaust hoods or ventilators. They are of two types:\n<br>(a) Conventional hood which hangs at a height of 1.2 m (four feet) over the cooking range and is used for one or more units. This hood is fitted with an exhaust fan.\n<br>(b) Ventilator hood which is usually attached to the unit and is used for that unit only.\n<br>\n<br>Each piece of cooking equipment Should be Provided with adequate ventilation, in the form of suspended hoods, screens and ducts.<br>Ventilation hoods should be designed of hard smooth material like steel or galvanized iron or any metal which will not corrode or rust. It should prevent liquid or grease from collecting and dropping back onto food or food contact surfaces. The hoods should be easy to clean. The size of the hood will depend on the size of the equipment. <br><br>The air ducts should be large enough to allow air to pass freely. It should be placed at a height of\n1.2m (four feet) above the cooking surface. The hoods should be fitted with filters or grease extractors that are detachable. They should be cleaned regularly and inspected every three months. Special attention should be given to canopies over frying and grilling sections, where a lot of grease gets trapped. These filters should be cleaned or renewed at smaller intervals say, fortnightly to prevent fires After trapping the grease, the duct carries foul air to the exterior of the building.\n<br>In this system, a vacuum is created and air that has been removed should be replaced without creating a draught All incoming air must be screened to prevent insects and dirt from entering the premises.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. Extraction of air from all rooms not uniform. \n<br>2. Although suitable inlets are provided, It’s very difficult to regulate incoming air.\n<br>3. Air may be sucked in through undesirable places such as toilets, etc.\n<br>4. Heating and cooling of the incoming air are not possible.\n<br>\n<br>In many areas in the United States, clean air ordinances demand that exhausted a with high levels of smoke, grease and food odor should be purified before its released.&nbsp; <br><i>Propulsion system Ventilation </i>is achieved by propelling or forcing, clean air into a room by using revolving fans or blowers under pressure.\nThe air which is forced in is washed, filtered, warmed or cooled and humidified. The air, however,\nloses its freshness because it is treated. The inlets are installed at low levels near the floor, All doors and windows are kept closed. This system is not suitable for kitchens as undesirable fumes, steam and smoke are not removed. It can be used in restaurants and other public areas.\n<br>\n<br><i>Air conditioning or combined system</i> This is a combination of exhaust or extraction and propulsion system and it is the most satisfactory method of artificial ventilation. This principle is made use of in air conditioners where air, under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, is driven into the room by means of a fan through duets at a height of about 2m (seven ft.) from the floor,\n<br>\n<br>Used air is extracted from the room through an outlet at the floor level. If this system has to work effectively, there should be no leakage of air through doors and windows. The temperature of air should be 21°C (70°F) and humidity should be 60 percent in tropical countries. \n<br>\n<br><b><i>Advantages of artificial ventilation</i></b> \n<br>1. Air can be filtered, humified, warmed, or cooled before it is allowed to enter the building. \n<br>2. Air can be delivered at any level and the rate of airflow can be controlled.\n<br>3. When the level of pollution by smoke, gases, or fumes is high, natural ventilation alone cannot be depended upon. Itis then mandatory that each machine has an air extraction cover.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages of artificial ventilation \n</i></b><br>1. It requires skilled supervision and maintenance.\n<br>2. The position of exhaust fans, vents and ducts should be included in the construction plans.\n<br>3. It is expensive.\n<br>4. A drought of fresh air is always more refreshing and invigorating,\n<br>\n<br><b>EN-CONDITIONING&nbsp;</b><br>\n<br>This is a new concept to revive indoor air quality (IAQ). The air quality in closed spaces is known\nto be more harmful than open spaces and poorly ventilated rooms are known to spread respiratory\ninfections, congestion, colds, flu, itchy eyes, headaches and sleeplessness.\n<br>To purify the air in closed spaces, en-conditioning technology was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide a pathogen and pollutant-free environment. It is based on a photo catalytic oxidation system that is useful in commercial spaces,\n<br>\n<br>1. In fruit and vegetable storage areas and in warehouses it can be used to extend the shelf life and curb losses due to decay by removing ethylene gas, which is produced during the ripening process, and which further hastens ripening.\n<br>2. All airborne microorganisms are destroyed by combining the effects of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and photo-catalytic oxidation (PCO). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as the photo-catalyst. No filters are required and when TiO2, is irradiated with UV right, strong oxidizing agents called hydroxide radicals and super oxide ions are formed. The filter-less technology traps particles and breaks them up into vapors leaving almost no residue. The technology is completely green as it is ozone-free, and can keep the air 99.99% pure. It has been tested in various hospitals and guest rooms and has reduced infection-causing viruses, bacteria, mold, and fungi. It reduces bio-burden by 85% in 72 hours.\n<br>3. It cleans the air of contaminants, allergens and removes unpleasant odors from closed spaces.\n<br>4. It removes mold and mold spores that eat away expensive fabrics, upholstery, carpets, wall coverings and furnishings.\n<br>5. The air in cold storage units can be sterilized as it is effective at low temperatures of 5°C to 0°C, thus increasing the shelf life of raw, semi-processed and processed food. \n<br>\n<br>In the hospitality industry, it could be used in cold storage areas, hotel rooms, restaurants, banquets and other public areas and can significantly reduce the level of harmful airborne pathogens, allergens, contaminants, ethylene gas and odors. Airocide is one such enconditioner.\n<br>\n<br><b>LIGHTING\n</b><br>Good lighting is essential in the kitchen and food storage areas because\n<br>1. It helps the workers to see what they are doing clearly \n<br>2. Dirt or spoilage becomes more conspicuous\n<br>3. It facilitates cleaning.\n<br>4. It increases safety by preventing accidents\n<br>5. It improves the overall quality and quantity of work.\n<br>\n<br>Lighting may be natural or artificial. In most establishments, artificial lighting is required to supplement natural lighting even during the day. There should be no gloomy corners or passages where dirt is likely to collect. Light-colored walls and ceilings reflect light and increase the amount of illumination. The window area should be one-fifth of the floor area to provide sufficient natural light in the room. Sinks and food preparation areas situated near or under windows get sufficient natural light during the day. Natural light should be made use of as far as possible as it is economical and good for health. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight have germicidal properties.\n<br>\n<br><b>Artificial Lighting\n</b><br>Artificial lighting is of two types: light produced by combustion and light produced by an electric\ncurrent.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Light Produced by Combustion</i></b> Substances that burn with a flame gives out light and heat. They use up oxygen from the air and contaminate it with waste substances. Nowadays, such lighting is used during power failure only or in remote areas where there is no electricity.\n<br>The common forms of this type of lighting are candles, paraffin lamps and gas lights.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. It causes the blackening of walls. \n<br>2 Such lighting emits a slight smell because of incomplete combustion and there are chances of carbon monoxide formation. By-products are harmful.\n<br>3. More labor and maintenance are required for these lights.\n<br>4. The Light is insufficient and the flame flickers.\n<br>5. It produces heat and there is the risk of fire.\n<br>6. More ventilation is required as oxygen is used up.\n<br><b><i><br></i></b><br><b><i>Advantages</i></b> \n<br>It is useful in emergencies like power failure.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Light Produced by Electricity</i></b> Light produced by an electric current does not contaminate the air. As there is no combustion. oxygen is not used up and waste is not produced. It produces very little heat.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Advantages\n</i></b><br>1. It is convenient to use.\n<br>2 There is no fear of contamination.\n<br>3. No flicker is produced; the light is steady and uniform.\n<br>4. Minimum heat is produced.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Disadvantages\n</i></b><br>1. Power failure causes total blackout.\n<br>2 There is the risk of shock if electrical fittings and fixtures are not well maintained or are handled carelessly.\n<br>\n<br>Electric lighting used in catering establishments is of three types: tungsten filament bulbs, fluorescent tubes, and sodium vapor lamps. A tungsten filament bulb consists of a wire filament suspended in an inert gas. Such bulbs are available in clear as well as pearl or milky variety.\nIn a fluorescent tube, an electric current passes through mercury gas which acts on the fluorescent lining of the tube and causes it to glow. These tubes are cheaper and more efficient than tungsten filament bulbs. A tube lasts for up to 5,000 hours and a bulb lasts for only 1,000 hours. They are preferred because of economical consumption of electric energy. Tubes are suitable in the kitchen because they produce an even spread of shadow less light and very little glare. This light is comfortable to work in and increases work efficiency. Sometimes, fluorescent tubes may change the colour of the food. This problem can be effectively minimized by changing the tube or the shade or by adding more fixtures.\n<br>Sodium vapor lamps also last longer than tungsten bulbs. They use less energy but provide much more light than fluorescent tubes.\n<br>\n<br><b>Location and Amount of Light\n</b><br>Light should be from a good source and adequate light should fall on all work areas especially food preparation tables and sinks. There should be no glare or flicker. A constant, uniform source of light with minimum shadow is desirable.\n<br>\n<br>The location of lighting fixtures should be considered carefully. A number of small points of illumination usually produce less glare than one large point. Lights should give a clear view of the interiors of all equipment like cooking ranges, ovens, etc. Lighting is measured in terms of lux per\nmeter, i.e., the amount of illumination falling on a surface of | m at table height, approximately 75cms (30 inches) above floor level.\n<br>\n<br>The amount of lighting recommended in different areas is:\n<br>1. Food storage area: 150 to 200 lux\n<br>2. Food preparation, serving, and wash-up areas: 200 to 500 lux\n<br>3. Dining or service area: as dim as desired, normally 200 lux\n<br>Indirect light is best reflected from the ceiling,\n<br>\n<br><b>Light Fittings\n</b><br>In general, light fittings should be easy to clean and should be corrosion-resistant. All fittings should be well maintained and in good repair. Electric bulbs should be enclosed in unbreakable white translucent globes and tube lights should be protected with a protective sleeve or cover, to prevent broken glass from contaminating food or food contact surfaces. Electric wires should be placed or fitted in such a way that they do not harbour dirt or insects and are easy to clean. Switches and bulb holders should be made of plastic, as kitchen walls may be steamy and damp. Average lighting conditions require one to four watts per square feet area.\n<br>\n<br><b>Faulty Lighting\n</b><br>Insufficient lighting reduces output and has several ill effects on health. A poorly lit room causes headache, eyestrain, bad posture, irritability, and increases the chances of accidents. Workers are slack and untidy in their work. Thus, the total quality, as well as quantity of work done, is affected.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It protects the wearer from injury due to blunt impacts, electrical hazards, heat, chemicals and more. Each workplace uses different types of protective clothing, from goggles and lab coats to safety boots and hard hats, and employers have basic duties concerning the provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at work to protect their staff.\n<br>\n<br><b>PPE FOR THE FOOD AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY\n</b><br>Much like construction workers, kitchen and hospitality staff need to be protected from their working environment. From chefs to cleaners, there are many tasks that can cause injury at work.\n<br>\n<br><b>Why Wear Protective Clothing In The Kitchen?\n</b><br>Kitchens are hot, busy and dangerous places to work. Hot ovens, open fires, and sharp knives all add to the risk of injury. Even to the most experienced chefs. Wearing PPE when working in a kitchen helps you to prevent injury by protecting you from burns, cuts and more.\n<br>\n<br><b>Why Wear Protective Clothing When Working With Food?\n</b><br>Wearing protective clothing when preparing and cooking food helps to protect both your customers and yourself. Food-safe gloves and hairnets help you to hygienically prepare food and prevent foreign objects from falling into food. Clean aprons, gloves, towels and more will help you to hygienically prepare food, protecting your customers from food poisoning or injury. Clothing can also help to protect you from injury when working with food too. But what clothing do you need?\n<br>\n<br>“More of protective clothing than uniform.” The Kitchen uniform consists of the following:\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Toque/Headwear\n</i></b><br>• Keeps the head cool and prevents the hair from falling into the food.\n<br>• Cotton/cloth caps are difficult to maintain whereas, paper caps are disposable hence they are neat.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Scarf/Neckerchief\n</i></b><br>• Absorbs sweat.\n<br>• Identification/designation.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Double-breasted jacket\n</i></b><br>• Protects the chest and front.\n<br>• Easy to remove overhead or sideways.\n<br>• Cotton cloth buttons – heat resistant.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Apron\n</i></b><br>• Below-knee level.\n<br>• Double protection prevents the jacket &amp; trousers from becoming dirty.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Cotton checked trousers\n</i></b><br>• Double shade hides the dirt.\n<br>• Identifies designation.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Shoes and Socks\n</i></b><br>• Clogs can be used but it is expensive\n<br>• Metal frame in front protects the toes.\n<br>• Easy to remove legs.\n<br>• Socks\n<br>• Absorbs sweat.\n<br>• Provides good grip.\n<br>• Steady steps while walking\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Slipbuster Safety Boots\n</i></b><br>Kitchen footwear is also designed to keep you safe. Many have a non-slip construction to ensure you can stay on your feet, even when the floors are slippery. There are three different types of certification for non-slip footwear;\n<br>\n<br>SRA - tested on ceramic tile, wetted with a dilute soap solution\n<br>SRB - tested on smooth steel with glycerol\n<br>SRC - tested under both the above conditions\n<br>\n<br>Slipbuster footwear has SRC non-slip soles that make them perfect for use in commercial kitchens. Some slipbuster shoes are called ‘safety boots’ or ‘safety shoes’. They are made from strong materials, such as leather, to offer extra ankle support and protection against falling equipment and utensils.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Cut-resistant gloves</i></b> offer protection for your hands whilst you prepare foods. Great for training or for cutting unusually tough produce with razor-sharp knives; cut-resistant gloves are essential in every kitchen.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Oven gloves</i></b> will protect your hands from hot cookware when using ovens and other cooking equipment. Their heat-resistant construction makes it safe for you to remove baking trays, dishes, and other cookware from ovens without burning your hands. Blue vinyl gloves offer protection from certain foods too. Some foods, such as hot chilies, can cause irritation if handled without gloves.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHAT PROTECTIVE CLOTHING SHOULD BE WORN WHEN CLEANING?\n</b><br>Commercial cleaning chemicals can be dangerous if not used correctly or if you’re not wearing the right protective equipment. Strong acids can damage skin and eyes, so wearing the right protective clothing and equipment is crucial to maintaining safety.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Safety goggles </i></b>are the best way to protect your eyes from accidental splashes of cleaning fluids. They are made from strong plastics and rubbers that make them comfortable to wear whilst giving you reliable protection. Goggles offer more protection when using chemicals as they have a surround that hugs your face, leaving no gaps for liquids to get in. Our safety goggles conform to the European standards for eye protection (EN166).\n<br>\n<br>Cleaning staff should also use rubber gloves to protect their skin from burns and irritation. These are available in a range of lengths and thicknesses to offer different levels of protection. Color-coded gloves are perfect for washing up and light-duty cleaning, whilst long length, heavy duty gloves are great for use with strong chemicals or tricky cleaning tasks such as cleaning ovens.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Waterproof aprons</i></b> prevent damage to your clothing and add a layer of protection on top of your lab coat or overalls. They are available in both heavy and light duty variations for different tasks and environments; from washing dishes to bleaching floors. You can also use tabards rather than waterproof aprons. These often come with pockets for storing cleaning equipment, such as cloths and sprays. These aren’t waterproof, however, so are best suited to general cleaning duties such as dusting, polishing and vacuuming.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING PROTECTIVE CLOTHING\n</b><br>When deciding what protective clothing you and your staff will need to use for each task, you should consider;\n<br>\n<br>* What hazards do the tasks present? Knowing the hazards that come with each task will help you to plan which clothing and/or equipment you should use. For example, if you know there will be harmful chemicals, consider splashing and skin contact.\n<br>* Is it suitable for the conditions? Make sure the clothing you choose is suitable for the working conditions and environment.\n<br>* Does it offer the right level of protection? Choose the clothing and equipment that adequately protects the wearer.\n<br>* Do you and your staff need training on the items or do the items require maintenance? Ensure your staff knows how to fit and wear the items properly to ensure maximum safety.\n<br>* Do you know when/if/how the items need replacing? Knowing how to clean, repair, or replace worn-out safety clothing is crucial to keeping your staff protected.\n<br>* Before you and your staff get started using your new protective clothing, you should consider the following questions;\n<br>* Do the items fit properly? Wearing protective clothing that is too big can make tasks more difficult, so make sure each item fits correctly before use.\n<br>* How do they feel? Is the wear suitably comfortable? The wearer can become distracted if the clothing is not comfortable, which increases the risk of accidents.\n<br>* Does the protective clothing interfere with the task at hand? Thick gloves can make more intricate cleaning tasks more difficult; ensure all clothing is suitable for the task at hand.\n<br>* Does the protective clothing create extra hazards, such as overheating or entanglement? Long aprons can get on equipment and machinery. Ensure the protective clothing and equipment don’t create any further hazards for you and your staff.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

They should be able to\n<br>Withstand continuous contact with food, water, cleaning agents, sanitisers and heat. Meat blocks, chopping boards and tandoors are an exception and will be dealt with separately.\n<br>While selecting equipment, certain standards need to be kept in mind.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Functional:</b> It should do the job for which it is intended with maximum efficiency. It is desirable if there are less number of parts required for efficient functioning of the equipment.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Easy to clean:</b> It should be easy to disassemble and reassemble. All parts should be accessible for cleaning. The parts should be easily reached and so constructed that dirt, food residue and cleaning material does not get logged in them.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Durable:</b> The material used should not dent, buckle, pit or chip and should be able to Withstand heavy wear and tear. Stainless steel and kadappa are most durable and ideally suited for work surfaces in catering establishments.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Sooth and sealed surfaces:</b> Cracks, crevices, open spaces and holes are likely to hide microorganisms, pests, dirt, and food particles,. and allow liquids to accumulate. Such surfaces are practically impossible to clean. All joints and seams in utensils, equipment, food areas and wash up areas should be sealed, for example, hollow handles on pots and Pans and faulty insulation in urness is undesirable.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Closed:</b> In non-food areas, all openings should be closed, i.e. an opening of 0.8 mm or less is considered closed. This opening is not large enough to harbour pests or collect dirt.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Rounded corners and edges:</b> Internal corners or edges should be covered or rounded off and external surfaces should have dosed, soldered corners or edges.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Non-toxic: </b>Coating material used on a food contact surface should be nontoxic. Lead-based paints and some sealers are not permitted in the food area. Coating material should be hardy. It should not chip or crack by normal handling. Single service articles, plastics or disposables should be made from non-toxic, food grade material.\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Non-absorbent: </b>Material used should not impart taste, colour or flavour to food and should not react with any food ingredient or cleaning agent. Old equipment may become absorbent, and may retain food odours.\n<br>\n<br><b>9. Safe:</b> Electrical fittings should be well protected, sealed, water and shockproof and should not trail across floors or gangways.\n<br>\n<br><b>10. Corrosion resistant: </b>Material used should maintain its original quality and appearance in-spite of repeated exposure to food, liquid, cleaning material, sanitisers, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>11. Conformity: </b>It should always meet the standards set by the regulatory agencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR CLEANING EQUIPMENT\n</b><br>\n<br>For all stationary equipment, follow the manufacturer's instructions for disassembling and cleaning the machine. Some stationary equipment is designed for cleaning-in-place by pumping a detergent and sanitising solutions through them.\n<br>Although each piece of equipment in the catering establishment will need specific instructions for operating and cleaning, a list of general instructions is given below. From the safety and sanitation aspect it is essential that all employees using the equipment should be familiar with these procedures before cleaning or handling the machine.\n<br>\n<br>1. Read the instructions for operating the equipment as well as the cleaning procedures displayed on the plaque fitted near the machine. It is the responsibility of the management to display all instructions in a prominent place.\n<br>2. Turn the switch to off position and let the unit cool after shutting off gas or electricity.\n<br>3. Drain off or remove all leftover food.\n<br>4. Remove plug from socket.\n<br>5. Disassemble parts for cleaning. Immerse small parts in hot detergent solution and wash in the dishwashing machine if practicable or use suitable cleaning agents and tools. Remove adjustable shelves. Wash, rinse and sanitise all parts to remove all traces of soil by three bucket method. The three bucket method is explained in previous units under the three methods to wash, rinse and sanitise food contact surfaces.\n<br>6. Start cleaning from the top. Use a dry cloth and polish metal surfaces. Clean legs and casters of movable equipment.\n<br>7. Dry all parts thoroughly to prevent rusting, shock or microbial growth.\n<br>8. Reassemble all cleaned and dried parts.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>INSTALLATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF EQUIPMENT\n</b><br>Equipment should be arranged in such a way that it is easy to operate, does not hamper the flow&nbsp; of work, facilitates easy cleaning as well as protects food from any nearby source of contamination\nlike soiled dishes, garbage bins, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Large Equipment\n</b><br>Large or heavy duty equipment is either permanently mounted on the floor or is mobile with casters fitted underneath. Mobile equipment is gaining popularity because it can be moved by one person and simplifies the cleaning of walls and floors near the equipment. It also permits a change in the overall arrangement.\n<br>It should be easy to disconnect. Utility connections should be flexible and long enough to permit movement while cleaning. Free standing equipment or equipment that is immobile, requiring a number of people to lift it, should be mounted at least 15 cm (six inches) off the floor or permanent, fixed on a well constructed cemented platform, leaving no gaps for pests and dirt. It may also be sealed to the wall or to other equipment. Sufficient pace should be left between the equipment and the wall to permit easy cleaning and create no obstruction in work. If equipment is sealed to the floor, a 2.5 cm (one inch) to 10 cm (four inch) toe space should be left to prevent stubbing toes.\n<br>\n<br><b>Wall Mounted Equipment\n</b><br>Alternatively, equipment may also be mounted on the wall, supported by a sturdy bracket, leaving the floor space clear. A suitable gap should be left between the wall and equipment to allow easy cleaning. The size of the gap will vary with the size of the equipment, and ranges from 15 cms to 45 cms (six to eighteen inches) for floor mounted equipment.\n<br>\n<br><b>Small or Portable Equipment\n</b><br>It is placed on table tops or counter tops. Equipment which is occasionally used, can be stored on racks when not in use. Such equipment is generally light in weight and should be shifted often to keep the gap between rack and equipment clean.\n<br>Heavy counter top equipment should be mounted on legs leaving a 10 cm (four inch) clearance\n<br>between the base of the equipment and top of the counter for ease in cleaning.\n<br>\n<br><b>FOOD PREPARATION SURFACES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Work Tables and Platforms\n</b><br>Food preparation surfaces should be impervious and smooth and so designed that thorough cleaning is possible. Wooden surfaces are not recommended for preparation of food because it is difficult to maintain. Wood absorbs stains and Odors and holds moisture and swells. It encourages the growth of microorganisms and pests, and the surface gets cracked and chipped easily. Wooden surfaces should be Covered with Formica.\n<br>\n<br>Aluminium top tables get dented and pitted and are not as durable as steel. Stainless steel top tables on mild steel stands are recommended. Tables should not be placed against a wall. They should preferably be free standing. Naturally occurring stone, such as kadappa, granite OF marble platforms and work table tops are ideal. T hey are durable and easy to clean. Platforms built into the wall should have edges covered and sealed. The supporting structure of all tables should be easy to clean.\n<br>\n<br><b>MATERIALS USED FOR MAKING LARGE AND SMALL EQUIPMENT'S\n</b><br><i><b>Stainless steel:</b> </i>This is an alloy of iron, chromium and nickel. It is relatively non-corrosive and is recommended for use in the kitchen. The thickness or gauge of the stainless steel sheet used will depend on the wear and tear that the equipment or the surface will be subjected to. It is used for tabletops, cooking ranges, sinks, urns, etc. and a wide variety of small equipment.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Galvanised steel and iron:</i></b> This is steel treated with zinc. It has poor wear-ability and sanitary quality as it rusts easily and gathers soil.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Mild steel: </i></b>This is an alloy of iron and carbon. It is used in supporting stands for equipment. Galvanised iron is used as a substitute for mild steel.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Cold rolled steel: </i></b>This is non-corrosive because it has a porcelain fused steel coat.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Cast iron: </i></b>It is ideal for equipment that is to be heated like grills, skillets, griddles, chapati puffer, and woks.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Aluminium: </i></b>It is relatively non-corrosive, non-porous, smooth, lightweight and strong. As it is light it is suitable for mobile equipment. It is a good conductor of heat and is used for cooking utensils like pots, pans and griddles. ISI grade aluminium is permitted for food containers.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Hindalium</i></b>: It is an aluminium alloy with chromium or nickel and is used for making utensils. Aluminium alloys are used for making legs, racks and hoods on equipment. It is not recommended for ovens and cooking ranges as it is not very durable.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Copper:</i></b> It is an excellent conductor of heat, hence, it is used on the outer surface of utensils in contact with the flame or source of heat. Because of its attractive appearance it is used for food Service. In such cases, it should be tin-plated on the inner surface. Acidic foods in contact with Copper can poison food.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Brass: </i></b>It is a good conductor of heat. It is an alloy of copper and zinc. All food contact surfaces should be tin-plated. It is used for making large pots and pans. Maintenance is costly,\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Wood: </i></b>It is popular as a chopping surface as it does not harm the knife blade. It is also used for making pushers for grinding machines. It is light in weight. It has poor wearability and sanitary quality because it absorbs stains, odours and holds moisture.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Polypropylene:</i></b> It is gradually replacing wood and is used in making meat blocks, chopping boards&nbsp; and as pushers in wet grinders. It does not absorb moisture Or retain stains and odours.&nbsp; Polypropylene boards are available in different colors. To prevent cross contamination, select a specific colour for a particular section. The knives used should also have a colour tag. It should be sanitized in 200ppm chlorine solution for 15 minutes.\n<br>\n<br><b>EQUIPMENT REQUIRING SPECIAL ATTENTION \n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>1. Cleaning-in-place equipment:</i></b> Some equipment is SO designed that it can be cleaned by circulating a cleaning and sanitising solution through the entire system. The solution cleans all food contact surfaces. This equipment should be self-draining and should leave no residue of cleaning liquid inside the machine. Some hand-operated beverage dispensers and automatic ice-making machines are cleaned in this way. \n<br>\n<br><b><i>2. Microwave ovens:</i></b> They should be checked to ensure that no excessive high frequency emission is occurring, as this could be an invisible health hazard. Food to be heated should not be placed in metal containers or left indefinitely in the oven.\n<br>Microwave ovens are also used to thaw frozen foods. Once thawed, such foods should be cooked immediately. Cleaning procedure should be strictly as per manufacturer's instructions.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>3. Refrigerators and freezers:</i></b> They should be so constructed that they are easy to clean. Cleaning&nbsp;procedures are explained in the previous unit under ‘Refrigerated Store’.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>4. Dishwashers, sinks, ware tables and drain boards:</i></b> Dishwashing machines should work efficiently and should also be easy to clean and maintain. Piping to and from machines should be short in order to prevent loss of heat. The machine should be installed at least 15 cm (Six inches) above the ground to facilitate easy cleaning beneath the machine.\n<br>sinks, ware tables and drain boards should have a slope of 1 cm (1/8th inch) per metre to prevent collection of water and hasten drying. Other details have been discussed in previous units under Manual and Machine dishwashing.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>5. Vending machines: </i></b>These machines should be cleaned daily as per manufacturers’ instructions.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>6. Chopping boards and meat blocks: </i></b>They are traditionally made of absorbent materials like wood. Wooden boards and blocks develop cracks, criss-crosses on the surface and rough edges and they may chip. All such surfaces can harbour microorganisms and contaminate the food being chopped. Particles of wood may also get into food. To prevent this from occurring, the surface should be evened regularly and the wood used must be of a hard non-absorbent Variety. It should not contain toxic substances or impact any odor or taste to food. It should also be seamless. Wooden block and boards are being replaced by hard rubber and polypropylene. Wooden boards and blocks should be cleaned immediately after use. The surface should be wiped clean, brushed with a wire brush and Scrubbed clean with a cleaning solution. <br>\n<br><b><i>7. Tandoor:</i></b> Also called the clay oven, it should be fitted with a hood and exhaust fan to remove smoke and prevent soot from collecting. It can be tiled with ceramic tiles on the outside for easy maintenance. As it is traditionally operated on coal, all accumulated ash should be removed daily. It needs to be replaced every three to four month as cracks develop inside the tandoor and it may break.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Some of the foods are consumed as such while others are subjected to some processing including cooking and storage before they are eaten. Some of the constituents of foods enhance nutritive value while others, created during processing or added intentionally, decrease the nutritional value or are toxic. The safety of the foods is of utmost significance and has gained worldwide attention. In western industrialized countries, concerns about safe food have replaced those about adequate food. Many feel that such concerns are a product of our scientific awareness, and corruption in society. The concerns about safe food are definitely not new, but the food safety crisis still exists in several parts of the world including India.\n<br>\n<br>Our food is devitalized, colored, filled with chemicals, drugs and synthetic ingredients, polluted by agricultural and environmental chemicals and grown on impoverished land puffed up by the use of chemical fertilizers and other aids. Moreover, the chemicals used in the growing or processing of food are frequently alleged to cause adverse effects in humans or animals.\n<br><br><b>DEFINITION\n</b><br>In any discussion on food safety, some agreed-upon definitions of safety, hazard and toxicity are crucial, since these are basic concepts. Absolute safety is the assurance that damage or injury from the use of a substance is impossible. Foods safe under normal conditions will never qualify for a seal of approval if they are consumed in excessive quantities or used in an unusual manner. Relative-food safety can be defined as the practical certainty that injury or damage will not result from food or ingredients used in a reasonable and customary manner and quantity.\n<br>\n<br>An understanding of food safety is improved by defining two other basic concepts, toxicity and hazard. Toxicity is the capacity of a substance to produce harm or injury of any kind under any conditions. Hazard is the relative probability that harm or injury will result when the substance is used in a proposed manner and quantity. Assessments of whether a food-or ingredient is safe should not be based on its inherent toxicity but on whether or not a hazard is created.\n<br>\n<br><b>FOOD SAFETY ISSUES\n</b><br>Specific food safety concerns differ markedly and include:\n<br>● Additives, colors and flavors\n<br>● Drug residues\n<br>● Fertilizers and other growing aids\n<br>● Irradiation\n<br>● Microbiological contamination\n<br>● Naturally occurring food toxicants\n<br>● Pesticides\n<br>● Pollutants\n<br>● Processing packaging and labeling\n<br>● Adulteration and misbranding\n<br>\n<br>Consumers are most concerned about pesticides and additives as both are linked in the consumer's mind to cancer. It is also interesting, perhaps even alarming, that most consumers are not concerned about microbiological contamination, despite solid evidence that, of all the hazards, it is the one most likely to occur. Many homes have unsafe food storage and preparation practices. Consumers rarely consider their own food practices a hazard. Food\n<br>\n<br>Industry, however, is most concerned about the microbiological safety of its products. In addition, many quality control checks are made to ensure that foods are free of extraneous matter such as glass, machine fillings and insect parts. Large food companies in many parts of the world adhere to a code of manufacturing practice known as 'Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)'. This code helps to assure that products are manufactured under conditions of proper storage and sanitation. Many also employ an elaborate system known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) to make sure that there is no chance of contamination or error during processing.\n<br>\n<br><b>FACTORS AFFECTING FOOD SAFETY\n</b><br>\n<br>Food hazards are the factors, which are the biggest threat to food safety. A hazard is defined as a biological, chemical, or physical agent in food, or condition of food, with the potential to cause an adverse health effect.\n<br>\n<br><b>Biological hazards</b> are living organisms, including microbiological organisms, bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical hazards</b> are in two categories: naturally occurring poisons and chemicals or deleterious substances. The first group covers natural constituents of foods that are not the result of environmental, agricultural, industrial or other contamination. Examples are aflatoxins and shellfish poisons. The second group covers poisonous chemicals or deleterious substances, which are intentionally or unintentionally added to foods at some point in the food chain. This group of chemicals can include pesticides and fungicides and well lubricants and cleaners.\n<br>\n<br><b>A physical hazard</b> is any physical material not normally found in food, which causes illness or injury. Physical hazards include glass, wood, stones and metal, which may cause illness and injury.

There are many microorganisms, which are pathogenic in humans, but relatively few are associated with foods (Examples in Table ). Those that cause diseases are termed food-borne pathogens. Diseases caused by these organisms are sometimes incorrectly called food poisonings. There are two types of food-borne disease from microbial pathogens: infections and intoxications. Infections result from the ingestion of live pathogenic organisms, which multiply within the body and produce disease. Intoxications occur when toxins produced by pathogens are consumed. Intoxications can occur even if no viable microorganisms are ingested. This often occurs when foods are stored under conditions, which allow the pathogens to grow and produce toxins. Subsequent processing of the food may destroy the microorganisms but not the toxin.\n<br>Hazardous Microorganisms and Parasites along with their commonly implicated foods.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

These materials can become part of foods from the natural environment in which they are grown or they may be contaminated during processing and packaging. Small pieces of metal can come loose from processing machinery, for example. For this reason, many food-processing operations have an electronic metal detector, which screens each package for metals. Foreign / extraneous objects represent one of the largest categories of complaints by consumers. All substances within each of the above five categories can be thought of as carrying some degree of health risk because no food is completely risk-free. The acceptability of each risk will depend on a number of factors, including the alternatives available, cost, benefit, and size of the actual risk. It is the job of the government and industry to ensure that these risks are minimal and acceptable.\n<br>\n<br><b>Chemical Hazards\n</b><br>Chemicals, which cause a harmful response when consumed by animals or humans, are said to be toxic. It turns out that almost everything is a toxicant or \"poison\" if consumed at a high enough level. Even table salt and vitamins are toxic in large amounts. Thus, nearly everything can be considered a \"toxicant\" without regard for the origin of the substance. The factors, which determine toxicity, are the dose or amount of exposure and the potency of the chemical. Acute toxicants act within short periods after exposure (minutes, hours, days), whereas chronic toxicants produce an adverse effect after longer periods, often years. Food-borne toxicants can be divided into three categories:\n<br>\n<br>● Those coming from natural sources, including the food itself. Naturally occurring toxicants are found in plants, microorganisms, and animals. We have learned to avoid foods, which contain naturally occurring acute toxicants. In other cases, we process foods in order to remove the toxicant.\n<br>\n<br>However, it is clear that many foods also contain low levels of naturally occurring chronic toxicants. It is unknown if these naturally occurring chronic toxicants pose any risk for human health.\n<br>\n<br>● Toxic metals become food contaminants because of the way in which foods are grown, produced, processed, stored, or prepared. Toxic environmental contaminants like lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pyrolysis products from cooking are examples of unintended toxicants in foods. Most of these toxicants are in trace amounts and do not pose an acute risk. Often there is little we can do to control these toxicants except to limit the amount of some foods eaten or limit the amount of toxicant permitted in food. As with naturally occurring toxicants, the size of the risk involved from these contaminants is often unknown.\n<br>\n<br>● Food chemicals are intentionally added to foods for some desirable function. This may be a food additive, which acts as a preservative, or it may be a pesticide, which is used to reduce insect, or mold damage or it may be a drug, which is used to treat disease in food-producing animals. These intentional additives are often the most controversial. Some feel that they should not be used no matter how small the risk, whereas others feel the risks are very small and the benefits large. Because we have control over intentional additives, governments around the world closely regulate them. Natural as well as highly processed foods contain chemicals, which can be toxic at some dose. Many types of toxicity can occur from food substances, including nerve damage, organ toxicity, anti-nutritional effects, birth defects, and cancer. Our bodies cannot tell if a toxicant comes from natural sources or if it is synthetic. The body treats both similarly.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Chemical Hazards\n<br></b>\n<br><b><i>Naturally Occurring Chemicals\n</i></b><br>● Mycotoxins (e.g., Aflatoxins)\n<br>● Scombrotoxin (Histamine)\n<br>● Ciguatoxin\n<br>● Mushroom toxins\n<br>● Shellfish toxins\n<br><b>*&nbsp;</b>Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)\n<br><b>*&nbsp;</b>Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP)\n<br><b>*&nbsp;</b>Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP)\n<br><b>*&nbsp;</b>Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP)\n<br>● Pyrrolizidine and other alkaloids\n<br>● Phytohemagglutinin\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Added Chemicals\n</i></b><br>● Agricultural chemicals\n<br>Pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers, antibiotics and growth hormones\n<br>● Toxic elements and compounds\n<br>Lead, arsenic, mercury, cyanide, cadmium, tin and aluminum\n<br>\n<br><b>Food additives (beyond permissible limits) and non-permitted food additives\n</b><br>Because most foods are grown in an open environment, they can become contaminated with natural and human-derived environmental toxicants. Lead, in most cases, is one such toxicant. PCBs, dioxin, and other pollutants resulting from human activity are further examples. In addition to environmental pollutants, foods become contaminated with trace toxicants, which are unintentionally or intentionally added to foods. The use of pesticides to control insects, unwanted plants, or fungi can result in trace residues of the pesticide in the food. In some cases, components of packaging materials migrate from the package to foods. Oils from processing machinery or other processing aids can leave trace residuals in foods. These substances are sometimes called processing aids and are regulated for safety.\n<br>Traces of drugs, which are given to food-producing animals to treat diseases in these animals or make them grow more quickly, could, under some circumstances, remain in the food. Traces of antibiotics in milk are one example. These are also considered trace toxicants.\n<br>\n<br><b>IMPORTANCE OF SAFE FOODS\n</b><br>A safe food supply that will not endanger consumer health and good quality food is essential for proper nutrition. It would ensure the prevention of foodborne diseases, provide consumers with unadulterated food of good quality. It also promotes participation in International trade in food products and stimulates economic development.\n<br>\n<br>Maintaining food safety and quality is essential in the entire chain of food products ranging from i) primary food production at the level of farmers; ii) primary food processing at the farm, dairy, abattoir, and grain mills; iii) secondary food processing level such as canning, freezing, drying and brewing; iv) food distribution, both at National and International level of import/export; v) Food retailing and Food catering and also vi) Domestic Food preparation level.\n<br>\n<br>During recent years newer challenges such as globalization of trade in food, urbanization, changes in lifestyle, international travel, environmental pollution, deliberate adulteration and natural and man-made disasters have arisen which need to be addressed to help ensure food safety and quality. For example, a greater number of people go out and eat meals in catering establishments including partaking in street foods. The boom in food service establishments is not matched by effective food safety education and control.\n<br>\n<br>Unhygienic preparation of food provides plenty of opportunity for contamination, growth, or survival of foodborne pathogens. Also, considerable public interest, especially in the developed countries has been shown with regard to genetically modified food, and the possible risk of transmission of “mad cow” disease through the consumption of beef.\n<br>\n<br>Food safety is concerned with acute and chronic hazards that make food injurious to the health of the consumer. The term Food quality refers to attributes that influence a product’s value to the consumer. This includes both negative attributes such as spoilage, contamination, adulteration, food safety hazards and positive attributes such as the origin, color flavor, texture.  Food hygiene refers to all conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of food at all stages of the food chain.\n<br>\n<br>Consumer confidence in the Safety and Quality of the food supply is an important requirement and consumers are demanding protection for the whole food supply chain from primary producer to the end consumer, often described as from farm or pond to the plate approach.\n<br>\n<br>It is absolutely essential for countries to protect the safety and quality of their foods entering international trade. Also, it is necessary to ensure that imported foods are of good quality and safe to eat. The new World order and the global environment for food trade place a considerable obligation on the part of both importing and exporting countries to ensure the safety and quality of food.\n<br>\n<br>Education and Training play an important role in improving the safety and quality of food. It is essential to acquire the know-how and skills necessary to understand and manage food safety hazards. Both education and training are needed for this purpose. While education aims at influencing the way of life and empowering people to make a choice, training is a process by which one is enabled to acquire a skill.\n<br>\n<br>Successful Food Safety programs need a shared responsibility among producers, industry, trade, government and the consumer. Food safety management has progressed rapidly in recent years. International agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization as well as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, with a membership of 165 countries, recommends a risk analysis approach that includes risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. Risk assessment is the scientific evaluation of known or potential adverse health effects resulting from human exposure to foodborne hazards. It involves identification and characterization of a hazard, and assessment of how likely it is that a health effect will result. Risk management is the process of weighing policy alternatives for accepting, minimizing or reducing risks, and selecting and implementing appropriate options. Risk communication is the exchange of information and opinions concerning risk and risk-related factors among risk assessors, risk managers and other interested parties.\n<br><br>The perception of what constitutes a risk depends on a person’s culture, education and past experience. But while what is perceived as risk may differ, the basic scientific principles for dealing with risk are the same. Risk communication, as a component of health education in food safety, consists of understanding consumers’ perceptions of food safety risks and disseminating the results of risk assessment and decisions regarding risk management. The latter may include measures that governments or industries have to implement or practices that the public as consumers or food handlers should observe.\n<br>\n<br>An integrated approach to food safety and quality facilitates improved consumer protection, reduces the incidence of foodborne diseases, effectively stimulates agriculture and the food processing industry, and promotes domestic and international food trade and improves the economy. Preventive approaches for improving the safety and quality of food and enhancing food hygiene are gaining widespread acceptance. Promoting good manufacturing practices, educating food retailers and consumers about appropriate food handling is essential for promoting good nutrition and better health.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It has, therefore, empowered several agencies and promulgated a number of acts and orders to control this menace. Agencies and institutions have also been created to lay down standards for the quality of foods. The manner in which the food is processed and packaged is also covered by a number of regulations.\n<br>\n<br><b>PREVENTION OF FOOD ADULTERATION ACT (PFA ACT)\n</b><br>One of the early acts to be promulgated in this connection was the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954, which has been in force since June 1, 1955. The objective of this act was to ensure that food articles sold to the customers are pure and wholesome. It also intended to prevent fraud or deception and encourages fair trade practices. The act was amended in 1964, 1976 and again in 1986 in the light of experience gained, to plug loopholes of escape in the Act and to ensure stringent punishment for those indulging in this nefarious practice. The act prohibits the manufacture, sale and distribution of not only adulterated food but also foods contaminated with microorganisms and toxicants and misbranded foods. P.F.A. also specifies microbial standards for pasteurized milk, milk powder, skimmed milk powder, infant milk food, tomato sauce, jam, malted milk food and aflatoxin for groundnut etc.\n<br>A central food laboratory established under the Act is located at Calcutta for the purpose of reporting on suspected food products. The Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, has been recognized as another laboratory for the testing of adulterated foods for the Southern Regions. “ A central committee for food standard” has been constituted under the Act and has been charged with the function of advising the Central Government on matters relating to the Food standards. Provision has been made in the Act for the appointment of Food Inspector by the State Governments and their powers have been defined. The State Government will set up a food testing laboratory and will appoint Public Analysts with adequate staff to report on suspected foods.\n<br>According to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated.\n<br><br>● If the article sold be a vendor is not of nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser and is to his prejudice, or is not of nature, the substance of quality which it purports or is represented to be.\n<br>● If the article contains any other substance which affects, or if the article is so processed as to affect injuriously nature, substance or quality thereof.\n<br>● If any inferior or cheaper substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the article, so as to affect injuriously nature, as substance or quality thereof.\n<br>● If any constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted so as to affect injuriously nature, as a substance or quality thereof.\n<br>● If the article had been prepared, packed or kept under unsanitary conditions whereby it has been contaminated or injurious to health.\n<br>● If the article consists wholly or in part of any filthy, putrid, disgusting, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal or vegetable substance or is insect-infested or otherwise unfit for human consumption.\n<br>● If the article is obtained from a diseased animal.\n<br>● If the article contains any poisonous or any ingredient which renders its contents injurious to health.\n<br>● If the container of the article is composed, whether wholly or in part of any poisonous or deleterious which renders its contents injurious to health.\n<br>● If any coloring matter other than that prescribed in respect thereof and in amounts, not within the prescribed limits of variability is present in the article.\n<br>● If the article contains any prohibited preservative or permitted preservative in excess of the prescribed limits.\n<br>● If the quality or purity of the article falls below the prescribed standard or its constituents are present in quantities that are in excess of the prescribed limits of variability.\n<br>\n<br><b>Administrative hierarchy\n</b><br>The Food Health Authority is appointed at the state level who is the Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. He is responsible for the good quality and standards of foods available to the consumers. Under FHA, there is a Local Health Authority appointed in each city, in every state. The Food Inspector is appointed by the Central or State Government by notification in the official gazette. The Food Inspector undergoes a three months training in food inspection and sampling.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Powers of food inspector\n</i></b><b><i><br></i></b><br>● To take a sample of any article from\n<br><b>* </b>any person selling such article\n<br><b>* </b>any person who is in the course of delivering or preparing to deliver such article to a purchaser or consignee\n<br><b>* </b>a consignee after delivering of any such article to him\n<br>\n<br>● To send such as sample for analysis to the Public Analyst (PA) of the local area.\n<br>When the Food Inspector wants to lift suspected food, the shopkeeper must first be told. There should be witnesses present when the Food Inspector lifts the sample. 150g of the sample is necessary to be sent for analysis. 600g of sample is collected usually and sent to Ripon Buildings, Corporation of Madras, or Kings Institute Guindy, Madras or Central Food Laboratory, Calcutta or Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore. There is a sampling procedure to collect the samples and then they have sealed them in a bottle. The sealed bottle has a label on it that has the code number of the Inspector, the address of the shop or location and the date and time of the collection are written.\n<br><br>When individuals doubt adulteration in foodstuffs, they have to inform the Food Health Authority. Samples can be sent for analysis only after getting an order from Food Health Authority. If persons are found guilty of selling such adulterated food, the persons involved can be convicted. The severity of the sentence would depend on the gravity of the offense. For example, a vendor found adulterating the food with ingredients injurious to health would be liable for a much heavier sentence than a vendor involved in only mixing an inferior ingredient not injurious to health\n<br>\n<br><b>ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES ACT, 1954</b>\n<br>The main objective of this Act is to maintain the supply of essential commodities to the public by proper regulation, prevention of the black market and making it available to the public at a reasonable price. A number of control orders have been formulated under this Act. Some of them are\n<br>\n<br>● Fruit Product Order (1955)\n<br>● Sugar Control Order (1966)\n<br>● Meat Products Control Order (1973)\n<br>● Cold Storage Order (1980)\n<br>● Vegetables Oil Product Control Order (1988)\n<br>● Milk and Milk Product Order (1992)\n<br>● Edible Oil Packaging Order (1998),\n<br>\n<br><b>Fruit Products Order\n</b><br>The Government of India promulgated a Fruit order in 1946. In 1955, the order was revised. The Fruit Product order (FPO) lays down statutory minimum standards in respect of the quality of various fruits and vegetable products and processing facilities. Packaging fruits and vegetables of a standard below the minimum prescribed standards is an offense punishable by law. Periodic inspection by government inspectors in the registered establishments is carried out to ensure conformity of standards by processors.\n<br>Manufacture of fruit and vegetable products can be carried out only after a valid license is issued by the licensing officer after himself satisfying with regard to the quality of the product, sanitation, personnel, machinery and equipment, work area as required in the order.\n<br>This order is operated by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries. Licensee is empowered to put the FPO standard mark on the product.\n<br>\n<br><b>Meat Products Order\n</b><br>This makes it illegal to transport meat unless it has been prepared and processed according to the provisions of the order and carries the mark of inspection.\n<br>It provides means to :\n<br>\n<br>● Detect and destroy meat of diseased animals\n<br>● Ensure that the preparation and handling of meat and meat products be conducted in a clean and sanitary manner.\n<br>● Prevent the use of harmful substances in meat foods.\n<br>● See that every cut of meat inspected before sale to ensures its wholesomeness.\n<br>\n<br>The order also lays down rules and conditions for procedures to be adopted for the selection of disease-free animals, slaughterhouse practices for further treatment of the meat so as to maintain the meat in a wholesome manner, devoid of pathogens.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cold Storage Order (1980)\n</b><br>The Cold Storage Order, 1980, promulgated under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, has the objective of ensuring hygienic and proper refrigeration conditions in a cold store, regulating the growth of the cold storage industry and rendering technical guidance for the scientific preservation of foodstuffs in a cold store and prevent exploitation of farmers by cold store owners. Agricultural Marketing Adviser to the Government of India is the licensing officer under this order.\n<br>In addition to the mandatory acts and orders cited above, agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Standards, the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection have also laid down quality standards for foods. These are, however voluntary.\n<br>\n<br><b>BUREAU OF INDIAN STANDARDS</b>\n<br>The Bureau of Indian Standards operates a Certification Mark Scheme under the BIS Act, 1986. Standards covering more than 450 different food products have been published.\n<br>Standards are laid for vegetable and fruit products, spices and condiments, animal products and processed foods. Once these standards are accepted, manufacturers whose products conform to these standards are allowed to use the BIS labels on each unit of their product. The product are checked for quality by the BIS in their own network of testing laboratories at Delhi, Bombay,  Calcutta, Madras, Chandigarh and Patna or in a number of public and private laboratories recognized by them.\n<br>\n<br>The certification scheme is basically voluntary in character but for a number of items affecting, it has been made compulsory by the Government of India through various statutory measures such as E.C. Act or PFA rules.\n<br>Some of the items which require compulsory BIS certification under PFA are :\n<br>\n<br>● Food colors and food color preparation\n<br>● Natural food additives\n<br>● Infant milk food\n<br>● Infant formula\n<br>● Milk cereal-based weaning food\n<br>● Milk powder\n<br>● Condensed milk\n<br>\n<br><b>THE AGMARK STANDARD</b>\n<br>The word ‘AGMARK’ is derived from Agricultural Marketing. The AGMARK standard was set up by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection of the Government of India by introducing an Agricultural produce Act in 1937. The word ‘AGMARK’ seal ensures quality and purity. A sample AGMARK seal is given below :\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

The quality of a product is determined with reference to the size, variety, weight, color, moisture, fat content and other factors are taken into account. The act defines the quality of cereals, spices, oilseeds, oil, butter, ghee, legumes and eggs and provides for the categorization of commodities into grades depending on the degree of purity in each case. The grades incorporated are grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 or special, good, fair and ordinary. The standards also specify the types of packaging to be used for different products. The physical and chemical characteristics of products are kept in mind while formulating the AGMARK specifications\n<br>The Directorate of Marketing and Inspection of Central Government has 21 laboratories and 50 sub-offices spread all over the country. The central AGMARK Laboratory at Nagpur continuously carries out research and development work in this field.\n<br>Grading of commodities like ghee, butter, vegetable oils, atta, spices and honey is voluntary. On the other hand, grading of commodities like tobacco, walnuts, spices, basmati rice, essential oils, onions, potatoes are meant for export is compulsory under AGMARK ensures the quality of products to the importers.\n<br>\n<br><b>EXPORT INSPECTION COUNCIL</b>\n<br>The council has been constituted to check the quality of a number of food materials meant for export. The council has powers to reject any food which does not measure up to standards prescribed for the food. Canned food such as mango juice, frozen food such as shrimp, pomfrets is subjected to scrutiny by this body before export.\n<br>\n<br><b>CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1986\n</b><br>The main objective of the Act is to promote and protect the rights of the consumers, with regard to defective goods, deficiency of services, overcharging or any unfair trade practices.\n<br>Complaints can be referred to the District consumer redressal forum. The forum can order the opposite party for removal of the defect, replacement of the goods, return of the prices or charges or order payment of the compensation for the loss or damage suffered due to deficiency of service. Appeals can be made to the state commission and then to the National Commission.\n<br>In India, consumer awareness about the various aspects of the prevention of the Food Adulteration Act is lacking. If consumer cooperation is not forthcoming, controlling adulteration would prove to be an uphill task.\n<br>\n<br><b>CODEX ALIMENTARIUS\n</b><br>FAO/WHO Food standards program is called CODEX ALIMENTARIUS. The Codex Alimentarius which means “Food Law” or “Food code” in Latin is a combined set of standards, codes or practices and other model regulations available for countries to use and apply to food the international trade.\n<br>The dual objectives of the Codex Alimentarius Commission are to protect the health of consumers and facilitate and international trade.\n<br>Codex commodity standards cover such foods as fruit juices, cereals, meat products, etc. General standards cover areas applicable to most foods such as labeling, additives, contaminants, methods of analysis. It covers aspects such as food hygiene and technological practices. They are used by processors to ensure that are foods are microbiologically safe and are fit for human consumption e.g., codex code of hygienic practice of low-acid canned foods. Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) have been set for pesticides. Specifications for “food grade quality” of additives form an important part of codex work.\n<br>\n<br><b>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO)\n</b><br>\n<br>The World Trade Organization came into being in 1995. One of the youngest international organizations, the WTO is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established in the wake of the Second World War. While the WTO is still young, the multilateral trading system that was originally set up under GATT is well over 50 years old.\n<br>\n<br>The past 50 years have seen exceptional growth in world trade. Merchandise exports grew on average by 6% annually. Total trade in 2000 was 22-times the level of 1950. GATT and the WTO have helped to create a strong and prosperous trading system contributing to unprecedented growth.\n<br>\n<br>The system was developed through a series of trade negotiations, or rounds, held under GATT. The first rounds dealt mainly with tariff reductions but later negotiations included other areas such as anti-dumping and non-tariff measures. The last round — the 1986-94 Uruguay Round — led to the WTO’s creation.\n<br>\n<br>The WTO’s overriding objective is to help trade flow smoothly, freely, fairly and predictably. It does this by:\n<br>\n<br>● Administering trade agreements\n<br>● Acting as a forum for trade negotiations\n<br>● Settling trade disputes\n<br>● Reviewing national trade policies\n<br>● Assisting developing countries in trade policy issues, through technical assistance and training programmes\n<br>● Cooperating with other international organizations\n<br>\n<br><b>10 benefits of the WTO trading system</b>\n<br>1.\tThe system helps promote peace\n<br>2.\tDisputes are handled constructively\n<br>3.\tRules make life easier  for all\n<br>4.\tFreer trade cuts the costs of living\n<br>5.\tIt provides more choice of products and qualities\n<br>6.\tTrade raises incomes\n<br>7.\tTrade stimulates economic growth\n<br>8.\tThe basic principles make life more efficient\n<br>9.\tGovernments are shielded from lobbying\n<br>10.\tThe system encourages good government\n<br>\n<br>The WTO agreements cover goods, services and intellectual property. They spell out the principles of liberalization, and the permitted exceptions. They include individual countries’ commitments to lower customs tariffs and other trade barriers and to open and keep open services markets. They set procedures for settling disputes. They prescribe special treatment for developing countries. They require governments to make their trade policies transparent. And they share a common three-part structure.\n<br>\n<br><b>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION (ISO)\n</b><br>\n<br>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies from more than 140 countries, one from each country.\n<br>ISO is a non-governmental organization established in 1947. The mission of ISO is to promote the development of standardization and related activities in the world with a view to facilitating the international exchange of goods and services, and to developing cooperation in the spheres of intellectual, scientific, technological and economic activity. ISO's work results in international agreements which are published as International Standards.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

In this manner, HACCP attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products for the effects of those hazards. The HACCP system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from food production and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>Importance of HACCP\n</b><br>● Prioritizes and controls potential hazards in food production.\n<br>● Controlling major food risks, such as microbiological, chemical and physical contaminants\n<br>● Provides the framework to produce foods safely and to prove they were produced safely.\n<br>● Focuses on prevention and control of potential food safety hazards rather than inspection.\n<br>● Covers all types of potential food safety hazards whether they are naturally occurring in the food, contributed by the environment, or generated by a mistake in the manufacturing process. Hazards such as Biological hazards (e.g. bacteria, viruses), Chemical hazards (e.g. pesticide residues, and mycotoxins) and Physical hazards (e.g. metal, glass).\n<br>● Various customers in the food chain required their suppliers to have certified HACCP systems.\n<br>● Provide businesses with a cost effective system for control of food safety, from ingredients right through to production, storage and distribution to sale and service of the final consumer.\n<br>● Put in place a way of keeping records to document the HACCP system, including verification and deviation records.\n<br><br><b>7 PRINCIPLES THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A HACCP SYSTEM\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Principle 1 - Conduct a Hazard Analysis\n</b><br>The application of this principle involves listing the steps in the process and identifying where significant hazards are likely to Occur. The HACCP team will focus on hazards that can be prevented, eliminated or controlled by the HACCP plan. A justification for including or excluding the hazard is reported and possible control measures are identified.\n<br>\n<b><br>Principle 2 - Identify the Critical Control Points\n</b><br>A critical control point (CCP) is a point, step or procedure at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. The HACCP team will use a CCP decision tree to help identify the critical control points in the process. A critical control point may control more than one food safety hazard or in some cases more than one CCP is needed to control a single hazard. The number of CCP's needed depends on the processing steps and the control needed to assure food safety.\n<br>\n<br><b>Principle 3 - Establish Critical Limits\n</b><br>A critical limit (CL) is the maximum and/or minimum value to which a biological, chemical, or physical parameter must be controlled at a CCP to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of a food safety hazard. The critical limit is usually a measure such as time, temperature, water activity (Aw), pH, weight, or some other measure that is based on scientific literature and/or regulatory standards.\n<br>\n<br><b>Principle 4- Monitor CCP\n</b><br>The HACCP team will describe monitoring procedures for the measurement of the critical limit at each critical control point. Monitoring procedures should describe how the measurement will be taken, when the measurement is taken, who is responsible for the measurement and how frequently the measurement is taken during production.\n<br>\n<br><b>Principle 5 - Establish Corrective Action\n</b><br>Corrective actions are the procedures that are followed when a deviation in a critical limit occurs. The HACCP team will identify the steps that will be taken to prevent potentially hazardous food from entering the food chain and the steps that are needed to correct the process. This usually includes identification of the problems and the steps taken to assure that the problem will not occur again.\n<br>\n<br><b>Principle 6 - Verification\n</b><br>Those activities, other than monitoring, determine the validity of the HACCP plan and that the system is operating according to the plan. The HACCP team may identify activities such as auditing of CCP's, record review, prior shipment review, instrument calibration and product testing as part of the verification activities.\n<br>\n<br><b>Principle 7 - Record keeping\n</b><br>A key component of the HACCP plan is recording information that can be used to prove that a food was produced safely. The records also need to include information about the HACCP plan. Records should include information on the HACCP Team, product description, flow diagrams, the hazard analysis, the CCP's identified, Critical Limits, Monitoring System, Corrective Actions, Recordkeeping Procedures, and Verification Procedures.\n<br>\n<br><b>HACCP Does not Stand Alone\n</b><br>The application of HACCP does not stand alone in a food processing facility. The plan must be built on other food safety programs. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) that are practiced by the processing facility will support the HACCP plan and will address food safety and food quality issues that are not critical for the reduction of food safety hazards. Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOP's) are required in federally inspected meat and poultry operations and address procedures for clean facilities, equipment and personnel that are necessary for all products produced in a facility.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Successful implementation of HACCP</b>\n<br>Even the best prepared HACCP plan will not work if the workforce have not bought into the system, or have not been suitably trained in it. Key points for successful implementation of HACCP are:\n<br>• Full management commitment.\n<br>• Suitable training for all staff – this doesn’t necessarily mean a formal course for everyone. Verbal on the job instructions with visual reminders at CCP points may be all that is required.\n<br>• Quick handover from HACCP team to all staff once system is established.\n<br>• Regular reviews of the system.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It is the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards and it facilitates world trade by providing common standards among nations. More than twenty thousand standards have been set, covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture, and healthcare.\n<br>\n<br>Use of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable, and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.\n<br>\n<br><b>Why ISO important\n</b><br>Its aim is to help organisations meet the needs of their customers and other stakeholders more effectively. This is achieved by building a framework to ensure consistent quality in the provision of goods and/or services.\nThe standard is based on 7 quality management principles, which include having a strong customer focus, the involvement of top management, and a drive for continual improvement.\n<br>\n<br>The seven quality management principles are:\n<br>\n<br>1 – Customer focus\n<br>2 – Leadership\n<br>3 – Engagement of people\n<br>4 – Process approach\n<br>5 – Improvement\n<br>6 – Evidence-based decision making\n<br>7 – Relationship management\n<br>\n<br><b>Key benefits of ISO</b>\n<br>ISO is an internationally recognized certification which ensures quality of products and services of a company. Being ISO certified has lots of benefits to corporations. Some of these benefits include but not limited to;\n<br>\n<br><b>Increased Credibility and Recognition: </b>ISO certification is issued by International Organization for Standard and is accepted worldwide. Therefore, having ISO certification increases the value of your company against your competitors as well as increases your status among your clients.\n<br>\n<br><b>Increased Revenues:</b> Since your company is ISO certified, it means your quality has been testified. Therefore, you can use this as an advertising point and price your products accordingly. Having more quality products will also help you gain more customers.\n<br>\n<br><b>Improved Consistency:</b> ISO helps you increase the control of your business processes and the more you control your business, the more your consistency increases. Increased consistency means your customers are getting the same service or same products every time they are making business with you.\n<br>\n<br><b>Improved decision-making:</b> You can detect and identify problems in good time, which means that you can quickly take steps to avoid the same mistakes in the future\n<br>\n<br><b>Increased Customer Satisfaction:</b> Customers will know that your products and services will always have quality and that they will work. They will know what to expect from you. Therefore, you will get less complaints and more satisfied customers.\n<br>\n<br><b>Empowered Employees:</b> ISO certification requires the training and development of your staff being maintained. Also, it provides the necessary tools for them to do their jobs such as procedures, instructions and metrics. As a result, your employees will be more knowledgeable of what they are doing and since they will keep getting trained, their careers will improve.\n<br>\n<br><b>Few Important ISO Standards\n</b><br>\n<br><b>ISO-9000 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n</b><br>\n<br>The present ISO 9001:2008 (QMS) has undergone a number of revisions from 1987 when it was first\npublished. The first revision was done in 1994 based on actual experiences of several thousand companies. The next revision came in 2000. This third revision of the standard was necessitated because of the publication of the revised version of ISO 9001:2008 in the year 2008. This quality\nstandard is easy to apply and understand. It can be adopted by any organisation who is into\nmanufacturing or in services. Without making any major changes within the organisation, one\ncan reap the benefit to improve its actual system and also the quality of the product/services with\n100% guarantee for the deliverance of defect free product/services.\n<br><br><i>The benefits an organisation gets by adopting ISO certification are as follows.\n</i><br>1. Increased business.\n<br>2. 100% utilization of time and materials.\n<br>3. Improved efficiency.\n<br>4. Consistent quality and timely delivery.\n<br>5. 100% customer satisfaction.\n<br>o. Improved control of quality, processes.\n<br>7. Motivated staff with consistency output. \n<br>3. The documented system helps in Backtracking.\n<br>9. Less percentage of rejection.\n<br>10. Total control on quality and output.\n<br>11. Validated test records of equipment.\n<br>12. Valid records readily identifiable.\n<br>\n<br><b>ISO 9000 and TQM\n</b><br>ISO 9000 is not TQM, but is a subcomponent of TQM and a good start on the TQM path. ISO 9000\nis only the minimum required quality standard that a supplier must demonstrate to receive the ISO\n9000) accreditation. TQM by contrast is much more comprehensive. TQM links quality to customer\nsatisfaction by requiring action on four essentials:\n<br><br>(i) a strong customer orientation (internal and external in all activities in the organisation);\n<br>(ii) top management's direct involvement in the delivery of quality;\n<br>(iii) total company-wide participation in the delivery of quality; and\n<br>(iv) the systematic analysis of quality problems focused on continuous improvement of quality performance and the prevention of quality problems.\n<br>\n<br><b>ISO 14000 - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n</b><br>ISO 14000 is a series of international standards on environmental management. It provides a framework for the development of an environmental management system and the supporting audit programme.\n<br>The main thrust for its development came as a result of the Rio summit on the Environment\nheld in 1992.\n<br>As a number of national standards emerged (BS 7750 being the first ), the International\nOrganisation for Standardisation (ISO) created a group to investigate how such standards might\n<br>benefit business and industry. As a result this group recommended that an ISO committee be\ncreated to create an International standard.\n<br>\n<br>ISO 14001 is the cornerstone standard of the ISO 14000 series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organisation can be certified by a third party.\nOther ISO 14000 standards in the series are actually guidelines, many to help one achieve registration to ISO 14001.\n<br>\n<br>● ISO 14004 provides guidance on the development and implementation of environmental management systems.\n<br>●ISO 14010 provides general principles of environmental auditing (now superseded by ISO 19011).\n<br>●ISO 14011 provides specific guidance on audit and environmental management system\n(now superseded by ISO 19011).\n<br>●ISO 14012 provides guidance on qualification criteria for environmental auditors and lead auditors (now superseded by ISO 19011).\n<br>●ISO 14013/5 provides audit program review and assessment material.\n<br>●ISO 14020 + labelling issues.\n<br>●ISO 14030 + provides guidance on performance targets and monitoring within an Environmental Management System.\n<br>●ISO 14040 + covers life cycle issues.\n<br>\n<br>Of all these, ISO 14001 is not only the most well known, but is the only ISO 14000 standard against\nwhich it is currently possible to be certified by an external certification authority.\n<br>\n<br><b>ISO 22000 FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n</b><br>ISO 22000 is an international standard that defines the requirements of a food safety management\nsystem covering all organisations in the food chain from farm to fork.\n<br>It is suitable for any business in the entire food chain, including inter-related organisations such as producers of equipment, packaging material, cleaning agents, additives and ingredients. ISO 22000:2005 is also for companies seeking to integrate their quality management system, e.g. ISO 9001:2000 and their food safety management system.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>ISO 22000:2005 Provides\n</i></b><br>1. Interactive communication, internationally and across the supply chain.\n<br>2. Compliance with HACCP principles such as hazard analysis, identify critical control points (CCPs) , establish critical links, monitor CCPs, establish corrective action, record keeping and verification.\n<br>3. Harmony with voluntary and pre-requisite standards.\n<br>4. A Structure that is aligned with ISO 9001:2000.\n<br>5. Process control.\n<br>\n<br><b>ISO 22000:2005 Certification Has the Following Advantages\n</b><br>●Improves the organisations profile and credibility.\n<br>●Provides a harmonised standard accepted all over the world.\n<br>●Simple to understand, apply and recognise because management system principles have been integrated with HACCP.\n<br>●Helps in ensuring compliance with all food safety legislations.\n<br>●Reduces possible risks of penalties and litigation.\n<br>●Transforms the organisations corporate image.\n<br>●Enhances the products quality and safety.\n<br>●Allows Continuous improvement of the food system.\n<br>●Enhances overall performance of organisation.\n<br>●Ensures to compete effectively in national and international markets.\n<br>\n<br>ISO 22000:2005 specifies requirements for a food safety management system where an organisation\nin the food chain needs to demonstrate its ability to control food safety hazards in order to ensure\nthat food is safe at the time of human consumption.\n<br>It is applicable to all organisations, regardless of size, which are involved in any aspect of food\nchain and want to implement systems that consistently provide safe products. The means of\nmeeting any requirements of ISO 22000:2005 can be accomplished through the use of internal and/\nor external resources.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>ISO 22000:2005 specifies requirements to enable an organisation.\n</i></b><br>\n<br>●to plan, implement, operate, maintain and update a food safety management system aimed at providing products that, according to their intended use, are safe for the consumer,\n<br>●to demonstrate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory food safety\nrequirements,\n<br>●to evaluate and assess customer requirements and demonstrate conformity with those mutually agreed customer requirements that relate to food safety, in order to enhance customer\n<br>satisfaction,\n<br>●to effectively communicate food safety issues to their suppliers, customers and relevant interested parties in the food chain,\n<br>●to ensure that the organisation conforms to its stated food safety policy,\n<br>●to demonstrate such conformity to relevant interested parties, and\n<br>●to seek certification or registration of its food safety management system by an external organisation, or make a self-assessment or self-declaration of conformity to ISO 22000:2005.\n<br>\n<br>The ISO 22000, is the one universal food safety management standard that works across all other\nstandards. This standard uses a common vocabulary and improves communications between\neveryone involved in the food industry.\n<br>\n<br><b>Few other Standards\n</b><br>\n<br><b>ISO 50001: 2018 - Energy Management\n</b><br>ISO 50001: 2018 provides guidance for companies in implementing an Energy Management System (EnMS) that aims at improving efficiency in the use of energy.&nbsp;This aims to reduce an organisation’s energy footprint by minimising greenhouse gas emissions. ISO 50001 is not obligatory, and many organisations implement it solely to comply with stakeholder expectations. Over 20,000 certifications have been issued for this standard with a 69% increase from 2015.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>OBJECTIVE OF ISO 50001:2018\n</i></b><br>It’s designed to be S.M.A.R.T (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-based): \n<br>• Identify and monitor the costs of energy consumption. \n<br>• Involve collating and analysing the utility bills (electricity, gas, water) and any other bills relating to energy consumption. \n<br>• The charging system and tariffs should be checked to determine if an improved rate \n<br>• Reduction of wastes and improvement of recycling rate \n<br>• Promotion of energy and resource conservation \n<br>• Proper control of chemical substances \n<br>• Development of environmentally benign products \n<br>\n<br><br><b>ISO 31000: 2018 - Risk Management\n</b><br>Today’s business world is riddled with uncertainty. Risks facing companies have a direct impact on the economic performance, reputation, as well as safety and environmental outcomes.\n<br>\n<br>ISO 31000 cannot be used for certification purposes, but it provides a framework for managing risks. It offers guidance to organisations for internal and external audit programs, and enables organisations to achieve objectives in an uncertain environment by facilitating the identification of opportunities and threats.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>Principles of ISO 31000\n</i></b><br>● Risk management must be integrated into all business operations and activities\n<br>● The approach must be structured and comprehensive.\n<br>● Processes and the risk management framework should be customized to suit the organization’s goals and context.\n<br>● Stakeholders must be involved with the management framework; it must be inclusive.\n<br>● Risk management must be dynamic and robust; preemptive thinking, anticipating, detecting, acknowledging and responding to changes.\n<br>● Risk management takes into account any limitations of available information.\n<br>● Human and cultural factors are paramount, and should be considered at all stages and aspects of risk management.\n<br>● The risk management framework is continuously improved through learning and experience.\n<br>\n<br><b>Benefits of ISO 31000\n</b><br>\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Giving you a competitive advantage</i></b> because ISO is an internationally recognized symbol for quality standards\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Increasing employee awareness of organizational risks</i></b> by including them in the management framework and giving them responsibility for the processes they commonly use\n<br>● <b><i>Reduce the frequency of, and ultimately eliminate risks</i></b> by educating employees and stakeholders on identified risks\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Improve trust of stakeholders</i></b> by maintaining transparency and communicating risks (and demonstrating risk responsibility and mitigation)\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Foster forward-thinking mentalities </i></b>by encouraging employees to envision all potential outcomes of a given situation\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Improve company culture </i></b>by bringing disparate departments together to exchange fresh perspectives, and consider how they might work together more effectively\n<br>●<b><i> Improve success rate</i></b> in all business operations by focusing on the process, thinking preemptively instead of reactively, and giving employees ownership of their work responsibilities\n<br><br>ISO 31000 can be invaluable for preparing a business for all eventualities; by understanding the worst-case scenario, a business is better equipped to make the most of the resources and opportunities currently available to them.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.\n<br>\n<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was\ncooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.\n<br>\n<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur\nin food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.\n<br>\n<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to\ncreate an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?\n</b><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.\n<br>\n<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARBOHYDRATES</b> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.\nHeat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and\ngelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the\nSugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a\ncaramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.\n<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,\nThe thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.\n<br>\n<br><b>VEGETABLE FIBRE</b> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.\n<br>\n<br><b>PROTEINS</b> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in\ndissolving few connective tissues.\n<br>\n<br><b>FATS</b> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.\n<br>\n<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond\na certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>CONCLUSION\n</b><br>\n<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.\n<br>\n<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:\n<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.\n<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.\n<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.\n<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.\n<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.\n<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.\n<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.\n<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.\n<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.\n<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS TEXTURES\n</b><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:\n<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel\n<br>\n<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.\n<br>\n<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.\n<br>\n<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.\nThis satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.\n<br>\n<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.\n<br><br>● Airy\n<br>● Spongy\n<br>● Jelly\n<br>● Soft\n<br>● Hard / Firm\n<br>● Short\n<br>● Flaky\n<br>● Coarse\n<br>● Heavy\n<br>● Light\n<br>● Grainy\n<br>● Smooth\n<br>● Crispy\n<br>● Crunchy\n<br>● Creamy\n<br>● Chewy\n<br>● Crusty\n<br>● Chunky\n<br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:\n<br><br><b>1) Thick consistency:</b> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.\n<br><b>2) Pouring consistency:</b> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.\n<br><b>3) Thin consistency:</b> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.\n<br><b>4) Frozen consistency:</b> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Fibre</b> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.\n<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components. The amount of fiber varies in different vegetables, for example, tomatoes and spinach have fewer fibers than turnips or carrots. Even the age of vegetables would determine the amount of fiber in it, for example, young baby carrots would have less fiber as compared to older tougher carrots. In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.\n<br>\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the\ncooking time.\n<br>\n<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.\n<br><br><b>Sugars</b> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Starch</b> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.\n<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doneness</b> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.\n<br>\n<br><i>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Do not overcook.\n<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.\n<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.\n<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.\n<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Cooking for a short time.\n<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.\n<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.\n<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.\n<br>\n<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● High heat or temperature\n<br>● Long cooking\n<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching\n<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)\n<br>\n<br><i>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:\n</i><br>\n<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.\n<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.\n<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br><b>1) Washing:</b> to remove dirt.\n<br><b>2) Peeling:</b> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.\n<br><b>3) Pairing:</b> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.\n<br><b>4) Cutting:</b> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)\n<br><b>5) Mincing:</b> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.\n<br><b>6) Shredding:</b> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.\n<br><b>7) Slicing:</b> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.\n<br><b>8) Slitting:</b> example green chilies.\n<br><b>9) Grating:</b> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.\n<br><b>10) Grinding:</b> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.\n<br><b>11) Mashing:</b> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.\n<br><b>12) Pressing:</b> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.\n<br><b>13) Sieving:</b> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.\n<br><b>14) Refining:</b> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.\n<br><b>15) Skimming:</b> removing a floating layer.\n<br><b>16) Rendering:</b> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.\n<br><b>17) Filtration:</b> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.\n<br><b>18) Evaporation and reduction:</b> removal of water without the lid.\n<br><b>19) Homogenization:</b> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).\n<br><b>20) Emulsification:</b> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:\n</b><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.\n<br>\n<br><b>1) Beating:</b> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.\n<br><b>2) Blending:</b> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.\n<br><b>3) Cutting:</b> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.\n<br><b>4) Creaming:</b> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual\nincorporation of sugar as in cake making.\n<br><b>5) Folding:</b> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.\n<br><b>6) Kneading</b>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.\n<br><b>7) Marinating:</b> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.\n<br><b>8) Stirring:</b> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.\n<br><b>9) Whipping:</b> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Owners see the hotel as a real estate and investment opportunity; managers expect the project to meet certain strategic goals and provide revenue; future guests need accommodations for business or personal travel, and others have myriad reasons for involvement in the development and design process.\n<br>\n<br><b>The Feasibility Study\n</b><br>Among the first steps that the developer takes is to study the feasibility of the proposed hotel. The feasibility study is usually prepared by a consulting firm and reviewed by the hotel management company. Its purpose is twofold: first, it Assesses present and future demand for lodging and such hotel services like meeting rooms, restaurants and lounges, and recreational facilities. Secondly, it estimates the proposed hotel’s operating income and expenses for five to ten years after the\n<br>hotel opens.\n<br>A hotel’s owner has many reasons for undertaking a feasibility study. Most will use the study to help obtain permanent financing; others may use it to gain a franchise or management agreement, attract equity partners, or support a request for a zoning change. Interestingly, only infrequently do these studies actually assess a project’s feasibility, which may largely depend on the owner’s investment\n<br>strategies and tax status. Instead, a feasibility study provides a description of the local area and potential markets, recommends proposed facilities, and projects cash flow. The typical report usually covers the following components:\n<br>\n<br><b>● Local area evaluation:</b> Analyzes the economic vitality of the city or region and describes the suitability of the project site for a hotel.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Lodging market analysis:</b> Assesses the present demand for lodging and other revenue generators and future growth rates for each of several market segments, and identifies the existing supply of competitive properties and their probable growth.\n<br>● Proposed facilities: Proposes a balance of guestroom and revenue-generating public facilities (restaurants and lounges, function rooms, retail stores, recreational facilities) and assesses the competitive position of the property.\n<br>● Financial analysis: Estimates income and expenses for the hotel over a five- or ten-year period to show its potential cash flow after fixed charges (before debt service and income tax).\n<br>\n<br><b>HOTEL PLANNING</b>\n<br>The architectural team needs to investigate the site before it can begin to develop the building’s form and organization. The following list identifies some of the things the architect must do:\n<br>\n<br>● Visibility and accessibility: Consider surrounding street patterns, road access.\n<br>● Surface conditions: Analyze terrain, vegetation, utilities, existing buildings and roads, environmental constraints.\n<br>● Subsurface conditions: Investigate water table, bearing capacity of the soil, underground utilities, environmental hazards.\n<br>● Regulatory restrictions: Research applicable zoning, parking, building, and other codes.\n<br>● Site character: Study surface conditions (above), adjoining uses, views.\n<br>● Orientation and climate: Position building and recreational facilities for sun; analyze micro climate (for resorts).\n<br>● Adaptability: Determine the site’s potential for expansion or development for other uses.<br><br><b>What is BluePrint in Constructions</b>\n<br>Construction blueprints (also known as construction plans or construction drawings) are two-dimensional drawings that contain all the details that are needed for a project. Blueprints are far more detailed and technical plans for your remodel or other construction project. These details are needed to request permits, determine the construction schedule, and eventually do the construction itself. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction and industry.\n<br>\n<br><b>Why are blueprints important?\n</b><br>● Drawings thereby allow you to measure your compliance against the specifications.\n<br>● They allow you to guide needed installations by referencing as-built drawing sets and enable you to track any kind of modification or addition with what you are installing.\n<br>● Blueprints and drawings are also great resources for maintenance and troubleshooting.<br>\n<br><b>Following points to be considered while plan &amp; design the hotels\n</b><br>Hotel interior designers need to consider which areas should be separated and which can effectively be combined.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. GUEST ROOMS:\n</b><br>Guestroom into separate areas, accommodating such overlapping functions as sleeping, working, lounging, dressing, and hygiene. In addition, the interior designer must select individual furnishings that meet a number of basic design criteria:\n<br>\n<br>● Beds: Determine the exact room mix for the hotel; provide adequate spacing; include bedside tables and adequate lighting; consider TV viewing angle.\n<br>● Work area: Provide a desk or worktable, consider chair height and comfort, and provide a phone and adequate lighting.\n<br>● Lounge area: Provide a soft seating group; consider comfort, lighting, table(s), TV viewing angle, and adequate space for foldout sofa; assess need for mini-bar.\n<br>● Clothes storage/dressing area: Determine requirements for drawer space, the size of the closet, and luggage storage needs; provide full-length mirrors.\n<br>● Bathroom: Select bathroom fixtures and accessories; consider lighting, counter space, ventilation, and finishes.\n<br>● Decor: Evaluate furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&amp;E)—carpet, wall covering, sheer and blackout drapes, bedspreads, and so forth.\n<br>● Other: Screen view into guest room from the corridor; provide a separate dressing area; assess the need for balcony, adjoining rooms, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. LOBBY\n</b><br>The development team must establish criteria for the planning and design of the lobby, based on the hotel’s concept and the guest markets it will attract. These criteria might include the following:\n<br>\n<br>● Circulation: Provide clear paths to front desk, elevators, food and beverage (F&amp;B) outlets, function space, etc.\n<br>● Front desk: Make the front desk visible to entering guests. It should overlook the elevators, have sufficient space for check-in‘ check-out lines, and have direct access to the front office.\n<br>● Luggage: Provide areas for bell persons, luggage storage, and other locked storage.\n<br>● Seating: Provide seating near the front desk and entrance, with more private seating nearby, and determine the need for a lobby lounge.\n<br>● Support functions: Conveniently locate retail outlets, the concierge desk, public restrooms, house and pay phones, coatrooms, the hotel directory, etc.\n<br>● Décor: Establish the hotel’s image with millwork, furnishings, artwork, lighting, signage, and so forth that are appropriate to the locale.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. FOOD AND BEVERAGE OUTLETS\n</b><br><b><i>A) Restaurants\n</i></b><br>Restaurants and lounges, because they face such severe outside competition, create the greatest operational and design challenges, Whatever the concept, the food and beverage designer must attempt to meet many generally accepted design criteria:\n<br>\n<br>● Location: Position the main three-meal restaurant convenient to the lobby. Consider locating the specialty restaurant with direct exterior access.\n<br>● Service: Group all food outlets close to the kitchen or a satellite pantry, and provide bars with nearby storage and support areas.\n<br>● Flexibility: Design large restaurants and bars so that sections can be closed during slow periods.\n<br>● Support areas: Place public restrooms, coatrooms, and telephones nearby.\n<br>● Layout: Provide a desk for the host, service stations, and a flexible mix of table sizes. Minimize or eliminate floor-level changes to better accommodate disabled guests.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>B) Function Space\n</i></b><br>● Location: Group all function areas in a location easily accessible from the lobby; in major convention hotels consider creating two or more separate function zones.\n<br>● Flexibility: Include moveable partitions in larger rooms, determine the need for multi-purpose versus dedicated rooms, and create multiple pre-function areas.\n<br>● Access: Provide a separate entrance to the function area from the street or parking lot, provide public and service access to each function room, and consider the access needs for moving display materials into the ballroom and exhibit areas.\n<br>● Support areas: Include sufficient restrooms, coatrooms, and telephones for the public and provide banquet pantry, furniture, and audiovisual storage in the back-of-the-house.\n<br>● Structure: Provide column-free function spaces and locate the ballroom and larger meeting rooms independent of the guest room tower to simplify the hotel's structure.\n<br>● Ceiling height: Determine the need for projection booths in the larger function rooms and consider how the high ceilings in these rooms will affect the floor above.\n<br>● Windows: Determine the need for natural light in function and assembly areas.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>C) Recreational Facilities:\n</i></b><br>● Floors: Select a carpet pattern to aid in room setup; use a portable dance floor.\n<br>● Walls: Apply a chair rail to walls to protect their finish; add fabric panels to improve acoustics and upgrade room appearance.\n<br>● Ceiling: Organize HVAC, lighting, sound system, fire protection, and other systems into a unified design.\n<br>● Windows: Add full blackout capability.\n<br>● Furniture: Select risers, lecterns, stacking chairs, and a balance of rectangular classroom tables and round or oval banquet tables; select high-quality chairs for upgraded conference rooms.\n<br>● Lighting: Provide a fully dimmable system including, as appropriate, chandeliers, down lights, track lights, fluorescent lighting, and decorative wall fixtures.\n<br>● HVAC/systems: Provide separate mechanical, electrical, and sound systems for each room division.\n<br>● Communications: Include TV, telephone, recording, and data lines in each function and control room.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A renovation is a conversion of an old structure into a new one within the framework. It typically matches the modern needs and requirements. Complete evacuation of the renovation area is necessary, although floor-by-floor or room-by room renovation is sometimes possible in case of minor renovation. Additionally, renovation brings something back to life and gives a new look.Under hotel renovation, the tangible products are changed, modified, updated or improved.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reason to Renovate\n</b><br>● <b>To fix a safety issue -&nbsp;</b>In hotel renovation some safety issues like electric problems, leakages, cracks in walls are handled that must be taken care of for safety and to prevent any catastrophic event.\n<br>● <b>To upgrade the functionality of the property -</b> Renovation enhances the functioning of the hotel operations. Moreover, it should not decrease the usable space or lower the value of the establishment.\n<br>● <b>To increase the comfort or and leisure of the hotel -</b> Renovation increases the comfort and leisure of the establishment. Although, the renovation should not be done solely for enhancing the aesthetic appeal or else it will end up being just a showplace, lacking the feeling of peace and relaxation.\n<br>● <b>To improve the value of the establishment - </b>Renovation improves the value of the establishment. It is often carried out to have the best returns of the value at the time of sale.\n<br>● <b>To increase the efficiency of the establishment - </b>Improvements in the structure such as new appliances and added insulation decrease the energy usage, thereby reducing the costs. It is observed that such energy efficient structures are an attraction to buyers due to their cost saving ability.\n<br>● <b>To update the style of the establishment - </b>Older structures look out dated and often less attractive. Although, renovation may take place as per the new trends of the market but the timeless styles add to the sophistication of the establishment and can command a premium price from the clientele.\n<br>● <b>To prepare the building for sale -</b> Renovation may even take place before the sale of the establishment. Generally, neutral colours, upgrades that add value and fixing any cosmetic or functional problems help the structure to get in better shape for sale.\n<br>\n<br><b>Identifying The Need For Renovation\n</b><br>Hotels comprises a large number of depreciable elements that wear out or fade with regular use and become outdated and old fashioned which require maintenance or updation to match current market trends and to maintain brands reputation. The following points help in identifying the need for renovation.\n<br>\n<br>1. Cracks, holes or chips in tiles, walls, or floors which will become more severe if not\n<br>attended in time.\n<br>2. Dirty, faded, stained or worn out carpet looks shabby.\n<br>3. The creakiness and showing rust on doors and windows. The sound while operating doors and windows also give an idea, if they require maintenance or not.\n<br>4. Lighting system is not working properly and it feels dark in the room.\n<br>5. Scratched, broken or damaged furniture and fixtures.\n<br>6. Water is not running constantly through taps or there are other plumbing problems.\n<br>7.Creaky, rusty and loose flooring.\n<br>8. Mould signs in the washrooms, toilets or in other such areas.\n<br>9. Worn out, dirty or stained furnishing.\n<br>10. High level of humidity and moisture in the rooms\n<br><br>\n<br><b>Types of Renovation\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Special Projects –</b> The scope of a special project is to perform work related to a specific system upgrade that can be handled without changing the hotel’s interior design in any substantial way. As such, special projects have typically been related to technology or engineering systems. Examples include: installation of electronic locking systems, installation of equipment for high-speed Internet access, and fire sprinkler system retrofits.<br><br><b>Minor renovations(6-Year Cycle)</b> – The minor renovation deals with the renovation or replacement of less durable furnishing and finishes without changing the physical layout. In minor renovation, you’re repairing, repainting and replacement of carpet, furniture, wall covering, drapery and other minor fixing required attention. \n<br>\n<br><b>Major renovations (12 to 15 - Year Cycle)</b> – The major renovation deals with the renovation and replacement of all furnishing and finishes and it may include change in the physical layout. Major renovation is a big step in which a hotel may be going through floors, walls, ceilings or other places that a hotel wouldn’t usually get the chance to be in.A major renovation may include all minor renovations plus the replacement of lighting, fittings, bedding, furniture and other accessories. <br>Hotel will make some big changes which may be partitioning a room or removing walls for increasing the area. The major renovation is usually done to increase or decrease the area of the kitchen or bathroom. Floor or roof and exterior enclosure elements such as walls, windows and doors also are frequently part of a renovation. A hotel may add a new kitchen, guestroom, restaurant, banquet by moving some walls, but adding any extra rooms or space separately is not a part of major renovation. \n<br>\n<br><b>Restoration (25 to 45 - Year Cycle)</b> - In a restoration or total renovation, major elements such as entire corridors, lobby, elevators, stairs, lavatories, complete floor, electrical systems as well as emergency exits revamping, even locations or rooms are added, reconfigured, or relocated for efficient operations and other marketability reasons or to meet the new structural designs.\n<br>\n<br><b>\nThe Planning Phase\n</b><br>\n<br>The planning phase for property renovation consists of several steps:\n<br>\n<br>● Conduct strategic review\n<br>● Survey the property and create a preliminary project list\n<br>● Estimate project costs and benefits\n<br>\n<br><b>Conduct a Strategic Review:</b> The annual renovation process should begin with an understanding of the hotel’s long-term needs, ideally arrived at through a facility life-cycle cost study. However, this plan is normally based on the typical life of building components, without regard to current competitive pressures. Therefore, in addition to this long-term plan, management must have a strategy to contend with the property's immediate competitive environment.\n<br>\n<br>Owners and managers need to take a step-by-step approach to the assessment of the property's current and desired operational mission; there should be a rigorous periodic evaluation of the property, a strategic review. In most organizations, this step is usually handled as a joint effort between management and ownership, typically conducted by the property’s general manager and the owner’s representative or asset manager. In large hotel chains, regional or divisional managers are\n<br>also involved.\n<br>\n<br><b>Survey the Property and Create a Preliminary Project List:</b> The need to properly survey the property cannot be overemphasized. A thorough survey of the property helps management determine what areas and facilities need to be renovated. A proper survey includes input from all department heads. The survey is meant to identify needs and stimulate ideas. Another reason to survey is to force managers responsible for the renovation to inspect the spaces to be renovated. In many cases, two surveys are appropriate. The first survey is typically performed by the hotel's management to identify needs. Once renovation projects have been determined, a follow-up survey is done by the manager in charge of the renovation along with the designer(s) and/or engineer(s) to determine the exact scope of the renovation work. \n<br>\n<br><b>Estimating benefits:</b> There are two types of benefit analysis: one for projects directly affecting revenues, and the other for projects that support revenues. An example of a project directly affecting revenues is the renovation of a lounge; an example of a project that supports revenues would be replacing the roof. The key to analyzing projects directly affecting revenues is to compare the net benefits (i.e, increase in revenues due to renovation) with the renovation costs, using the appropriate present value techniques for revenues that are projected to occur in the future.<br><br><br><b>RENOVATION PROCESS\n</b><br>This process involves renovating a hotel property so as to give it a new and fresh look. This may include repairing and replacing furniture, finishes, soft furnishing and fittings that have become obsolete or need attention. This process is usually carried out every 4-6 years, depending on the wear and tear of building and budget of the hotel. The following steps are carried out in the refurbishing process.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Physical Evaluation:</b> Physical inspection of the hotel structure is necessary to determine whether refurbishing is required or not. Physical inspection is usually carried out by an executive housekeeper who checks every guestroom and areas in the building for refurbishing. After inspection, a detailed report is prepared which specifies the areas required renovation and estimated budget is prepared.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Time Allocation:</b> The expected time to complete the renovation process must be taken into account when preparing the reports and costs. The refurbishment process must be carried out in off season or during the period of low occupancy.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Budgeting:</b> Budgeting is to prepare the estimation cost required for the decided project. The detailed report for money expenditure is prepared for different areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Theme and Design feasibility:</b> In this stage a theme or design is decided for the specific area. Design may be same or different for different spaces.Once a theme or design is decided then a feasibility study is carried out to test the financial viability for the same.\n<br>\n<br><b>5. Décor Preliminaries:</b> Suitable decoration material such as fabrics, colours, finishes should be selected carefully. It should be durable, fire resistant, matching with theme and most importantly easy to clean and maintain.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Hiring Contractors:</b> The refurbishment is carried out either by the hotel staff or by the contractors. A cost comparison must be done before deciding whether a tender should be invited or not. Usually this kind of work is handled by the contractors as it is expensive to hire new staff, prepare new uniforms, arrange training programmes and so on.\n<br>\n<br>7. Equipment and Raw Material inventory and Ware-Housing: Equipment and raw material required for the process must be purchased after market research. Sufficient supplies should be available in the store all time.\n<br>\n<br><b>8. Pre Arrangements for guests, staff and suppliers:</b> Pre arrangement for guests should be made in prior for avoiding any inconvenience and discomfort to the guests. Guests should be informed about the renovation work carried out in the premises.\n<br>\n<br><b>9. Procedural Guidelines:</b> Guidelines are the parameters set aside to determine a course of action. It may include planning, regulations, evaluations, policies and laws related to the project.\n<br>\n<br><b>10. Control:</b> Success of any project largely depends upon controlling. Controlling checks the mistakes and errors and also helps in facing challenges. It helps in testing, regulating, adjusting or verifying. Controlling is necessary at each level and in each department. \n<br>\n<br><b>SUBSIDIARY PROCESS IN RENOVATION</b>\n<br>There are four major sub-processes in renovation.\n<br>\n<br><b>1. Refurbishing:</b> It involves repairing and fixing some areas or items, decorating a guest room,and restoring the hotels’ appearance and condition.The refurbishment includes changing the furniture, curtains, fittings etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Redecoration: </b>The process of applying paint, touching up of furniture and finishes, changing the wallpapers in rooms. It can also be used to change the style of rooms or other areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Restoration:</b> The term ‘restoration’ is the act of returning the building structure to its former condition. This is usually applied for heritage hotels and some old infrastructure. It also includes repairing walls, replacing old furniture and fixtures, removing old wood floors and refinishing hard floors.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Remodeling:</b> Remodeling is conversions of existing spaces and structure and the replacement of a defective area or item in the hotel and the addition of space and extensions.In this, a hotel focus on improving a structure that is defective, outdated, broken or damaged.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Post-Renovation Marketing Check-list:</b>\n<br>● Update the hotel’s website and third party booking sites with latest photos\n<br>● Send a press release to local media/newspapers\n<br>● Create videos and Google 360 video tour could be very effective\n<br>● Share renovation description, photos and videos over all social networking&nbsp;<br>● Update sales brochures\n<br>● Place digital frame with latest pictures at reception\n<br>● Email to past clients, notifying them about updating and up gradation&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A good design shows an orderly arrangement of the materials used and, in addition, creates beauty in the finished product.\n<br>Interior decoration can be a highly personal form of self-expression the sum of one’s interests as an individual or as a group as well as a practical statement created by combining various elements of art using certain design principles.\n<br>\n<br><b>PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN\n</b><br>The principles of design help one in determining the quality of a design to assess whether it is artistically good or poor in appearance. While using the basic elements of design or art, we should keep these principles in mind.\n<br>The principles of design are\n<br>● Proportion\n<br>● Balance\n<br>● Emphasis\n<br>● Rhythm\n<br>● Harmony\n<br>\n<br><b>Proportion\n</b><br>The principle of proportion is also called the ‘law of relationships’. The principle of proportion underlines all other principles of design. It states that the relations between parts of the same things or between different things of the same group should be aesthetically satisfying. It deals with relationships of size, shape, color, light, texture, and pattern. In order to achieve designs and arrangements that will hold interest, one must know how to create beautiful relationships within and around a space.\n<br>\n<br><b>Balance\n</b><br>Also known as equilibrium, balance is a condition of rest or repose. Through balance, we get a sense of equipoise. This restful effect is obtained by grouping shapes and colors around a center or pivotal point in such a way that there are equal attractions on each side of that center.\n<br>Balance can be understood well if one understands the principle of the see-saw, as both works on the same principle. Balance in design and art is not the same as balance in weight but is conceived in terms of the amount of attention each element attracts and can be treated in the same way.\n<br>\n<br><b>Emphasis\n</b><br>This is the design principle that directs us to create a point of interest such that the eye is carried first to the most important thing in any arrangement and from that point to every other detail in order of importance. Whenever any object is selected or arranged with reference to its appearance, the principle of emphasis is used, and the success of the result depends upon the knowledge of what to emphasize, how to emphasize; how much to emphasize; and where to place emphasis.\n<br>\n<br><b>Rhythm\n</b><br>This is a major design principle, through which an underlying unity and variety can be achieved. Rhythm is movement. All movement in design is not, however, rhythmic. Sometimes the movement is distracting. In designing, rhythm implies an easy connecting path along which the eye may travel. It may also be called ‘related movement’. If one observes a plain surface, there is usually no movement in it. The eye remains quiet and stops at any point where it happens to fall.\n<br>But the moment a picture or an object is placed against it, the eye starts moving in the direction of the lines suggested in the pattern they make together. At that moment, movement is created. Such a movement may either be organized and easy, that is, rhythmic; or it may be restless and distracting, that is, lacking in rhythm. There are three outstanding ways of developing rhythm in interiors.\n<br>\n<br><b>Harmony\n</b><br>This is the fundamental requirement of any piece of work in which appearance, as well as use, have to be considered. Harmony is the most important of all the principles of design. It is the design principle that produces an expression of unity through the selection and arrangement of discrete objects and ideas. Harmony has five aspects:\n<br>● Harmony of line and shape\n<br>● Harmony of texture\n<br>● Harmony of size\n<br>● Harmony of colours\n<br>● Harmony of Ideas\n<br>\n<br><b>UNITS OF DESIGN\n</b><br>There are four units of design: naturalistic, stylized, geometric, and abstract. An individual design may be based on any one of the units or may contain a combination of two or more units.\n<br>\n<br><b>Naturalistic</b> ‘These represent nature flowers, leaves, fruits, animals, landscapes, and so on. Every effort is made to keep the motifs realistic so that they appear as exact reproductions. These patterns lend themselves to either formal or informal themes.\n<br>\n<br><b>Stylized</b> ‘These designs resemble natural objects, but usually, the lines are simplified and conventionalized. Sometimes they are distorted. The designer uses various degrees of stylization, depending upon the materials employed and the purpose of the article. These motifs may include outsized patterns, for instance, of flowers and other natural forms in colors that are not natural but are intended to create certain effects (warmth, coolness, brightness).\n<br>\n<br><b>Geometric </b>‘These are based on such pure forms as the circle, rectangle, and triangle, although endless variations and combinations of them are used. Geometric motifs include stripes, dots, and checks, as well as many less usual forms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Abstract</b> Many abstract designs are based on geometric forms. ‘Abstract’ implies an element of impressionism and greater freedom than is found in most geometric forms. The shapes and patterns, although derived from the geometric, maybe less rigid and formal than the popular conception of a geometrical design. They are also called ‘non-representational’ because they represent nothing but themselves.<br><br><b>INTERIOR DECORATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Introduction\n</b><br>Interior decoration is a highly personal form of self-expression. It is the sum of one’s interests as an individual or a group, a personal statement created by combining various elements of art by using certain principles.\n<br>\n<br>Colour, lighting, floor coverings and finishes, carpets, ceiling and wall coverings, and various window treatments are some important tools used for decorating various areas of a hotel and giving a distinct style to these areas.\n<br>\n<br><b>MATERIALS USED IN INTERIOR DESIGNS\n</b><br>The elements are components or parts which can be isolated and defined in any visual design or work of art. They are the structure of the work and can carry a wide variety of messages.\n<br>\n<br><b>Factors Determining the choose the materials\n</b><br>\n<br>● Appearance: Colour, pattern and texture of the materials should be compatible with the size, décor and activity of the room. Pale colours provide a cool appearance of warmth. Patterned surfaces add interest to the room.\n<br>● Comfort: Foot fatigue should be reduced by use of soft resilient surfaces.  Floor surfaces should not be noisy or slippery.\n<br>● Durability: Grit, dragging of furniture and placement of equipment or circulation of heavy traffic should not damage the interior surface.  They should also not be affected by the cleaning reagents and food spillages.\n<br>● Life Expectancy: Since interiors are not changed frequently, they are expected to last for a longer time.\n<br>● Safety: Safety to the guests and occupants must be considered.  Fire resistance, slip resistance and accident proof surfaces must be selected.\n<br>● Ease of Cleaning: Ease of maintenance and cleaning costs must be considered while selecting them.\n<br>● Cost: The cost of the interior materials, cost of laying and maintenance should be considered before selection.<br><br><b>Interior Material can be classified\n</b><br><b>1. </b>Floor Finishes\n<br><b>2. </b>Wall Finishes\n<br><b>3.</b> Windows\n<br><b>4.</b> Furniture<br><b>5. </b>Accessories&nbsp;<br><b><br>1. Floor Finishes\n</b><br>\n<br>Flooring is the general term for a permanent covering of a floor, or for the work of installing such a floor covering. Floor covering is a term to generically describe any finish material applied over a floor structure to provide a walking surface. Both terms are used interchangeably but floor covering refers more to loose-laid materials.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Floors Surfaces/Finish\n</b><br>Floor surfaces are divided into two types of hard and soft floors.  A subfloor is laid below the floor surface, which may be made of softwood or hardboard.  It should be free from dampness, dirt and unevenness.  This protects the top floor.\n<br>\n<br><b>HARD FLOOR SURFACES\n</b><br>Stone Floor Surfaces: These are commonly used in areas that must withstand heavy traffic, repeated washing and movement of goods. These floors are extremely durable and hygienic.\n<br>\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Concrete:</b> It is composed of cement and sand. Pigments may be added to provide colour.  This floor can withstand large weights but is damaged by acids and alkalis. It is suitable for stores, sub-floors, laundry, staircase etc. Concrete is extremely porous, hard and soiled easily.  A scaler may be applied to make it stain resistant.  These floors are suitable in halls, lounges, corridors, and bathrooms and as tabletops.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Wooden Floor Surfaces:</b> These floors are used in all types of establishments for corridors, dance floors, bar areas, dining halls, game rooms etc.  They are more attractive than stone but are very porous and easily damaged by moisture and pests.  A ceiling polish must be applied to increase durability. Strips of wood are cut into varying lengths and laid on a subfloor.  The colour of the floor will depend upon the type of wood used.  Oak and teak are the common types of wood used for flooring. Designs can be created by varying the colour of wooden tiles (blocks) and arranging them in different patterns.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Cork Tiles:</b> Cork is obtained from the bark of the cork of oak tree.  It is the least resistant of the hard floor surface.  It is a good insulator, warm, resilient and quite easy to maintain.  It has a high degree of slip resistance but the tiles cannot withstand heavy furniture, grease, and moisture and alkalis.  The colour of natural cork is brown and pigments may be added to obtain other colours e.g. Green.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Resilient Floor Surfaces: </b>These floor surfaces include certain plastics or finishes which make them moisture and grease resilient.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Terrazzo: </b>This consists of marble chips, set in cement.  It may be plain or coloured and ground smooth.  This is not used in small areas but preferred around pools and in gardens.  These floors are porous and damaged by acids, alkalis and grease.  They are unharmed by water and have good slip resistance when polished.  The common colours are white, green, blue and black.\n<br>● <b>Ceramic Tiles:</b> Ceramic tiles are made of clay and fired at high temperature.  They are hand or machine made, glazed and unglazed. Shapes of the tiles may be square, rectangular or hexagonal. Tiles are waterproof and impervious to cleaning liquid.  They are commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry, canteens, bars etc. These floors are hard, noisy and tire the feet.  Ceramic floors should not be polished since that would make it dangerously slippery.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Mosaic:</b> They are made of glass, silica and clay.  They may be set directly on the floor or made as tiles and laid on a subfloor unaffected by pests or fungi and the glass can be retained for a long time.\n<br><b>● Timber:</b> Well-maintained timber floor surfaces provide attractive hygienic, warm and serviceable floors for a long time.  They may be laid as strips, boards or blocks.  Floorboards are made from softwoods while strips are constructed from hardwoods.  The colour of the floor depends upon the natural grain.  A sealer may be applied or a polish given to the wooden floor to make it glossy and dirt resistant.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>ChipBoard: </b>Chipboard is obtained by mixing wood chippings or sawdust with resin or cement at high temperature and pressure.  Unlike timber, it does not warm or split.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Linoleum:</b> This is made up of lignum, i.e. flax and ileum in oil. Ground corkwood, linseed oil and resins (gum) are pressed on to a jute backing.  This is prepared in sheet or tile form.  Plain colours marbling or patterns may be applied for decorative effect. Linoleum may crack if laid on the poor quality subfloor. It is hard wearing, resilient and warm, but may peel, rot and get destroyed by alkalis.  It is non-flammable but burns marks can be seen.  This is suitable for the linen room, store pantry, kitchen stores.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Rubber:</b> Rubber floors are usually made by a combination of natural and synthetic rubber.  They may be laid in sheets or tile form.  They may be coloured and mottled with inlaid patterns.  The floor is hard wearing, resilient, quiet and waterproof.  It is non-slip and maybe grease resistant.  Damage may occur due to alkalis, acids and spirits.  They are not affected by mould, bacteria and pest infestation.  It is commonly used in kitchens, bathrooms, health clubs, near swimming pools etc.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Thermoplastic Floors:</b> These are made of asphalt, fibres, mineral fillers and pigments or synthetic resins with a vinyl binder.  The tiles are usually dark coloured and quite durable.  They have good thermal insulation and are resistant to water.  They are damaged by heat, acids and alkalis.  They are useful in canteens, corridors, shops and offices. PVC may be added to make hard thermoplastic more flexible.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Vinyl:</b> Vinyl is made from asbestos, fibres, mineral pigments and PVC.  They are very hygienic and deal in hospitals, kitchens, dining areas, nurseries, common rooms, lifts etc. They are water and oil resistant and can be made slip resistant.  They are damaged by cleaning gels, high temperature and acids.\n<br>\n<b><br>FLOOR COVERINGS OR SOFT FLOORS\n</b><br>Floor coverings or soft floors are used for variety in colour, texture and design.  They are warm, durable, quiet, slip resistant and economical.  Various types of colourings may be used in different areas depending upon the cost of maintenance, cost of installation, attractiveness and use.  Soft floor coverings commonly consist of two types: Carpets and Rugs.\n<br>\n<br><b>Carpets:</b> Carpets are used extensively in hotels and institutional establishments. The type of carpet selected will depend upon the suitability and traffic in the area.  They may be used in bedrooms, lounges, TV rooms, restaurants, offices and corridors.  A good quality carpet should be able to withstand spillages, cigarette ash and grit.  They must also be resilient to heavy furniture.\n<br>\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Backing:</b> Natural materials like jute, hemp, glue and starch are used with resin, synthetic rubber and polypropylene to form the backing.  A secondary backing may be added to improve resilience.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Pile:</b> The carpet pile absorbs most of the wear.  It should be strong and resilient, shrink- proof, moth proof and flameproof.  The carpet pile is frequently made of blends of fibres.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Wool:</b> Woollen carpets are warm, soft, resilient and do not attract dirt.  However, they are difficult to maintain and quite expensive. They may be blended with 20% nylon.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Acrylic:</b> This is close to wool in appearance, wears well, is warm and resilient but soils easily.  This is not easy to clean and not fire resistant.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Polyester:</b> This is often blended with nylon.  This is waterproof, easy to clean, soft and hard wearing.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Viscose Rayon:</b> This is inexpensive and not hard wearing and is sometimes used in blended carpets along with nylon.&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>2.  INTERIOR WALL FINISHES MATERIAL\n</b><br>\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Wood Panelling\n</b><br>Wood Panelling is one of the numerous interior wall finishes material you can use. It is a decorative treatment done with the wooden panels of a wall in various designs. The material is often used on plywood and wood covered with veneer or laminate. It is not unusual to see this kind of finishing in top class hostel bedrooms.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Tile Cladding\n</b><br>Tile Cladding is one of the common interior wall finishing materials used in decorating homes or offices. There are different kinds of tiles, for example, granite, marble, glazed tiles or vitrified tiles used for tile cladding. \n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Wallpaper\n</b><br>Wallpaper is perhaps the most popular version of the decor of the room. There are different types of wallpaper, from simple paper to vinyl, or even 3D photo wallpaper. The material is selected depending on the room.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Decorative Plaster\n</b><br>For most of us the phrase “wall stucco” is associated with aligning surfaces and other rough work. But today, decorative plaster is a great solution for the original decoration of the room.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Gypsum Plasterboard\n</b><br>Drywall finishing is a good option for almost any room. Moreover, you can use gypsum plasterboard by yourself to make your walls straight. Besides, it won’t take long.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Wall Panels\n</b><br>Most often, you can see the PVC panels in offices, shopping malls, and other commercial establishments. Since plastic is not a natural material. Because of this it is rarely used in the bedroom or living room. But plastic panels will be a great solution for the kitchen or the bathroom since they have all the necessary qualities.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Decorative Stone</b>\n<br>The decorative stone in the apartment is very expensive. Also, you’ll unlikely succeed in applying it on the wall by yourself without the necessary experience, so it is required to refer to specialists. This is perhaps the only negative feature of the material. \n<br>●&nbsp;<b>Painting Wall Finishing\n</b><br>More often use of painting is for exterior decoration of a private house, but it will also be a great solution inside your home. Due to the wide variety of colors, textures, and forms, you can give the room a variety of options for decoration.\n<br><br><b>3. WINDOW AND CURTAINS\n</b><br>Windows has four practical functions. They admit air, light, vision and people to varying degrees. Their design may hide, improved, or accentuated by treatment such as curtains, draperies shades and so on.\n<br>\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>A SINGLE WINDOW</b> a single window is a window with a single frame, it opens either inside or outside.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>DOUBLE SASHED WINDOW</b> this type of window has a sash that can be pushed up and down. Since the part with the glass pane is only half the size of the window frame half of the window will always be left open. This window must be placed such that robbers do not have easy access to it.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>MULLION WINDOW</b> these really consist of a series of windows. Each window can be treated as a separate unit or unified into a single design.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>DORMER WINDOWS</b> are provided in attics under slanting gabled roofs mainly to illuminate the rooms towards the middle of the building.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>SKYLIGHTS</b> these are windows in the ceiling. They are basically there to allow in sunlight. They are left untreated. In cases some treatment is required, custom made, remote controlled, shades are best.\n<br>\n<br><b>BLINDS:</b> blinds are of following types:\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>ROLLER BLINDS:</b> these let in plenty of lights when drawn up. rollers blinds are made up of thick fabric used in conjunction with rollers.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>ROMAN BLINDS:</b> these are made of fabrics attached to chords. When the cords are pull the blind rises up in accordion pleats to form a pelmet. They are heavier and warmer than roller blinds.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>VENETIAN BLINDS:</b> these actually originated in china contrary to the name. They are made up of parallel slats of wood metal or plastic aligned horizontally or vertically. They are usually low in price and some custom designed blinds come in different colours and patterns. The version with very thin slats can have different colours on each side. The thin slatted and vertical versions do better in this respect.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>PINOLEUM BLINDS:</b> these are an inexpensive covering for large windows. They work on the same principle as the venetian blinds except that they close across the window rather than down. They may be mounted on a spring operated roller or moved up and down by cords.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b>BALASTORE BLINDS: </b>these are inexpensive blinds made of strong paper fibre. It is accordion pleated to act like a folding blind. Balusters are perforated with small holes to let light through without glare.\n<br><b>● PLEATED BLINDS:</b> they are made from stronger paper than balusters and have smaller pleats. The paper gives privacy but let sunlight through which is filtered and tinned the colour of the paper. The four most common colours are orange green blue and parchment (natural).\n<br><b>● AUSTRIAN BLINDS:</b> these are ruched fabric. They may be used partially raised and when fully raised they form a decorative pelmet. They are used in banquet halls and large lobbies for a sumptuous effect.\n<br><br><b>4. FURNITURES\n</b><br>In any organization, furniture covers a wide variety of different items, which will be in constant use and yet should retain their overall good appearance. People are seldom as careful of other people’s property as they are of their own and the handling of furniture by large numbers of people results in harder use than if one person was using it all time.\n<br>\n<br><b>Classification of Furniture\n</b><br>● Wooden furniture\n<br>● Wicker and cane furniture\n<br>● Metal furniture\n<br>● Plastic\n<br><b><br>Upholstery Material\n</b><br>The upholstery coverings will to great extent determine the appearance, durability and cost of the piece of furniture and may be made from textiles, i.e. woven fabrics, hide or plastics. The covering required to be:\n<br>● Resistant to abrasion, snagging, creasing, soil and fading,\n<br>● Non-flammable,\n<br>● Non-shading,\n<br>● Pest proof,\n<br>● Easily cleaned\n<br>● Elasticity &amp; resiliency\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Coverings\n</b><br>\n<br><b><i>a.Textiles- Cotton based, Satin, Velvet, Organza, net, Corduroy, Leather\n</i></b><br>● The textile coverings are the types of fibre, yarn and weave used in the production of the fabric.\n<br>● Smooth fabrics, e.g. brocades and damasks of cotton, rayon or synthetic fibres show soiling more but hold dust less than the rougher, textured fabrics of wool, wool/nylon and wool/Evan mixtures. The latter has a warmer appearance, are less slippery and are less likely to show shine on clothes when sat on.\n<br>● Cut and uncut pile fabrics, e.g. velvet, corduroy, or moquette made of wool, cotton, rayon or synthetic fibres are hard wearing but hold the dust, and cut pile fabrics may show shadowing.\n<br>● The use of synthetic fibres, e.g. nylon, dralon etc, either alone or in the mixtures and blends increases the durability and ease of cleaning of many coverings.\n<br>\n<br><b><i>b. Plastic – vinyl\n</i></b><br>There are many plastic materials available. They are more easily cleaned, equally hardwearing and less expensive than leather coverings. They are mainly vinyl.\n<br><b><br>CURTAINS HEADINGS AND ACCESSORIES\n</b><br>A warm room without accessories would be uninteresting. Accessories lend personality, charm and individuality to a room. Each person’s selection and arrangement will reflect his/her own interest and sensitivity to good design. But the accessories should follow the theme of the room. Accessories must contribute towards the unity of the room\n<br>\n<br><b>1. PELMETS AND CORNICES\n</b><br>Cornices are box-like shapes used at the top horizontal portion of the drapery treatment to hide the poles and other hardware. They are generally 4 to 7 inches deep. The width of cornice of a cornice should be a little less than one eighth of the overall length drapery. They may be of wood plastic or mirrored glass. Wooden cornices may be finished in their natural colour painted in some other colour or covered with cloth, cork, leather. Sometimes the covering is covered in brass nails.\n<br>\n<br><b>2. VALENCE\n</b><br>These are made of fabrics that have been plaited, scalloped, or ruffled. They should never exceed one sixth of the windows height and should be about 8 to 12 in inches in depth. The width of lambrequin should be about a seventh of the floor length drapery.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. SWAGS AND CASCADES\n</b><br>Swags are decorative drapery treatment meant to hide the curtains headings and usually taper to a cascade. These loop and fall luxuriously over a curtain pole ending in elaborate tale. Headings of these types are appropriate for large formal rooms with high ceilings. They tend to look so heavy in small or average sized rooms. The depth of the swag at the center after it has been draped should be about one seventh of the drapery length or one seventh of the drapery length or one seventh of the distance between the top of the frame and the floor. The width of the cascade at the top should coincide with the width of the drapery when hung. The length of the cascade should be 2 to 3 inches above its finished width.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. DRAPERY CRANES\n</b><br>These are appropriate hardware to use where installation has to be flexible. On French windows or swinging casement windows this type of drapery rods with its hinged bracket allow the free edge to swing away from the door or window with the casement.\n<br>\n<b><br>5. Books and Magazines \n</b><br>Books and Magazines are not actually accessories but are classified as such when used decoratively or in large quantities in a room. Displaying books adds depth as well as character to a room and reveals the interests of the owner.\n<br>\n<br><b>6. Lamps </b><br>Well-chosen lamps and light fixtures are extremely important in determining the characters of a room. Although the functional aspect should be the primary consideration in selecting them, it is no less important to choose designs that emphasise the spirit of the room.\n<br>\n<br><b>7. Plants and Indoor Trees\n</b><br>Plants and indoor trees can be placed almost anywhere in a home or apartment, provided they receive adequate light and the environment is favourable for their growth. Plants usually grow profusely in the bathrooms due to high humidity. \n<br>\n<br><b>8. Sculpture\n</b><br>Sculptures can be various materials-stones, wood, metal, ivory, pottery, plastic or glass and of various shapes and sizes. When choosing sculptures, one most look for a good design, honest use of materials and quality in reproduction if applicable.\n<br>\n<br><b>9. Wall Hangings\n</b><br>Wall hangings can be made of a number of materials or types. Printed fabric, carpets, macrame, needlework etc. have all served as wall hangings. Wall hangings are often used to fill large, plain, empty areas. They can also be the focal point of a room.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

HVAC systems must be Properly selected, operated, and maintained if they are to provide an appropriate level of comfort. To maintain comfort, you need to understand the basic elements of comfort. The capabilities, limitations, and operating costs of various types of HVAC systems are important as well, especially as they relate to decisions about equipment selection and overall cost control.\n<br>While there are many types of systems, the underlying ways in which they operate are somewhat similar. Knowing how a property creates heating and cooling and provides ventilation will help you to understand the ways in which each of  these is used to help produce building comfort.\n<br>\n<br><b>Factors Influencing Building Thermal Comfort \n</b><br>The concept of comfort involves a number of factors. HVAC Systems maintain thermal comfort by modifying and controlling the factors that influence comfort. These systems use equipment such as furnaces and boilers to produce heat, air conditioners and chillers to produce cold, fans and ductwork to move air, and filters and air washers to clean the air.\n<br>Factors influencing thermal comfort include:\n<br>● Room air temperature\n<br>● Room air movement\n<br>● Relative humidity of room air or wet bulb temperature\n<br>● Activity level in the room\n<br>● Clothing worn by room occupants\n<br>● Temperature of the room surfaces\n<br><br>Most of these factors will seem quite obvious to you. A room’s comfort level can be greatly changed by providing air movement such as with a fan in the summer. A humid environment can be much less comfortable in summer than a dryer environment at the same temperature. If we are actively exercising, we find cooler conditions more comfortable. An individual wearing a suit or sweater will be warmer than he or she would be in a thin short-sleeved shirt and shorts.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Building Loads and Comfort\n</b><br>The exterior wall, windows, and ceiling of the guestroom may add heat to or subtract heat from the space, depending on the season. The windows allow solar energy to enter and add heat to the room. The guest, television, lights, and other equipment add heat to the room. The shower and bath also add heat. Air leakage around the windows (and the door if the guest room opens to the outside) can add cold or hot air to the room, depending on the season. Moisture is added by the bath and shower and by the breath of, and skin evaporation from, room occupants. The bathroom vent fan removes air that must be replaced. This replacement air eventually enters the building from the outside, which means it must be heated or cooled somewhere.\n<br><br><b>Why HVAC system important to the building\n</b><br>HVAC systems are responsible for the regulation of heat, airflow, ventilation, and air conditioning of an entire building. You won’t see the machines when you enter the building but you will most certainly feel the effects of a comfortable and well-ventilated workplace.\n<br>\n<br>Here are some of the reasons why hotels opt to have reliable HVAC systems in place for their office buildings.\n<br>\n<br>● HVAC systems control the overall climate in the building. They also make the proper adjustments whenever we experience changes in outdoor temperature. During the winter season, the HVAC systems (mainly the boilers or heaters) work to keep the indoor temperature at a comfortable level. In hotter times of the season, the HVAC systems regulate air temperature by providing the necessary cooling to keep the entire building comfortable.\n<br>● Having a comfortable work climate increases the level of productivity and increases morale amongst the workers and employees. If you let your people work in settings conducive to work, they will surely be motivated to perform better because they feel good in their work environment. No employee will enjoy working in an office where it is freezing, or in an office where you frequently have to ignore your perspiration just to focus on your computer screen. Having a proper HVAC system installed is guaranteed to make your employees happy, hence, giving you better work results in return.\n<br>● HVAC systems not only regulate the temperature inside the building but also improve the quality of air. The quality of air pertains to humidity, and a typical HVAC system will reduce the amount of humidity in the air so your workers and employees can continue enjoying a cozy and pleasant atmosphere in guest rooms and back areas.\n<br>● Proper HVAC systems are a worthy investment for any business or hotels because it gives you energy savings. HVAC systems today are automated, which means you no longer have to manually adjust the temperature settings or the time settings of each machine. Given that your entire HVAC system operates in an automated system, proper adjustments will be made right when they are needed. This makes your energy consumption more efficient as it gets rid of energy wasted on improper settings.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.\n<br>\n<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was\ncooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.\n<br>\n<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur\nin food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.\n<br>\n<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to\ncreate an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?\n</b><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.\n<br>\n<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARBOHYDRATES</b> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.\nHeat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and\ngelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the\nSugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a\ncaramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.\n<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,\nThe thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.\n<br>\n<br><b>VEGETABLE FIBRE</b> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.\n<br>\n<br><b>PROTEINS</b> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in\ndissolving few connective tissues.\n<br>\n<br><b>FATS</b> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.\n<br>\n<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond\na certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>CONCLUSION\n</b><br>\n<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.\n<br>\n<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:\n<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.\n<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.\n<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.\n<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.\n<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.\n<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.\n<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.\n<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.\n<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.\n<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS TEXTURES\n</b><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:\n<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel\n<br>\n<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.\n<br>\n<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.\n<br>\n<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.\nThis satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.\n<br>\n<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.\n<br><br>● Airy\n<br>● Spongy\n<br>● Jelly\n<br>● Soft\n<br>● Hard / Firm\n<br>● Short\n<br>● Flaky\n<br>● Coarse\n<br>● Heavy\n<br>● Light\n<br>● Grainy\n<br>● Smooth\n<br>● Crispy\n<br>● Crunchy\n<br>● Creamy\n<br>● Chewy\n<br>● Crusty\n<br>● Chunky\n<br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:\n<br><br><b>1) Thick consistency:</b> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.\n<br><b>2) Pouring consistency:</b> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.\n<br><b>3) Thin consistency:</b> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.\n<br><b>4) Frozen consistency:</b> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Fibre</b> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.\n<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components. The amount of fiber varies in different vegetables, for example, tomatoes and spinach have fewer fibers than turnips or carrots. Even the age of vegetables would determine the amount of fiber in it, for example, young baby carrots would have less fiber as compared to older tougher carrots. In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.\n<br>\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the\ncooking time.\n<br>\n<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.\n<br><br><b>Sugars</b> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Starch</b> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.\n<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doneness</b> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.\n<br>\n<br><i>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Do not overcook.\n<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.\n<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.\n<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.\n<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Cooking for a short time.\n<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.\n<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.\n<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.\n<br>\n<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● High heat or temperature\n<br>● Long cooking\n<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching\n<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)\n<br>\n<br><i>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:\n</i><br>\n<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.\n<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.\n<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br><b>1) Washing:</b> to remove dirt.\n<br><b>2) Peeling:</b> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.\n<br><b>3) Pairing:</b> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.\n<br><b>4) Cutting:</b> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)\n<br><b>5) Mincing:</b> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.\n<br><b>6) Shredding:</b> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.\n<br><b>7) Slicing:</b> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.\n<br><b>8) Slitting:</b> example green chilies.\n<br><b>9) Grating:</b> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.\n<br><b>10) Grinding:</b> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.\n<br><b>11) Mashing:</b> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.\n<br><b>12) Pressing:</b> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.\n<br><b>13) Sieving:</b> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.\n<br><b>14) Refining:</b> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.\n<br><b>15) Skimming:</b> removing a floating layer.\n<br><b>16) Rendering:</b> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.\n<br><b>17) Filtration:</b> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.\n<br><b>18) Evaporation and reduction:</b> removal of water without the lid.\n<br><b>19) Homogenization:</b> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).\n<br><b>20) Emulsification:</b> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:\n</b><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.\n<br>\n<br><b>1) Beating:</b> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.\n<br><b>2) Blending:</b> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.\n<br><b>3) Cutting:</b> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.\n<br><b>4) Creaming:</b> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual\nincorporation of sugar as in cake making.\n<br><b>5) Folding:</b> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.\n<br><b>6) Kneading</b>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.\n<br><b>7) Marinating:</b> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.\n<br><b>8) Stirring:</b> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.\n<br><b>9) Whipping:</b> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.\n<br>\n<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was\ncooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.\n<br>\n<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur\nin food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.\n<br>\n<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to\ncreate an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?\n</b><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.\n<br>\n<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARBOHYDRATES</b> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.\nHeat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and\ngelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the\nSugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a\ncaramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.\n<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,\nThe thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.\n<br>\n<br><b>VEGETABLE FIBRE</b> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.\n<br>\n<br><b>PROTEINS</b> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in\ndissolving few connective tissues.\n<br>\n<br><b>FATS</b> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.\n<br>\n<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond\na certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>CONCLUSION\n</b><br>\n<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.\n<br>\n<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:\n<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.\n<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.\n<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.\n<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.\n<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.\n<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.\n<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.\n<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.\n<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.\n<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS TEXTURES\n</b><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:\n<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel\n<br>\n<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.\n<br>\n<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.\n<br>\n<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.\nThis satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.\n<br>\n<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.\n<br><br>● Airy\n<br>● Spongy\n<br>● Jelly\n<br>● Soft\n<br>● Hard / Firm\n<br>● Short\n<br>● Flaky\n<br>● Coarse\n<br>● Heavy\n<br>● Light\n<br>● Grainy\n<br>● Smooth\n<br>● Crispy\n<br>● Crunchy\n<br>● Creamy\n<br>● Chewy\n<br>● Crusty\n<br>● Chunky\n<br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:\n<br><br><b>1) Thick consistency:</b> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.\n<br><b>2) Pouring consistency:</b> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.\n<br><b>3) Thin consistency:</b> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.\n<br><b>4) Frozen consistency:</b> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Fibre</b> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.\n<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components.

In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.\n<br>\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the\ncooking time.\n<br>\n<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.\n<br><br><b>Sugars</b> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Starch</b> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.\n<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doneness</b> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.\n<br>\n<br><i>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Do not overcook.\n<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.\n<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.\n<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.\n<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Cooking for a short time.\n<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.\n<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.\n<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.\n<br>\n<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● High heat or temperature\n<br>● Long cooking\n<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching\n<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)\n<br>\n<br><i>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:\n</i><br>\n<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.\n<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.\n<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br><b>1) Washing:</b> to remove dirt.\n<br><b>2) Peeling:</b> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.\n<br><b>3) Pairing:</b> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.\n<br><b>4) Cutting:</b> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)\n<br><b>5) Mincing:</b> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.\n<br><b>6) Shredding:</b> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.\n<br><b>7) Slicing:</b> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.\n<br><b>8) Slitting:</b> example green chilies.\n<br><b>9) Grating:</b> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.\n<br><b>10) Grinding:</b> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.\n<br><b>11) Mashing:</b> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.\n<br><b>12) Pressing:</b> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.\n<br><b>13) Sieving:</b> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.\n<br><b>14) Refining:</b> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.\n<br><b>15) Skimming:</b> removing a floating layer.\n<br><b>16) Rendering:</b> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.\n<br><b>17) Filtration:</b> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.\n<br><b>18) Evaporation and reduction:</b> removal of water without the lid.\n<br><b>19) Homogenization:</b> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).\n<br><b>20) Emulsification:</b> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:\n</b><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.\n<br>\n<br><b>1) Beating:</b> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.\n<br><b>2) Blending:</b> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.\n<br><b>3) Cutting:</b> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.\n<br><b>4) Creaming:</b> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual\nincorporation of sugar as in cake making.\n<br><b>5) Folding:</b> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.\n<br><b>6) Kneading</b>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.\n<br><b>7) Marinating:</b> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.\n<br><b>8) Stirring:</b> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.\n<br><b>9) Whipping:</b> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.\n<br>\n<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was\ncooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.\n<br>\n<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur\nin food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.\n<br>\n<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to\ncreate an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?\n</b><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.\n<br>\n<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARBOHYDRATES</b> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.\nHeat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and\ngelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the\nSugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a\ncaramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.\n<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,\nThe thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.\n<br>\n<br><b>VEGETABLE FIBRE</b> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.\n<br>\n<br><b>PROTEINS</b> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in\ndissolving few connective tissues.\n<br>\n<br><b>FATS</b> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.\n<br>\n<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond\na certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>CONCLUSION\n</b><br>\n<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.\n<br>\n<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:\n<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.\n<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.\n<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.\n<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.\n<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.\n<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.\n<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.\n<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.\n<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.\n<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS TEXTURES\n</b><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:\n<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel\n<br>\n<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.\n<br>\n<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.\n<br>\n<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.\nThis satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.\n<br>\n<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.\n<br><br>● Airy\n<br>● Spongy\n<br>● Jelly\n<br>● Soft\n<br>● Hard / Firm\n<br>● Short\n<br>● Flaky\n<br>● Coarse\n<br>● Heavy\n<br>● Light\n<br>● Grainy\n<br>● Smooth\n<br>● Crispy\n<br>● Crunchy\n<br>● Creamy\n<br>● Chewy\n<br>● Crusty\n<br>● Chunky\n<br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:\n<br><br><b>1) Thick consistency:</b> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.\n<br><b>2) Pouring consistency:</b> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.\n<br><b>3) Thin consistency:</b> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.\n<br><b>4) Frozen consistency:</b> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Fibre</b> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.\n<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components. The amount of fiber varies in different vegetables, for example, tomatoes and spinach have fewer fibers than turnips or carrots. Even the age of vegetables would determine the amount of fiber in it, for example, young baby carrots would have less fiber as compared to older tougher carrots. In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.\n<br>\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the\ncooking time.\n<br>\n<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.\n<br><br><b>Sugars</b> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Starch</b> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.\n<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doneness</b> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.\n<br>\n<br><i>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Do not overcook.\n<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.\n<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.\n<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.\n<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Cooking for a short time.\n<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.\n<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.\n<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.\n<br>\n<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● High heat or temperature\n<br>● Long cooking\n<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching\n<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)\n<br>\n<br><i>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:\n</i><br>\n<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.\n<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.\n<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br><b>1) Washing:</b> to remove dirt.\n<br><b>2) Peeling:</b> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.\n<br><b>3) Pairing:</b> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.\n<br><b>4) Cutting:</b> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)\n<br><b>5) Mincing:</b> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.\n<br><b>6) Shredding:</b> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.\n<br><b>7) Slicing:</b> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.\n<br><b>8) Slitting:</b> example green chilies.\n<br><b>9) Grating:</b> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.\n<br><b>10) Grinding:</b> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.\n<br><b>11) Mashing:</b> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.\n<br><b>12) Pressing:</b> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.\n<br><b>13) Sieving:</b> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.\n<br><b>14) Refining:</b> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.\n<br><b>15) Skimming:</b> removing a floating layer.\n<br><b>16) Rendering:</b> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.\n<br><b>17) Filtration:</b> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.\n<br><b>18) Evaporation and reduction:</b> removal of water without the lid.\n<br><b>19) Homogenization:</b> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).\n<br><b>20) Emulsification:</b> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:\n</b><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.\n<br>\n<br><b>1) Beating:</b> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.\n<br><b>2) Blending:</b> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.\n<br><b>3) Cutting:</b> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.\n<br><b>4) Creaming:</b> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual\nincorporation of sugar as in cake making.\n<br><b>5) Folding:</b> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.\n<br><b>6) Kneading</b>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.\n<br><b>7) Marinating:</b> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.\n<br><b>8) Stirring:</b> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.\n<br><b>9) Whipping:</b> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

A few can be eaten raw, whereas many have to be cooked before they can be consumed. Not all fruits and vegetables can be eaten raw; similarly, there are many foods that cannot be cooked until they are processed first. We cook food for many reasons, the first and foremost is that we want the food to get easily digested by our system. Then, there can be multiple reasons as to why the food must be cooked in a certain manner and presented in a particular Way.\n<br>\n<br>When the human race was evolving, cavemen discovered that food tastes better when it was\ncooked in the fire. The textures, tastes, colors, and flavors probably would not have been of too much concern to the caveman, but as the social set-up got created and food became art and defined the culture of a society, people started to experiment with ingredients and when food started to sell as a commodity, people wanted food in a particular manner as they were paying for the same. With the rise in competition and to sustain the business, chefs started to create possibilities with different ingredients and this phenomenon continues to this day.\n<br>\n<br>Every ingredient reacts differently to heat. There are physical as well as chemical changes that occur\nin food and have an impact upon the texture, flavor, color, and nutrients, which determines the final product. Cooking is the application of heat to food in order to make it safe to eat, digestible, more palatable, and to change its appearance. The heat has to be applied to food in order to cook it. Heat also breaks down the cellulose and the starches present, changes and blends flavors within the food, and also destroys bacteria in order to make food more digestible for humans.\n<br>\n<br>It is important to know how heat and temperature affect these commodities and this will help us to\ncreate an array of dishes with different kinds of textures and consistencies.\n<br>\n<br><b>WHY DO WE NEED TO COOK FOOD?\n</b><br>To understand different types of textures, it is first important for budding chefs to know what are the factors that cause these changes in the texture of food.\n<br>\n<br>Vegetables and fruits are composed of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and water, and also a small number of minerals, vitamins, pigments (coloring agents), and flavor elements. The effect that heat has on each of these components is miraculous. Even the same ingredient cooked with a different cooking method alters the way it feels in the mouth. A potato mash must be light and fluffy, and a potato chip must be crisp and should snap between the teeth. The cake sponge must be light and airy, and a crusty bread must be crunchy from the outside and soft inside. All these words such as soft, airy, light, crisp, and hard refer to the texture of the food or an ingredient. The methods of cooking, time and duration of cooking, the way an ingredient is processed, the cooking medium used are all techniques employed by chefs to create various types of textures and mouthfeel for the ultimate experience. The application of heat has different effects on different nutrients present in the food. For example, when heated, proteins in a protein-rich food react in a different way as compared to carbohydrates, fibers, and even vitamins present in it.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARBOHYDRATES</b> Both sugar and starches are carbohydrates and both of them are present in many forms in vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, and nuts.\nHeat plays a very important role when applied to vegetables in terms of caramelization and\ngelatinization. Caramelization is the browning of sugars. When a liquid is mixed with starch, the\nSugars present in them dissolve in water and then upon heating the sugars turn brown thus giving a\ncaramelized appearance. The browning of sautéed vegetables or browning of roti or naan is all forms of caramelization.\n<br>When starch absorbs water and swells then the process is known as gelatinization. For example,\nThe thickening of a white sauce with a roux or a Chinese sauce with cornstarch.\n<br>\n<br><b>VEGETABLE FIBRE</b> Fibre is the name for a group of complex substances known as cellulose that gives structure and firmness to plants. This fiber cannot be digested. The softening of vegetables on the application of heat is a result of the breaking down of fibers. Some ingredients that are alkaline in nature such as baking soda react with brass and make their texture soft and mushy and on the other hand, few acidic ingredients such as vinegar make the fibers crisp and firm to eat.\n<br>\n<br><b>PROTEINS</b> Proteins are present to a smaller extent in vegetables as compared to meat, fish, and poultry. As heat is applied to proteins, they become firm or they start to coagulate; with an increase in temperature, proteins become even firmer and start to shrink. If proteins are exposed to very high heat then heat toughens them and makes them dry.\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products help in speeding up coagulation and in\ndissolving few connective tissues.\n<br>\n<br><b>FATS</b> Fats play a very important part in cooking. Water has a boiling temperature of 100° C, but fats and oils can be heated to very high temperatures ranging between 130° C and 200° C. ‘This unique property of fats helps us to cook the food very fast and also these high temperatures pull out moisture from the surface of the food and help to make crispy textures. Fish cutlets, fish and chips, French fries are all examples of such dishes.\n<br>\n<br>One has to be very careful while working with fats and oils as overheating of a fat or an oil beyond\na certain temperature can cause the oil to smoke and then catch fire. This is also known as the flashpoint. When the oil keeps reaching the smoking point multiple times, it starts to break down into fatty acids and glycerol. Then upon further heating, the glycerol breaks down to further harmful compounds that cause cancer and problems to our digestive system.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>CONCLUSION\n</b><br>\n<br>The aim or the intention of cooking is to see that the food cooked undergoes a physical change, sometimes a chemical change, and is acceptable.\n<br>\n<br>The objective of cooking is to achieve certain results such as:\n<br>1) To facilitate and fasten digestion so that the cooked food is absorbed by the digestive system and subsequently assimilated by the body.\n<br>2) A physical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, but still remains that same substance, like water that changes to ice.\n<br>3) A chemical change occurs when a substance changes its form, color, or size, combining so as to form an entirely new body, e.g. milk changes to curd.\n<br>4) Cooking partly sterilize food above 40*c, so that the growth of bacteria falls off rapidly and boiling kills the living cells.\n<br>5) Cooking makes food more attractive to have eye appearance and variety.\n<br>6) Cooking increases taste and palatability.\n<br>7) Cooking helps to make food more digestible.\n<br>8) With one ingredient many dishes can be prepared.\n<br>9) Use the right cooking method so that there is minimum loss of color, texture, and nutrition.\n<br>10) Use various ingredients to provide a balanced diet.\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, when we have understood how heat impacts the nutrients in the food, thereby changing the textures in the food, let us understand the textures and what they mean in food.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>VARIOUS TEXTURES AND CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS TEXTURES\n</b><br>It is the term to describe the characteristics of the finished products such as:\n<br>1) Appearance 2) Feel to touch 3) Mouthfeel\n<br>\n<br>We often hear the word ‘texture’ in everyday lives. When we touch or feel something, we have different experiences. Some things are soft to touch whereas some are rough, smooth, silky, etc. This quality of touch is known as texture. Food ingredients also have texture and the versatility of this is that as a chef, we can alter the texture of an ingredient by applying a cooking process or methodology to create an array of tantalizing textures that can create an experience for the diner. Imagine having a khichdi without a poppadom. Obviously, a poppadom will appeal to a majority of people because of the texture changes in the mouth. This is commonly known as mouthfeel.\n<br>\n<br>The food must appeal to all the five senses of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound. There is, however the sixth sense that is often known as umami in Japan. This is the taste that cannot be described. It is the taste from mushrooms, onions, and Ajinomoto used in Chinese cuisine. It will be hard to classify the taste like salty, sweet, bitter, etc. So in reality, good food creates an experience when it appeals to all the five senses and especially the sixth sense.\n<br>\n<br>The food must look appetizing, should smell pleasant, and should have a great texture and taste.\nThis satisfies four senses such as sight, smell, touch, and taste. What about the sound? How shall we look at satisfying the sense of sound in food? Well, here is where textures play an important part. The crisp texture on fish and chips or crumb-fried chicken, roasted poppadom, or even a thick slice of onion can be satisfying to the sense of sound with chat crisp and brittle textures.\n<br>\n<br>The textures mentioned in the above table can be mixed and interestingly, chefs use this skill to create various textures on the plate, which in turn surprises the customer. Many of these textures can be attained by using various cooking techniques and methods. Let us see how chefs are able to control the textures and what is the science behind these textures.\n<br><br>● Airy\n<br>● Spongy\n<br>● Jelly\n<br>● Soft\n<br>● Hard / Firm\n<br>● Short\n<br>● Flaky\n<br>● Coarse\n<br>● Heavy\n<br>● Light\n<br>● Grainy\n<br>● Smooth\n<br>● Crispy\n<br>● Crunchy\n<br>● Creamy\n<br>● Chewy\n<br>● Crusty\n<br>● Chunky\n<br>\n<br><b>VARIOUS CONSISTENCIES\n</b><br>Generally, the “consistency” word refers to the makeup of the gravies as used in various cuisines such as Indian cuisine or various other preparations such as soups, sauces, batters, and the word consistency is generally used to the materials containing liquid as a major ingredient- various kinds of consistencies are:\n<br><br><b>1) Thick consistency:</b> for example, in soups such as cream of tomato, cream of peas, puree soups, velouté, bisques, and various sauces such as tomato, hollandaise, mayonnaise, etc.\n<br><b>2) Pouring consistency:</b> the best examples of pouring consistencies are batters, pancake batters, etc.\n<br><b>3) Thin consistency:</b> for example, consommés and broth have got thin consistencies.\n<br><b>4) Frozen consistency:</b> for example, in jellies and ice creams where the particles are connected to each other very strongly and hence are unable to flow freely and have got a very thick consistency.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>CONTROLLING THE CHANGES IN TEXTURE AND TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br>\n<br><b>Fibre</b> Fibre structure in vegetables including cellulose and pectin gives them shape and firmness.\n<br>Cooking helps in softening some of these components. The amount of fiber varies in different vegetables, for example, tomatoes and spinach have fewer fibers than turnips or carrots. Even the age of vegetables would determine the amount of fiber in it, for example, young baby carrots would have less fiber as compared to older tougher carrots. In some vegetables, for example, asparagus, the tip would have less fiber content than its stalk.\n<br>\n<br>Acids such as lemon juice, vinegar, and tomato products make fiber firmer and also increase the\ncooking time.\n<br>\n<br>Fiber is softened by heat which means, the longer you apply heat to vegetables, the softer it becomes. Although the vegetables become softer with the addition of alkalis such as baking soda but this should be avoided as it makes vegetables mushy.\n<br><br><b>Sugars</b> strengthen the cell structure and make the fiber firm. This is more applicable for fruits as apples for applesauce should be cooked and then sweetened but on the other hand, the pears or apples where their shape has to be retained should be cooked in heavy syrup.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Starch</b> is another component of vegetables that affects the texture. Dry starchy foods such as dried legumes, beans, lentils, peas, rice, and macaroni products must be cooked with insufficient amounts of water so that starch granules can absorb moisture and soften. Dried beans are often soaked before Seeing to replace the lost moisture.\n<br>Moist starchy vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes have enough moisture of their own, but still, they must be cooked until starch granules soften.\n<br>\n<br><b>Doneness</b> A vegetable is said to be done when it reaches a desired degree of tenderness. This Varies from vegetable to vegetable and most of the vegetables taste best when they are still firm. Which is known as al dente in Italian cuisine. At this stage of tenderness, not only the vegetables get the most pleasing texture but also they retain maximum flavor, color, and nutrients.\n<br>\n<br><i>For proper doneness and texture some rules must be followed:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Do not overcook.\n<br>● Cook as close to service as possible.\n<br>● In case, vegetables have to be pre-cooked then they should be undercooked, refreshed in cold water, and refrigerated. Then, they should be reheated and served.\n<br>● Cuts of vegetables should be uniform in order for them to cook evenly.\n<br>● Different vegetables should be cooked differently at different times.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling changes in flavor Many flavors are lost during cooking, the longer the vegetable is cooked the more flavor it loses. Flavor loss can be controlled by:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● Cooking for a short time.\n<br>● Addition of salt in boiling water as it helps in the reduction of loss of flavor.\n<br>● Use as little liquid as possible in order to minimize leaching.\n<br>● Steaming helps in reducing leaching out of flavors and reduces cooking time also.\n<br>\n<br>Overcooking produces flavor changes, which are undesirable and which result in strong and unpleasant flavors. Younger vegetables have more amount of sugar that changes to starch as and when they grow and lie in storage. This happens usually in carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, etc.\n<br>\n<br><i>Controlling nutrient loss Factors responsible for nutrient loss are as follows:\n</i><i><br></i><br>● High heat or temperature\n<br>● Long cooking\n<br>● Too much liquid causes leaching\n<br>● Use of alkalis (baking soda, hard water)\n<br>\n<br><i>Some nutrient loss in vegetables is inevitable but few tips to reduce nutrient loss are:\n</i><br>\n<br>● The use of pressure steam reduces cooking time but at the same time, the high heat causes some nutrient loss.\n<br>● Braising uses low heat but extends the cooking time.\n<br>● Boiling is faster than simmering but again high heat can destroy the vegetable.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PRE-PREPARATION\n</b><br><b>1) Washing:</b> to remove dirt.\n<br><b>2) Peeling:</b> scraping off the skin of vegetables and fruits.\n<br><b>3) Pairing:</b> removing the surface layer in a circular motion by pressure of a knife-edge all around the object.\n<br><b>4) Cutting:</b> into small pieces by knife (slicing, dicing, shredding, etc.)\n<br><b>5) Mincing:</b> cutting into very small pieces like mutton/onion.\n<br><b>6) Shredding:</b> cutting into long narrow pieces by means of a shredding knife for example cabbage.\n<br><b>7) Slicing:</b> cutting into thin pieces but not as fine as shredding.\n<br><b>8) Slitting:</b> example green chilies.\n<br><b>9) Grating:</b> reducing into small particles by rubbing on a rough surface.\n<br><b>10) Grinding:</b> reducing into small pieces but by crushing for example in masala.\n<br><b>11) Mashing:</b> breaking up of soft food by the application of pressure.\n<br><b>12) Pressing:</b> separating a liquid portion from solids for example cheese preparation.\n<br><b>13) Sieving:</b> passing through a fine wire mesh to remove dirt and impurities. It also helps to entrap air for example sieving of flour.\n<br><b>14) Refining:</b> freeing any material from impurities for example sugar.\n<br><b>15) Skimming:</b> removing a floating layer.\n<br><b>16) Rendering:</b> separating the fat of animals from their connective tissue by heat.\n<br><b>17) Filtration:</b> separating solids from liquids through fine mashed materials as in filtering fruit juices or jelly through cloth bags.\n<br><b>18) Evaporation and reduction:</b> removal of water without the lid.\n<br><b>19) Homogenization:</b> subdividing large particles into smaller ones by forcing them into aperture with great pressure (fat increases).\n<br><b>20) Emulsification:</b> dispersing one liquid into another which is insoluble in each other for example mayonnaise.\n<br>\n<br><b>TECHNIQUES USED IN PREPARATION:\n</b><br>Techniques used in the preparation generally aim at combining or mixing various food materials. Various foods are combined according to palatability and acceptance. Texture and flavor are controlled to an important degree by skill and method employed in combining component material.\n<br>\n<br><b>1) Beating:</b> mixing the materials briskly and dropping them with an appropriate tool. Sometimes it is used as synonyms with whipping.\n<br><b>2) Blending:</b> mixing two or more ingredients thoroughly.\n<br><b>3) Cutting:</b> it is the incorporation of fat in flour and other sifted dry ingredients with a knife. This method produces a coarse division of fat and does not result in blending as in cutting the fat into the mixture.\n<br><b>4) Creaming:</b> softening fat by a fraction with a spoon, usually followed by gradual\nincorporation of sugar as in cake making.\n<br><b>5) Folding:</b> mixing various materials with a palette knife/wooden spoon, by a careful lifting and dropping motion as in whipped egg whites into a cake mixture.\n<br><b>6) Kneading</b>: manipulating by alternating pressure with folding and stretching as in kneading bread dough. A method of combination of water and flour proteins to make gluten.\n<br><b>7) Marinating:</b> coating the surface of a material with marinade which is generally a mixture of oil and acid to soften up the fibers.\n<br><b>8) Stirring:</b> mixing materials with an appropriate tool.\n<br><b>9) Whipping:</b> rapid beating with a whisker or mechanical beater usually to incorporate air as in whipping egg white.&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Staying inside will become very uncomfortable and the organic matter would also deteriorate in quality under such conditions. The purpose of ventilation is to provide controlled air to such spaces to prevent unpleasant conditions of internal air. Proper ventilation can provide a very comfortable interior environment to such spaces. Ventilation is, thus, necessary for public areas, guest rooms, banquet halls, kitchen, and other stores. However, it is to be borne in mind that a substantial amount of energy is expended to move a large volume of air through various units in the ventilation route for the purpose.\n<br>\n<br>Ventilation is, thus, about helping air to circulate inside rooms and public areas in the hotel. It allows moisture and airborne pollutants to escape, and fresh, clean air to be drawn into the desired space. Well-designed ventilation provides cooling in summer. In winter, it lets stale air out to keep warmth in. There could be two basic mechanisms for ventilation, namely \n<br>(a) natural circulation (also called passive ventilation) as air flows naturally through doors and windows and \n<br>(b) mechanical ventilation using fans to drive air in and fans to extract air out in the ventilation system of a given space.\n<br>\n<br><b>CONDITIONS OF COMFORT AND VENTILATION SYSTEM\n</b><br>The feeling of comfort for persons inhabiting a space depends largely on the following factors.\n<br>\n<br>● Amount of oxygen available for easy breathing\n<br>● Speed and distribution of air passing around them\n<br>● Quantity of dirt, smoke, and odour in the room\n<br>●Humidity or amount of moisture in the air\n<br>●Temperature\n<br><br>The purpose and design of a good ventilation system are to provide optimal conditions of comfort. Not all spaces in an establishment require the same degree of control for all the factors of comfort. For example, a kitchen may not have close control on temperature, odour, and smoke, while a banquet hall may have very close control of almost all the factors of comfort. Ventilation, thus, has\nto perform the following functions for complete control of the factors of comfort:\n<br><br>1. Supply of fresh air to\n<br>(a) Replenish oxygen in the space\n<br>(b) Remove smoke and odour\n<br>(c) Carry away the heat given off by human body, organic matter, and heat appliances in a kitchen\n<br>2. Proper distribution of air at different spaces inside an establishment through sound design of ducting\n<br>3. Control of temperature by air cooling/heating arrangement\n<br>4. Control of humidity as a part of air-conditioning system\n<br>5. Control of dirt by using filters in the air intake system\n<br>\n<br><b>TYPES OF VENTILATION\n</b><br><b>1. </b>Natural Ventilation\n<br>● Cross Ventilation\n<br><b>2. </b>Mechanical Ventilation (Artificial)\n<br>● Balanced Ventilation\n<br>● Supply Ventilation\n<br>● Exhaust Ventilation\n<br>● Plenum Ventilation\n<br>\n<br><b>Natural Ventilation\n</b><br>Ventilation provided in the building for the entry of fresh air through the door, windows ventilators. It’s called natural ventilation . It’s natural ventilation whatever the external conditions are their same things will be maintained inside the building also. The advantage of natural ventilation is free and no additional devices are required to treat the air.\n<br>\n<br><b>Cross Ventilation\n</b><br>In this method of natural ventilation the openings such as windows or ventilators are provided in the adjacent walls or opposite walls so that fresh air can enter from one side of the opening and the used air can go out from the other end.\n<br>\n<br><b>The balanced system</b> \n<br>It uses a fan to supply air to the interior and another one to remove air from the interior. In many ventilation systems, a lot of energy is saved by a design where a part of the return air from various rooms (already cold/hot and relatively free from dirt albeit a little less fresh) is mixed with fresh air intake.\n<br>\n<br><b>The supply-only system \n</b><br>It uses one or more fans called ‘forced draught’ fans to supply air to the building interior, relying on exfiltration outflow through doors, crevices, etc. to remove air from the building. The air inlet is generally at a high level with louvers that are adjusted to prevent downward draught of cold air.\n<br>\n<br><b>The exhaust-only system \n</b><br>It uses one or more fans called ‘induced draught’ fans to draw air out of the building interior, relying on infiltration or inflow through doors, crevices, etc. to provide the make-up air supply required.\n<br>\n<br><b>Plenum Ventilation\n</b><br>A system of mechanical ventilation in which fresh air is forced into the spaces to be ventilated from a chamber (plenum chamber ) at a pressure slightly higher than atmospheric pressure, so as to expel foul air. This ventilation is used in cinema halls, multiplex, banquet halls to provide the fresh air supply.\n<br>There are two types of Plenum Ventilation\n<br>● Upward Plenum\n<br>● Downward Plenum\n<br>\n<br><b>Upward Plenum\n</b><br>In upward plenum fresh air is forced into the building through the ducks which are fitted at the lower level of buildings and the utilised air is removed through the outlets which are fitted below the ceilings wall. In this process the air force pattern is upward and hence the name upward plenum process.\n<br>\n<br><b>Downward Plenum\n</b><br>In this type of ventilation air is forced into the building through the ducks which are fitted at the higher level (below ceiling level) and utilized air is removed through the ducks which are fitted at the lower level of the building.\n<br>In this process the air force pattern is downward and hence the name downward plenum process.\n<br><br><b>VENTILATION AIR QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS\n</b><br>Depending on the exact nature of space to be ventilated, building codes and ventilation engineering handbooks provide the standards for requirements of fresh air in the space. Fresh air requirement to replenish is only 20 percent of the air needed to remove body odour. So, the amount of fresh air needed is usually based on the requirement to remove odour and the heat generated inside the room. Kitchen requirement usually would not be guided by the requirement of providing an\n<br>odour-free environment.\n<br>\n<br>1. Room-volume basis\n<br>2. Floor-area basis\n<br>3. Occupant-based method, and\n<br>4. Equipment-based method\n<br>\n<br><b>Room-volume Basis\n</b><br>As the name suggests, room-volume basis specifies air requirements for 1 cu m of room volume. Codes usually specify the requirements in terms of number of air changes per hour. One air change is equal to the introduction of fresh air of volume equal to the volume of the room. Thus, if the size of the room is 5 m x 6 m X 3 m (volume being 90 cu m) and if the code specifies that the particular room needs 20 air changes per hour, it would mean that 20 x 90 cu m of air has to be introduced into the room every hour. Some codes specify this requirement not on the basis of gross volume of room space but on the free air space available therein. The number of air changes per hour required for the room depends upon the type of activity being carried on in the room. \n<br>\n<br><b>Floor-area Ventilation Method\n</b><br>The second common procedure involves calculation of fresh air requirements on the basis of gross floor area. A common figure could be 3 cu m of fresh air per hour per square meter of floor area.\n<br>\n<br><b>Occupant-based Method\n</b><br>In this method, the fresh air requirement is specified on the basis of volume of fresh air needed per hour per person. The volume of fresh air needed per person per hour depends on the air space available for each person. Clearly, if free air space available is more per person, the fresh air needed is less. This requirement further depends upon whether or not smoking is permitted in the space. For example, a space where 3 cu m of air space is available per person, the fresh air requirement is 60 cu m per hour per person for non-smoking zone (82 cu m for smoking zone), whereas a space where each person has 12 cu m of air space available inside the room, the fresh air requirement drops to 22 cu m per hour per person for non-smoking zone (30 cu m for smoking zone). The minimum requirement as specified in different building codes range from 18 cu m per hour per person to 21.5 cu m per hour per person.\n<br><br><b>Equipment-based Method\n</b><br>In spaces such as kitchen, stores, machine room, boiler, engine room, and laundries, factors such as the number, size, power consumption, safety requirements, heat potential of the equipment as also the moisture given off by the equipment could be the appropriate basis of calculation of fresh air requirement. The requirement could be specified either per unit of equipment or per net sq m occupied by the equipment. This figure would again vary depending on the type of equipment based on the factors as mentioned.\n<br>\n<br><b>SCHEMES OF VENTILATION SYSTEM\n</b><br>There are many schemes of operations and related installation layout for ventilation systems. They can be classified as follows:\n<br>\n<br>1. Central ventilation system with complete central control\n<br>2. Central ventilation system with separate heating/cooling control for each room/space\n<br>3. Separate ventilation system for each room\n<br>4. Zonal ventilation system\n<br>\n<br><b>Central Ventilation System with Complete Central Control\n</b><br>A central ventilation system includes all sorts of air condition controls such as heating, cooling, humidity control, and dust control. However, a particular estate may not decide to install all the conditioning elements in its ventilation system. This arrangement economizes on the power requirement as the return air is relatively cleaner and cooler/hotter, as the case may be, than fresh\nair and to put it in simple words, it is to a large extent already conditioned except for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide and odour.\n<br>The important features of central ventilation systems are as follows:\n<br>● There is continuous air (cold/hot, etc.) movement through all the rooms whether or not the rooms are occupied. Even if only one room is occupied, the entire system must be operated to provide ventilation to that room.\n<br>● Only one set of equipment for each function (for example, one fan, one cooler/one heater, one dehumidifier/one humidifier, one air filter, etc.) is required for the purpose.\n<br>\n<br>An analysis of these features indicates that though the capital cost of a central ventilation system may be less, its running cost tends to be high, and it lacks selective control of conditions for different spaces.\n<br>\n<br><b>Central Ventilation System with Separate Heating/Cooling Control for each Room/Space\n</b><br>This system introduces control on selective cooling/heating of rooms while retaining\nthe essential features of a central ventilation system. Although whenever a room is not occupied, the particular heating/cooling unit can be put off, it still circulates fresh air inside unoccupied rooms causing energy and money wastage.\n<br>\n<br><b>Separate Ventilation System for each Room\n</b><br>This system is opposite to the concept of central ventilation system and provides for local fans and other components for ventilation for each room/space. The major advantage is that each room/space can be closely controlled for ventilation requirements. However, the total cost of components is liable to go up as also the cost of carrying large inventory goes up.\n<br>\n<br><b>Zonal Ventilation System</b>\n<br>This is a compromise between local and central systems of ventilation. Separate independent ventilations units are provided for all the rooms/spaces in a particular zone. A zone could be a floor, or a wing, or a building depending on the size, importance of the rooms/space, and level of control desired. If there are some guest rooms still available in zone I while rooms in zone II are all vacant (and hence ventilation systems there not put on operation), a new guest should be encouraged to take room in zone I instead of zone II to economize on costly energy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><br>Factors Affecting Ventilation System Design and Performance \n</b><br>Various factors that affect the design. selection and performance are the following:\n<br><br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Type of space being served</i></b> A kitchen should be ventilated by an extraction fan to prevent spread of odour to other rooms. while in public rooms, storehouses. should be ventilated by inlet fans forcing fresh air free of any odour.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Number of probable occupants</i></b> Bedrooms can have less air changes per hour than a kitchen or a boiler house.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Amount of dust and pollutants in free air</i> </b>This affects the efficiency of cleaning of the filter units in a ventilation system.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Type of gas being ventilated out</i></b> Exhaust outlets from areas that may be contaminated by noxious dust, fumes, steam, gases, odour or other contaminants harmful to people should be placed above the roof level. The discharge to the atmosphere should be located as far as possible, usually not less than 8 m from any operable window, door, and/or outdoor intake for a fan.\n<br>●&nbsp;<b><i>Types of space to be ventilated on a particular floor</i></b> If a particular floor has all different types of requirements for different space, a locally controlled system is advisable, while if the floor contains space that can be grouped together according to the ventilation needs, such as a number of guest rooms on a particular floor, it can be served by a dedicated ventilation system with common control.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

This includes circulating air in a room, filtering air, cooling or heating air humidifying or dehumidifying air. Complete air conditioning would mean all such processes being carried on air in a ventilation system. Normally, when we say the space is air conditioned, we mean the air is cooled. Cooling of air can be through evaporative cooling, for example, when air flows over a bucket of ice- cold water, the water gets evaporated due to air convection and draws its latent heat required for evaporation from air, which in turn gets cooled air or through heat exchange with refrigerated water from a refrigeration plant. Again, usually air is cooled in air-conditioning units by using refrigerated water and hence a refrigeration plant is necessary for such air-conditioning systems. Before we understand the utility of all the components therein, we recall that temperature and humidity are two very important conditions for feeling of comfort. \n<br>As such, we define and explain a few terms for the basic understanding of the science of air conditioning.\n<br>\n<br><b>Terminologies used in Air Conditioning\n</b><br><b>• Psychrometry –</b> The study and measurement of the properties of air and water vapour mixture is known as psychrometry.\n<br><b>• Dry Air –</b> Atmospheric air consisting of a mixture of gases excluding its water vapour content is known as dry air.\n<br><b>• Moisture –</b> The water vapour contained in air is called moisture.\n<br><b>• Moist Air –</b> Atmospheric air along with gases and water vapour is known as moist air.\n<br><b>• Unsaturated Air –</b> The moist air which does not contain the maximum amount of water vapour that it can hold at a given temperature is known as unsaturated air.\n<br><b>• Saturated Air –</b> The mist air which contains the maximum amount of water vapour that it can hold at a given temperature, is known as saturated air.\n<br><b>• Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT) –</b> The reading of temperature of air given by an ordinary mercury thermometer, having its bulb dry and not under the sun or other heat radiating objects.\n<br><b>• Dew Point Temperature (DPT) –</b> At atmospheric temperature atmospheric air always contains water in the form of vapours .If this air is cooled down, the water vapour is turned into water droplets. This temperature at which the water vapours turns into water droplets is called dew point temperature.\n<br><b>• Wet Bulb Temperature (WBT) –</b> Temperature of air indicated by a mercury thermometer whose bulb is covered by a piece of wet muslin is known as wet bulb temperature.\n<br><b>• Specific Humidity (SH) -</b> It is defined as the total quantity of water vapour in the moist air.\n<br><b>• Relative Humidity (RH) -</b> It is defined as the ratio of actual moist air content of a given volume at a particular temperature to the maximum amount of water vapour if the air is saturated at the same temperature.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of Air Conditioning\n</b><br><b>•</b> Centralized air – conditioning System\n<br><b>• </b>Unit Air conditioner\n<br><b>a.</b> Window type units\n<br><b>b. </b>Split type units<b><br></b><br><b>CENTRAL AIR-CONDITIONING\n</b><br>Central air conditioning (or central A/C) is a system in which air is cooled at a central location and distributed to and from rooms by one or more fans and ductwork. The work of the air conditioner compressor is what makes the whole process of air conditioning possible. The compression of the refrigerant gas enables it to discharge heat out of the buildings, which is how the cool air is created.\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

FRESH AIR INLET –</b> It admits fresh air through a louver/grille situated on an outside wall very much away from the kitchen, boiler house and water closet (WC) outlets.\n<br><b>2. FILTERS –</b> It is employed to arrest suspended particulate matter such as dirt and dust from inlet air.\n<br><b>3. AIR WASHERS –</b> This is the air – conditioning section which comprises the pre-heater coil, refrigerating coil and banks of water sprays. The functions of air washers are to control humidity and clean air.\n<br><b>4. SCRUBBER PLATES –</b> These are a series of zigzag plates with a stream of water running down them and are used to catch the dirt-laden water droplets coming out from the water spray section in the air washer.\n<br><b>5. WATER ELIMINATOR PLATES –</b> These are a series of dry zigzag plates to remove any remaining free moisture in the air stream.\n<br><b>6. MIST ELIMINATOR –</b> It is a metallic / non-metallic bed through which air is flown upwards. Fine mist is trapped in the bed and falls down as they coalesce (combine) to bigger size.\n<br><b>7. AIR HEATER -</b> This is composed of heating coils to bring the air up to the desirable room temperature, if necessary.\n<br><b>8. INLET FAN –</b> It is a fan for drawing air through the inlet, ducting and forcing it into the various spaces in the building.\n<br><b>9. FRESH AIR INLET/LOUVERS –</b> They are fitted in the inlet of the fresh air for uniform entry of fresh air and hence smooth mixing with return air before entry to the air conditioning section.\n<br><b>10. ROOM INLET GRILLES –</b> One or more grilles in each room for the controlled inflow of air.\n<br><b>11. ROOM EXTRACTION GRILLES –</b> One or more grilles in each room for the outflow of air. One to discharge outside into the atmosphere and another leading back to the AC plant inlet for the re-circulation.\n<br><b>12. EXTRACTION FAN –</b> It is the fan for extracting air in the return path of the air ducting coming back from rooms and spaces.\n<br><b>13. CENTRAL EXTRACTION DAMPER –</b> In case where complete central control is exercised a part of the return air from all spaces is discharged to the atmosphere through a control damper valve in the delivery side of the extractor fan.\n<br><b>14. DUCTING –</b> Ducting is a term used to denote the passage for flow of air from the AC plant through various passages in the building opening into the closed space to be cooled and return to the inlet ducting in the AC plant. This also includes the ducting for exhaust to the atmosphere.\n<br>\n<br><b>Controls in AC systems\n</b><br>Air-conditioning control essentially involves control of temperature and humidity. These controls are effected through thermostats and humidistats, which sense the temperature and humidity of air, respectively and send control signals for corrective actions. Corrective actions include controlling (a) the temperature of air heaters, (b) the temperature of water spray, (c) the operation of refrigeration plants, and (d) the amount of recirculated air (by controlling the damper opening). Different rooms and spaces may require different conditions of air. For example, bedroom and banquet halls should have different requirements of air quality and conditions. The number of occupants should also be a factor in determining the individual requirements. Control can be achieved by any of the following three methods.\n<br>\n<br>1. There is complete central control where the central unit does everything and the whole building receives air at the same uniform temperature and humidity conditions\n<br>\n<br>2. Instead of installing the components of air washer and eliminator in the central plant, these units are located at each room so that the conditions can be controlled very locally.\n<br>\n<br>3. Instead of locating the air-washer components and eliminator for each room, spaces with similar requirements are grouped and separate controls with one set of components consisting of fan, filter, and cooling/heating coil is installed for each such zone.\n<br>\n<br><b>Importance Points to be noted Centralised Air Conditioning Plant\n</b><br>\n<br>● The central air conditioning plants or the systems are used when large buildings, hotels, theatres, airports, shopping malls etc. are to be air conditioned completely.\n<br>● The air conditioning system operates essentially in a closed cycle.\n<br>● Return air from different spaces in the property such as lodging rooms, dining areas, stores, banquet halls, kitchen etc. comes back through the return duct drawn by what is known as an extraction fan or exhauster.\n<br>● This return air although a little stale is still cold/hot and relatively free from dirt and other contaminants present in fresh air.\n<br>● Instead of exhausting the entire return gas out and sucking in fresh air only, it is returned to the circuit to minimize energy requirement for cooling/heating and filtration.\n<br>\n<br><br><b>Unit Air Conditioners – Window Type AC\n</b><br>These are small self contained cabinet style units. The units are made small enough to fit into a standard window frame. Almost all the components of a central air conditioning plant and the refrigeration plants are corporate within the cabinet. The refrigeration plants (small enough to be housed within the box) provide the cook refrigerant for direct cooling the air.\n<br>\n<br><b>Working of unit air conditioners\n</b><br>We recall that a vapour compression refrigeration system needs a \n<br>(a) compressor to pressurize and heat the refrigerant\n<br>(b) a condenser to cool the hot refrigerant gas \n<br>(c) an expansion valve (a constriction in the pipeline carrying the refrigerant, which lowers the pressure and also the temperature of the refrigerant to a very cool state)\n<br>(d) an evaporator coil through which the cool refrigerant passes and surrounding which hot room air circulates to get cool\n<br>(e) appropriate refrigerant\n<br>(f) pipeline for circulating the refrigerant through all the devices as mentioned. \n<br>\n<br>The air-conditioning section consists of a blower (a fan which can develop higher pressure), which sucks in return air from the room through inlet louvers/ grilles over the cool evaporator coil and forces it over the same coil finally back to the room again through delivery louvers/grilles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

If we recollect the refrigeration system, we will notice that the first four components comprise a basic refrigeration system. The cold refrigerant passes through the chilling coil over which flows the warm air from outside (in case fresh air is admitted) and the relatively cooler return air from inside the room forced over the chilling coil by a fan. Another fan forces ; atmospheric air to cool the hot refrigerant from the compressor flowing through the hot or condenser coil. These two fans are driven by a single drive motor.<br><br><br><b>Split-system units\n</b><br>The development of split air-conditioning units has further made the installation of room air conditioners more flexible. In this system, the cold Side of the unit (such as expansion valve, chilling coil, etc.) is physically separated from the hot side (such as hot coil or condenser coil). The refrigerant flows through a long pipeline connecting the hot side and the cold side. The cold side is placed inside the room and the hot side outside the building where there is no problem of condensation of water (during passage of atmospheric air over hot coil, moisture condenses out), which had been a problem in the old single-unit compact version for rooms having all walls inside the building. The unit consists of a long, spiral coil shaped like a cylinder. Inside the coil is a fan, to blow air through the coil, along with a weather-resistant compressor and some control logic. <br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It takes up heat from inside the refrigerator cabinet and releases it to the outside atmosphere.\n<br><b>• SENSIBLE HEAT – </b>The heat which is used to raise or lower the temperature of a substance.\n<br><b>• LATENT HEAT –</b> Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released when a substance changes its physical state. Latent heat is absorbed upon evaporation, and released upon condensation to liquid (as in clouds).\n<br><b>• EVAPORATION –</b> It is the process of a substance in a liquid state changing to a gaseous state due to an increase in temperature and/or pressure.\n<br><b>• CONDENSATION -</b> It is the change of the physical state of matter from gas phase into liquid phase, and is the reverse of evaporation.\n<br><b>• ONE TON OF REFRIGERATION –</b> It means cooling by extracting heat at the rate of 50Kcal/minute or 3000 Kcal/hr.\n<br>\n<br><b>Types of refrigerants&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

Evaporator\n<br>2. Compressor\n<br>3. Condenser\n<br>4. Expansion Valve\n<br>\n<br><b>EVAPORATOR:</b> In the evaporator the Refrigerant absorbs the heat from the object to be cooled and itself gets heated up. The heat absorbed is the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid refrigerant and therefore the refrigerant undergoes a change of state i.e. from liquid to vapours without any change in temperature. The vapour refrigerant then returns to the compressor.\n<br>\n<br><b>COMPRESSOR:</b> The vapour refrigerant is compressed at a very high pressure and temperature. It then passes through the condenser coil.\n<br>\n<br><b>CONDENSER:</b> While passing through the condenser the refrigerant rejects heat either to air or to surrounding water which gets heated up. The refrigerant condenses to a cold liquid state but at high pressure. This high pressure colder refrigerant then passes through the expansion valve.\n<br>\n<br><b>EXPANSION VALVE:</b> The expansion valve cools down the refrigerant to a low temperature and also reduces the pressure. It can be adjusted to control the temperature and pressure to which the refrigerant goes to the evaporator. The cool refrigerant is now ready to absorb heat from the hot objects while passing through the evaporator.\n<br>* Efficiency of Refrigeration System is expressed as Coefficient of Performance (COP) and is\ndefined as the ratio of refrigeration effect produced to the mechanical work done.\n<br>\n<b><br>TYPES OF REFRIGERATING UNITS IN HOTEL INDUSTRY\n</b><br>The usual categories of refrigerating units employed in the hotel industry are:\n<br>• Reach – in Units\n<br>• Counter – top or table – top Units\n<br>• Walk – in Units\n<br>• Special – purpose Units\n<br>\n<br>Each of the above mentioned units can have both cooler and freezer sections in them. Some refrigerators are now divided into four zones to store different types of food. They are as follows:\n<br>• Subzero (up to - 18 degree Celsius) - Freezer Section\n<br>• 0 degree Celsius - Meat preservation Section\n<br>• 5 degree Celsius - Refrigerator\n<br>• 10 degree Celsius - Vegetables Section\n<br>\n<br><b>Reach – in refrigerators\n</b><br>Coolers &amp; Freezers – Capacities of such units are usually expressed in terms of the internal space volume (cubic metre) or in mass (Kg) of material being stored in it. Typical interior temperature range for cooler should be 4.4 degree Celsius to 7 degree Celsius and for a freezer should be -15 degree Celsius to -23 degree Celsius.\n<br>\n<br><b>Counter top units\n</b><br>Small counter top refrigerators are frequently used to facilitate service. They are usually coolers and have features similar to those of reach-in coolers but of much smaller size usually up to a size of 100 litres only.\n<br>\n<br><b>Walk – in refrigeration system\n</b><br>As the name suggests, food operators can directly move into such units. They are much bigger in size and height than walk – in refrigerators. A typical size would be 4 X 5 X 3 m, or even more, or as less as having a floor area of 2 sq.m. They are normally custom built\n<br>\n<b><br>Special purpose units\n</b><br>•&nbsp;<b><i>Ice Cream Conservator and frozen food conservator: </i></b>They are usually “well type” and open vertically through a lid. This minimizes heat loss as cool and heavy air inside cannot escape upward. They are usually maintained at temperatures between -23 to -18 degree Celsius.\n<br>•&nbsp;<b><i>Wet Fish Cabinets:</i></b> They contain deep galvanized drawers in which fish can be embedded in ice. They keep moist storage conditions necessary for maintaining the quality of fish. They are usually maintained at temperatures between 0 to -2 degree Celsius.\n<br>•&nbsp;<b><i>Display Cabinets:</i></b> In many hotels, there is a refrigerated display cabinet kept in the dinning for the customers to choose varieties of meats for grilling. They are also used to display bakery products and desserts.\n<br>•&nbsp;<b><i>Bottle Coolers:</i></b> They are used in dining and are usually in bars. They are constructed in two ways. One is open refrigerated through type and the other is glass front cabinet type with hinged doors or sliding doors.\n<br>•&nbsp;<b>Ice makers:</b> Modern ice making machines need only to be connected to a cold water supply line. Water flows over a refrigerated plate and gets converted into a slab of ice. This slab of ice passes over a wire net which is electrically heated and the slab melts along the wire mesh and falls through the square holes as separate small cubes of ice.\n<br>\n<br><b>CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF REFRIGERATING UNITS\n</b><br>Regular cleaning and maintenance not only makes your equipment work more efficiently, but it also helps it last longer. When parts are worn and dirty, the unit runs more frequently causing more wear and tear on the parts. Eventually, the unit breaks down for good long before it should have. Preventing these issues is simpler than you think. Call in a qualified refrigeration service company at least twice a year and up to once a month, depending on the load and usage of your equipment, to do the following tasks:\n<br>\n<br><b>• </b>Clean evaporator and condenser coils\n<br>• Check lines for condensation\n<br>• Clean fan blades and inspect the fan motor\n<br>• Check integrity of insulation\n<br>• Check for air leaks through cracks, holes, and worn parts like gaskets and seals\n<br>• Lubricate door hinges and handles\n<br>• Check for loose electrical connections\n<br>• Clear drain lines of debris\n<br>• Check temperature and defrost settings and calibrate thermometers\n<br>• Check filters on ice makers\n<br>• Thoroughly clean all ice maker components\n<br>\n<br><b>Difference Between Air Conditioning and Refrigeration\n</b><br>In refrigeration, the apparatus supplies thermal energy from one place to a place of higher temperature whereas in air conditioning, the thermal energy is taken from the air in order to cool the air. Naturally, thermal energy can be seen flowing from higher temperature bearing place to lower temperature bearing place.\n<br>The use of heat pump and refrigerator applications can be seen in all these types of appliances. An AC has an indoor and outdoor unit connected with a pipe, the air is heated, compressed, condensed and then liquified, then the liquid gas evaporates and then cooled with the help of condenser to give the cooled air which we experience.\n<br><b><br></b><br><b>Air Conditioning \n</b><br>• Thermal energy is taken away from the place to keep the air cooler\n<br>• It is a type of refrigeration used to cool large area\n<br>• It deals with maintaining the temperature of a certain volume of air and also maintaining the purity and humidity\n<br>• The compressor and condenser are a separate unit from the evaporator\n<br>• The mechanism is supplied with gas from the tubes\n<br>• Cold air is pushed away from the unit\n<br>\n<b><br>Refrigeration\n</b><br>• Thermal energy is transferred from one place to a place of higher temperature\n<br>• Helps to flow thermal energy against the natural flow of heat\n<br>• It deals only with regulating the temperature of air such as cooling and freezing of products\n<br>• The appliance has a condenser, compressor, and evaporator in one set unit\n<br>• Internal chemicals and even air are supplied from the environment\n<br>• Cold air is kept inside the unit\n<br></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",
