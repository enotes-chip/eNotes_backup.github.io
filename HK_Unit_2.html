</strong><br>Cleaning is the removal of dust, dirt, foreign matter, tarnish, stains from various surfaces with the aid of certain cleaning agents. And equipment. Dust, dirt and foreign matter deposited on a surface are referred to as soil. This may include substances such as sand, mud, pollutants, smoke and fumes brought into the building from outside. Some types of soil, such as sewage, hair, dead skin cells and fibers shed from the clothing are generated by the occupants of a building.
<br>Cleaning is carried out for the following reasons:
<br>
<br><strong>Aesthetic Appeal: </strong>the environment is made visually attractive and appealing
<br><strong>Hygiene: </strong>effective, frequent cleaning controls the growth and reproduction of pathogenic bacteria and other germs
<br><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Surfaces and articles, however good in quality, will have a long, functional life only when they are cleaned on a regular basis.
<br><strong>Safety:</strong> Cleaning is done for safety against health hazards, and slip hazards.
<br>
<br><strong>Types of soils
</strong><br>soil is the collective term for deposits of dust, dirt, foreign matter, tarnish and stains.
<br>●<em> Dust:</em> this is composed of loose particles deposited from the air. It contains both organic (human and animal hair, dead skin cells, particles of excreta, pollen from plants and so on) and inorganic (sand, dry earth) matter. Although dust is light, it is heavier that air thus settles readily on any surface.
<br>●<em> Dirt:</em> this implies dust held together firmly by moisture or grease on rough surfaces.
<br>●<em> Tarnish:</em> this is a discoloration or deposition on a metal or alloy surface caused by chemical reaction with certain substances found in air, water and foodstuffs. Each metal gets a different type of tarnish when exposed for too long to these substances. For instance, iron gets a reddish-brown rust, copper gets a greenish deposit of verdigris, and silver gets blackened. There are different methods for the removal of tarnish from different metals.
<br>● Stain: this is a discoloration caused on a hard or soft surface by a substance containing dyes, proteins, acids, or alkalis. Stains are difficult to remove by routine cleaning processes. Any stain must be removed as soon as possible by using powders to absorb it, solvents to dissolve it , or an acidic or alkaline cleaner to neutralize it
<br>● <em>Foreign Matters:</em> These may be dead flowers, contents of wastepaper baskets and ashtrays, as well as stains from the deposition of foreign substances.
<br>
<br><strong>Housekeeping Basic Principles of Cleaning:
</strong><br>● All soils should be removed without harming the surface being cleaned or the surrounding surfaces.
<br>● The surface should be restored to its original state after the cleaning processes.
<br>● The cleaning process should be efficient, using a minimum of equipment, cleaning agents, labor &amp; time.
<br>● The simplest cleaning method should be tried first, along with using the mildest cleaning agent.
<br>● Always use the cleaning methods least harmful to the surface.
<br>● The cleaning should proceed from high area to low wherever possible.
<br>● Always start with the cleaner surfaces &amp; then go on to clean the more heavily soiled ones, so as to prevent the spread of soil from dirty to cleaner surfaces.
<br>● While wet cleaning an area or polishing the floor, the cleaner should walk backward while cleaning in front of him.
<br>● Use of the suction/vacuum cleaning should be preferred over sweeping wherever possible.
<br>● Sweeping should be done before dusting, and dusting before suction cleaning.
<br>● The noise levels while cleaning should be kept as low as possible.
<br>● Try to remove stains as soon as they occur using the correct methods.
<br>● The cleaner should take all safety precautions while cleaning.
<br>● The cleaning agents &amp; equipment should be stacked neatly to one side after each use.
<br>● The cleaner should start cleaning from the farthest end of an area, working towards the exit.
<br>● After the cleaning process is over, all equipment should be washed or wiped as applicable, dried, &amp; stored properly.
<br>● Cleaning agents should be replenished &amp; stored properly.
<br>● All waste needs to be discarded &amp; the working area should be always left neat &amp; tidy.
<br>
<br><strong>Hygiene and Safety Factors in cleaning
</strong><br><strong><em><br></em></strong><br><strong><em>Hygiene Factors
</em></strong><br>● Grooming &amp; Personal Hygiene to be maintained
<br>● Equipment hygiene to be maintained – all types of equipment to be washed, rinsed &amp; dried after use
<br>● Workplace hygiene – pantry to be kept clean at all times
<br>● Colour coded dusters to be used
<br>● WC duster to be kept separately in the chamber maid’s trolley
<br>● Cleaning solution to be changed frequently while cleaning
<br>● Use of wringer
<br>● Brooms should not be used especially in hospitals
<br>● Cleaning agents to be prepared freshly. Never top up a disinfectant solution. Bacteria will survive a disinfectant, may multiply in solution which has deteriorated. If a solution is stored and used later, it may spread germs rather than kill them
<br>● Use of sanibins in public area toilets
<br>● Garbage not be touched a bare hand
<br>● Telephones need to disinfected
<br>
<br><strong><em>Safety Factors
</em></strong><br>● Use of protective gears
<br>● Ladder to be checked off its stability &amp; durability before using
<br>● Caution board to be used in public areas
<br>● Appropriate types of equipment to be used while cleaning
<br>● While lifting heavy items, weight should not fall on the backbone ( bend from the knees and not back)
<br>● Avoid lifting the heavyweight; help should be taken wherever possible
<br>● Cleaning agents to be stored in the labeled bottles; instructions should be written on the bottles
<br>● Proper training to given to cleaners in terms of use of equipment &amp; cleaning agents
<br>● First aid kit to be maintained and kept available
<br>● Fire exit should never be blocked by keeping equipment/ furniture in front of it
<br>● At the time of the fire, elevators should not be used
<br>● Ensure that the cigarette butts are fully extinguished before they are trashed
<br>● Dispose off rags after using any solvent as they can increase the risk of fire&nbsp;<br></p>
