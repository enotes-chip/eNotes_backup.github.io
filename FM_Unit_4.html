                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">HOTEL AND RESORT DESIGN is an integrative process that brings together the skills and expertise of owners, managers, architects, builders, and a host of others to conceive and construct a building to meet a variety of business and travel objectives. Owners see the hotel as a real estate and investment opportunity; managers expect the project to meet certain strategic goals and provide revenue; future guests need accommodations for business or personal travel, and others have myriad reasons for involvement in the development and design process.
<br>
<br><strong>The Feasibility Study
</strong><br>Among the first steps that the developer takes is to study the feasibility of the proposed hotel. The feasibility study is usually prepared by a consulting firm and reviewed by the hotel management company. Its purpose is twofold: first, it Assesses present and future demand for lodging and such hotel services like meeting rooms, restaurants and lounges, and recreational facilities. Secondly, it estimates the proposed hotel’s operating income and expenses for five to ten years after the
<br>hotel opens.
<br>A hotel’s owner has many reasons for undertaking a feasibility study. Most will use the study to help obtain permanent financing; others may use it to gain a franchise or management agreement, attract equity partners, or support a request for a zoning change. Interestingly, only infrequently do these studies actually assess a project’s feasibility, which may largely depend on the owner’s investment
<br>strategies and tax status. Instead, a feasibility study provides a description of the local area and potential markets, recommends proposed facilities, and projects cash flow. The typical report usually covers the following components:
<br>
<br><strong>● Local area evaluation:</strong> Analyzes the economic vitality of the city or region and describes the suitability of the project site for a hotel.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Lodging market analysis:</strong> Assesses the present demand for lodging and other revenue generators and future growth rates for each of several market segments, and identifies the existing supply of competitive properties and their probable growth.
<br>● Proposed facilities: Proposes a balance of guestroom and revenue-generating public facilities (restaurants and lounges, function rooms, retail stores, recreational facilities) and assesses the competitive position of the property.
<br>● Financial analysis: Estimates income and expenses for the hotel over a five- or ten-year period to show its potential cash flow after fixed charges (before debt service and income tax).
<br>
<br><strong>HOTEL PLANNING</strong>
<br>The architectural team needs to investigate the site before it can begin to develop the building’s form and organization. The following list identifies some of the things the architect must do:
<br>
<br>● Visibility and accessibility: Consider surrounding street patterns, road access.
<br>● Surface conditions: Analyze terrain, vegetation, utilities, existing buildings and roads, environmental constraints.
<br>● Subsurface conditions: Investigate water table, bearing capacity of the soil, underground utilities, environmental hazards.
<br>● Regulatory restrictions: Research applicable zoning, parking, building, and other codes.
<br>● Site character: Study surface conditions (above), adjoining uses, views.
<br>● Orientation and climate: Position building and recreational facilities for sun; analyze micro climate (for resorts).
<br>● Adaptability: Determine the site’s potential for expansion or development for other uses
<br>
<br><strong>Following points to be considered while plan &amp; design the hotels
</strong><br>Hotel interior designers need to consider which areas should be separated and which can effectively be combined.
<br>
<br><strong>1. GUEST ROOMS:
</strong><br>Guestroom into separate areas, accommodating such overlapping functions as sleeping, working, lounging, dressing, and hygiene. In addition, the interior designer must select individual furnishings that meet a number of basic design criteria:
<br>
<br>● Beds: Determine the exact room mix for the hotel; provide adequate spacing; include bedside tables and adequate lighting; consider TV viewing angle.
<br>● Work area: Provide a desk or worktable, consider chair height and comfort, and provide a phone and adequate lighting.
<br>● Lounge area: Provide a soft seating group; consider comfort, lighting, table(s), TV viewing angle, and adequate space for foldout sofa; assess need for mini-bar.
<br>● Clothes storage/dressing area: Determine requirements for drawer space, the size of the closet, and luggage storage needs; provide full-length mirrors.
<br>● Bathroom: Select bathroom fixtures and accessories; consider lighting, counter space, ventilation, and finishes.
<br>● Decor: Evaluate furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&amp;E)—carpet, wall covering, sheer and blackout drapes, bedspreads, and so forth.
<br>● Other: Screen view into guest room from the corridor; provide a separate dressing area; assess the need for balcony, adjoining rooms, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>2. LOBBY
</strong><br>The development team must establish criteria for the planning and design of the lobby, based on the hotel’s concept and the guest markets it will attract. These criteria might include the following:
<br>
<br>● Circulation: Provide clear paths to front desk, elevators, food and beverage (F&amp;B) outlets, function space, etc.
<br>● Front desk: Make the front desk visible to entering guests. It should overlook the elevators, have sufficient space for check-in‘ check-out lines, and have direct access to the front office.
<br>● Luggage: Provide areas for bell persons, luggage storage, and other locked storage.
<br>● Seating: Provide seating near the front desk and entrance, with more private seating nearby, and determine the need for a lobby lounge.
<br>● Support functions: Conveniently locate retail outlets, the concierge desk, public restrooms, house and pay phones, coatrooms, the hotel directory, etc.
<br>● Décor: Establish the hotel’s image with millwork, furnishings, artwork, lighting, signage, and so forth that are appropriate to the locale.
<br>
<br><strong>3. FOOD AND BEVERAGE OUTLETS
</strong><br><strong><em>A) Restaurants
</em></strong><br>Restaurants and lounges, because they face such severe outside competition, create the greatest operational and design challenges, Whatever the concept, the food and beverage designer must attempt to meet many generally accepted design criteria:
<br>
<br>● Location: Position the main three-meal restaurant convenient to the lobby. Consider locating the specialty restaurant with direct exterior access.
<br>● Service: Group all food outlets close to the kitchen or a satellite pantry, and provide bars with nearby storage and support areas.
<br>● Flexibility: Design large restaurants and bars so that sections can be closed during slow periods.
<br>● Support areas: Place public restrooms, coatrooms, and telephones nearby.
<br>● Layout: Provide a desk for the host, service stations, and a flexible mix of table sizes. Minimize or eliminate floor-level changes to better accommodate disabled guests.
<br>
<br><strong><em>B) Function Space
</em></strong><br>● Location: Group all function areas in a location easily accessible from the lobby; in major convention hotels consider creating two or more separate function zones.
<br>● Flexibility: Include moveable partitions in larger rooms, determine the need for multi-purpose versus dedicated rooms, and create multiple pre-function areas.
<br>● Access: Provide a separate entrance to the function area from the street or parking lot, provide public and service access to each function room, and consider the access needs for moving display materials into the ballroom and exhibit areas.
<br>● Support areas: Include sufficient restrooms, coatrooms, and telephones for the public and provide banquet pantry, furniture, and audiovisual storage in the back-of-the-house.
<br>● Structure: Provide column-free function spaces and locate the ballroom and larger meeting rooms independent of the guest room tower to simplify the hotel's structure.
<br>● Ceiling height: Determine the need for projection booths in the larger function rooms and consider how the high ceilings in these rooms will affect the floor above.
<br>● Windows: Determine the need for natural light in function and assembly areas.
<br>
<br><strong><em>C) Recreational Facilities:
</em></strong><br>● Floors: Select a carpet pattern to aid in room setup; use a portable dance floor.
<br>● Walls: Apply a chair rail to walls to protect their finish; add fabric panels to improve acoustics and upgrade room appearance.
<br>● Ceiling: Organize HVAC, lighting, sound system, fire protection, and other systems into a unified design.
<br>● Windows: Add full blackout capability.
<br>● Furniture: Select risers, lecterns, stacking chairs, and a balance of rectangular classroom tables and round or oval banquet tables; select high-quality chairs for upgraded conference rooms.
<br>● Lighting: Provide a fully dimmable system including, as appropriate, chandeliers, down lights, track lights, fluorescent lighting, and decorative wall fixtures.
<br>● HVAC/systems: Provide separate mechanical, electrical, and sound systems for each room division.
<br>● Communications: Include TV, telephone, recording, and data lines in each function and control room.
