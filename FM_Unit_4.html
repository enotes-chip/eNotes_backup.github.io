Owners see the hotel as a real estate and investment opportunity; managers expect the project to meet certain strategic goals and provide revenue; future guests need accommodations for business or personal travel, and others have myriad reasons for involvement in the development and design process.
<br>
<br><strong>The Feasibility Study
</strong><br>Among the first steps that the developer takes is to study the feasibility of the proposed hotel. The feasibility study is usually prepared by a consulting firm and reviewed by the hotel management company. Its purpose is twofold: first, it Assesses present and future demand for lodging and such hotel services like meeting rooms, restaurants and lounges, and recreational facilities. Secondly, it estimates the proposed hotel’s operating income and expenses for five to ten years after the
<br>hotel opens.
<br>A hotel’s owner has many reasons for undertaking a feasibility study. Most will use the study to help obtain permanent financing; others may use it to gain a franchise or management agreement, attract equity partners, or support a request for a zoning change. Interestingly, only infrequently do these studies actually assess a project’s feasibility, which may largely depend on the owner’s investment
<br>strategies and tax status. Instead, a feasibility study provides a description of the local area and potential markets, recommends proposed facilities, and projects cash flow. The typical report usually covers the following components:
<br>
<br>● <em>Local area evaluation:</em> Analyzes the economic vitality of the city or region and describes the suitability of the project site for a hotel.
<br>● <em>Lodging market analysis:</em> Assesses the present demand for lodging and other revenue generators and future growth rates for each of several market segments, and identifies the existing supply of competitive properties and their probable growth.
<br>● <em>Proposed facilities:</em> Proposes a balance of guestroom and revenue-generating public facilities (restaurants and lounges, function rooms, retail stores, recreational facilities) and assesses the competitive position of the property.
<br>● <em>Financial analysis:</em> Estimates income and expenses for the hotel over a five- or ten-year period to show its potential cash flow after fixed charges (before debt service and income tax).
<br>
<br><strong>HOTEL PLANNING
</strong><br>The architectural team needs to investigate the site before it can begin to develop the building’s form and organization. The following list identifies some of the things the architect must do:
<br>
<br>● Visibility and accessibility: Consider surrounding street patterns, road access.
<br>● Surface conditions: Analyze terrain, vegetation, utilities, existing buildings and roads, environmental constraints.
<br>● Subsurface conditions: Investigate water table, bearing capacity of the soil, underground utilities, environmental hazards.
<br>● Regulatory restrictions: Research applicable zoning, parking, building, and other codes.
<br>● Site character: Study surface conditions (above), adjoining uses, views.
<br>● Orientation and climate: Position building and recreational facilities for sun; analyze micro climate (for resorts).
<br>● Adaptability: Determine the site’s potential for expansion or development for other uses.
<br>
<br><strong>What is BluePrint in Constructions
</strong><br>Construction blueprints (also known as construction plans or construction drawings) are two-dimensional drawings that contain all the details that are needed for a project. Blueprints are far more detailed and technical plans for your remodel or other construction project. These details are needed to request permits, determine the construction schedule, and eventually do the construction itself. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction and industry.
<br>
<br><strong>Why are blueprints important?
</strong><br>● Drawings thereby allow you to measure your compliance against the specifications.
<br>● They allow you to guide needed installations by referencing as-built drawing sets and enable you to track any kind of modification or addition with what you are installing.
<br>● Blueprints and drawings are also great resources for maintenance and troubleshooting.<strong><br></strong><br><br><strong>HOTEL RENOVATION
</strong><br>Hotel renovation is a process of updating hotel property to meet the changing needs of the market and improving outdated, broken, or damaged premises. A renovation is a conversion of an old structure into a new one within the framework. It typically matches the modern needs and requirements. Complete evacuation of the renovation area is necessary, although floor-by-floor or room-by room renovation is sometimes possible in case of minor renovation. Additionally, renovation brings something back to life and gives a new look.Under hotel renovation, the tangible products are changed, modified, updated or improved.
<br>
<br><strong>Reason to Renovate
</strong><br>● <strong>To fix a safety issue -&nbsp;</strong>In hotel renovation some safety issues like electric problems, leakages, cracks in walls are handled that must be taken care of for safety and to prevent any catastrophic event.
<br>● <strong>To upgrade the functionality of the property -</strong> Renovation enhances the functioning of the hotel operations. Moreover, it should not decrease the usable space or lower the value of the establishment.
<br>● <strong>To increase the comfort or and leisure of the hotel -</strong> Renovation increases the comfort and leisure of the establishment. Although, the renovation should not be done solely for enhancing the aesthetic appeal or else it will end up being just a showplace, lacking the feeling of peace and relaxation.
<br>● <strong>To improve the value of the establishment - </strong>Renovation improves the value of the establishment. It is often carried out to have the best returns of the value at the time of sale.
<br>● <strong>To increase the efficiency of the establishment - </strong>Improvements in the structure such as new appliances and added insulation decrease the energy usage, thereby reducing the costs. It is observed that such energy efficient structures are an attraction to buyers due to their cost saving ability.
<br>● <strong>To update the style of the establishment - </strong>Older structures look out dated and often less attractive. Although, renovation may take place as per the new trends of the market but the timeless styles add to the sophistication of the establishment and can command a premium price from the clientele.
<br>● <strong>To prepare the building for sale -</strong> Renovation may even take place before the sale of the establishment. Generally, neutral colours, upgrades that add value and fixing any cosmetic or functional problems help the structure to get in better shape for sale.
<br>
<br><strong>Identifying The Need For Renovation
</strong><br>Hotels comprises a large number of depreciable elements that wear out or fade with regular use and become outdated and old fashioned which require maintenance or updation to match current market trends and to maintain brands reputation. The following points help in identifying the need for renovation.
<br>
<br>1. Cracks, holes or chips in tiles, walls, or floors which will become more severe if not
<br>attended in time.
<br>2. Dirty, faded, stained or worn out carpet looks shabby.
<br>3. The creakiness and showing rust on doors and windows. The sound while operating doors and windows also give an idea, if they require maintenance or not.
<br>4. Lighting system is not working properly and it feels dark in the room.
<br>5. Scratched, broken or damaged furniture and fixtures.
<br>6. Water is not running constantly through taps or there are other plumbing problems.
<br>7.Creaky, rusty and loose flooring.
<br>8. Mould signs in the washrooms, toilets or in other such areas.
<br>9. Worn out, dirty or stained furnishing.
<br>10. High level of humidity and moisture in the rooms
<br><br>
<br><strong>Types of Renovation
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Special Projects –</strong> The scope of a special project is to perform work related to a specific system upgrade that can be handled without changing the hotel’s interior design in any substantial way. As such, special projects have typically been related to technology or engineering systems. Examples include: installation of electronic locking systems, installation of equipment for high-speed Internet access, and fire sprinkler system retrofits.<br><br><strong>Minor renovations(6-Year Cycle)</strong> – The minor renovation deals with the renovation or replacement of less durable furnishing and finishes without changing the physical layout. In minor renovation, you’re repairing, repainting and replacement of carpet, furniture, wall covering, drapery and other minor fixing required attention. 
<br>
<br><strong>Major renovations (12 to 15 - Year Cycle)</strong> – The major renovation deals with the renovation and replacement of all furnishing and finishes and it may include change in the physical layout. Major renovation is a big step in which a hotel may be going through floors, walls, ceilings or other places that a hotel wouldn’t usually get the chance to be in.A major renovation may include all minor renovations plus the replacement of lighting, fittings, bedding, furniture and other accessories. <br>Hotel will make some big changes which may be partitioning a room or removing walls for increasing the area. The major renovation is usually done to increase or decrease the area of the kitchen or bathroom. Floor or roof and exterior enclosure elements such as walls, windows and doors also are frequently part of a renovation. A hotel may add a new kitchen, guestroom, restaurant, banquet by moving some walls, but adding any extra rooms or space separately is not a part of major renovation. 
<br>
<br><strong>Restoration (25 to 45 - Year Cycle)</strong> - In a restoration or total renovation, major elements such as entire corridors, lobby, elevators, stairs, lavatories, complete floor, electrical systems as well as emergency exits revamping, even locations or rooms are added, reconfigured, or relocated for efficient operations and other marketability reasons or to meet the new structural designs.
<br>
<br><strong>
The Planning Phase
</strong><br>
<br>The planning phase for property renovation consists of several steps:
<br>
<br>● Conduct strategic review
<br>● Survey the property and create a preliminary project list
<br>● Estimate project costs and benefits
<br>
<br><strong>Conduct a Strategic Review:</strong> The annual renovation process should begin with an understanding of the hotel’s long-term needs, ideally arrived at through a facility life-cycle cost study. However, this plan is normally based on the typical life of building components, without regard to current competitive pressures. Therefore, in addition to this long-term plan, management must have a strategy to contend with the property's immediate competitive environment.
<br>
<br>Owners and managers need to take a step-by-step approach to the assessment of the property's current and desired operational mission; there should be a rigorous periodic evaluation of the property, a strategic review. In most organizations, this step is usually handled as a joint effort between management and ownership, typically conducted by the property’s general manager and the owner’s representative or asset manager. In large hotel chains, regional or divisional managers are
<br>also involved.
<br>
<br><strong>Survey the Property and Create a Preliminary Project List:</strong> The need to properly survey the property cannot be overemphasized. A thorough survey of the property helps management determine what areas and facilities need to be renovated. A proper survey includes input from all department heads. The survey is meant to identify needs and stimulate ideas. Another reason to survey is to force managers responsible for the renovation to inspect the spaces to be renovated. In many cases, two surveys are appropriate. The first survey is typically performed by the hotel's management to identify needs. Once renovation projects have been determined, a follow-up survey is done by the manager in charge of the renovation along with the designer(s) and/or engineer(s) to determine the exact scope of the renovation work. 
<br>
<br><strong>Estimating benefits:</strong> There are two types of benefit analysis: one for projects directly affecting revenues, and the other for projects that support revenues. An example of a project directly affecting revenues is the renovation of a lounge; an example of a project that supports revenues would be replacing the roof. The key to analyzing projects directly affecting revenues is to compare the net benefits (i.e, increase in revenues due to renovation) with the renovation costs, using the appropriate present value techniques for revenues that are projected to occur in the future.<br><br><br><strong>RENOVATION PROCESS
</strong><br>This process involves renovating a hotel property so as to give it a new and fresh look. This may include repairing and replacing furniture, finishes, soft furnishing and fittings that have become obsolete or need attention. This process is usually carried out every 4-6 years, depending on the wear and tear of building and budget of the hotel. The following steps are carried out in the refurbishing process.
<br>
<br><strong>1. Physical Evaluation:</strong> Physical inspection of the hotel structure is necessary to determine whether refurbishing is required or not. Physical inspection is usually carried out by an executive housekeeper who checks every guestroom and areas in the building for refurbishing. After inspection, a detailed report is prepared which specifies the areas required renovation and estimated budget is prepared.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Time Allocation:</strong> The expected time to complete the renovation process must be taken into account when preparing the reports and costs. The refurbishment process must be carried out in off season or during the period of low occupancy.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Budgeting:</strong> Budgeting is to prepare the estimation cost required for the decided project. The detailed report for money expenditure is prepared for different areas.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Theme and Design feasibility:</strong> In this stage a theme or design is decided for the specific area. Design may be same or different for different spaces.Once a theme or design is decided then a feasibility study is carried out to test the financial viability for the same.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Décor Preliminaries:</strong> Suitable decoration material such as fabrics, colours, finishes should be selected carefully. It should be durable, fire resistant, matching with theme and most importantly easy to clean and maintain.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Hiring Contractors:</strong> The refurbishment is carried out either by the hotel staff or by the contractors. A cost comparison must be done before deciding whether a tender should be invited or not. Usually this kind of work is handled by the contractors as it is expensive to hire new staff, prepare new uniforms, arrange training programmes and so on.
<br>
<br>7. Equipment and Raw Material inventory and Ware-Housing: Equipment and raw material required for the process must be purchased after market research. Sufficient supplies should be available in the store all time.
<br>
<br><strong>8. Pre Arrangements for guests, staff and suppliers:</strong> Pre arrangement for guests should be made in prior for avoiding any inconvenience and discomfort to the guests. Guests should be informed about the renovation work carried out in the premises.
<br>
<br><strong>9. Procedural Guidelines:</strong> Guidelines are the parameters set aside to determine a course of action. It may include planning, regulations, evaluations, policies and laws related to the project.
<br>
<br><strong>10. Control:</strong> Success of any project largely depends upon controlling. Controlling checks the mistakes and errors and also helps in facing challenges. It helps in testing, regulating, adjusting or verifying. Controlling is necessary at each level and in each department. 
<br>
<br><strong>SUBSIDIARY PROCESS IN RENOVATION</strong>
<br>There are four major sub-processes in renovation.
<br>
<br><strong>1. Refurbishing:</strong> It involves repairing and fixing some areas or items, decorating a guest room,and restoring the hotels’ appearance and condition.The refurbishment includes changing the furniture, curtains, fittings etc.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Redecoration: </strong>The process of applying paint, touching up of furniture and finishes, changing the wallpapers in rooms. It can also be used to change the style of rooms or other areas.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Restoration:</strong> The term ‘restoration’ is the act of returning the building structure to its former condition. This is usually applied for heritage hotels and some old infrastructure. It also includes repairing walls, replacing old furniture and fixtures, removing old wood floors and refinishing hard floors.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Remodeling:</strong> Remodeling is conversions of existing spaces and structure and the replacement of a defective area or item in the hotel and the addition of space and extensions.In this, a hotel focus on improving a structure that is defective, outdated, broken or damaged.&nbsp;<br></p>
