<br>It is best to develop one's own colour sense by studying and by observing books, museums and art galleries. Since that is a long process, the following information on the use of colour schemes is a definite help. <br>
<br><strong>1.Monochromatic Colour Scheme</strong> -.only one colour is used in varied values and intensity. This scheme may be monotonous for bedrooms. Many values of one hue like red, brown, dusty pink, slate blue and lime are attractive.
<br>
<br><strong>2.Analogous -</strong> is made by combining colours that are harmonious because they contain a proportion of the same colour. They are likely to be too cold or too warm, therefore, care should be taken to include at least one primary colour.
<br>
<br><strong>3.Triad - </strong>combines three equidistance colours, which occur at the points of an equilateral triangle, placed anywhere on the colour circle. This scheme is well balanced but the colour must be subdued to attain harmony.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Complementary -</strong> colours are opposite in the colour circle. It is a stimulating and balanced plan. The colour must be subdued and one should dominate.
<br>
<br><strong>5. Split Complimentary -</strong> one colour is used with the two colours that adjoin its complement on a colour circle. This plan provides some subtle combinations when the colours employed are properly subdued.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Tetrad Colour Scheme -</strong> In this scheme, FOUR colours are used. The colours chosen should be at an equal distance on the colour wheel. One of the colours should be in a stronger, brighter tone than the others.
<br>
<br><strong>7. Dominating Colour-</strong> in any type of colour scheme for any purpose, one colour should dominate in quantity; usually, another colour should be secondary in quantity. If a third colour is used, it should be least in quantity. The smaller the area, more brighter are the colours.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Factors that influence colour schemes: 
</strong><br>1. The room, size, shape, exposure (sun direction)
<br>2. Mood
<br>3. Style
<br>4. Current position
<br>5. Use of the room.
<br>
<br><strong>General suggestions for mixing colour scheme: 
</strong><br>Definite colour schemes such as complementary, analogous or triad are recommended. 
<br>
<br>1. A safe colour scheme consists of tint and shade of one colour (monochromatic) recommended for areas not to be used for too long, i.e. dining room, lobby, foyer etc.
<br>2. An easy scheme consists of white or off-white plus one or two clear colours 
<br>3. Three colours for (small areas) and four (for larger areas) 
<br>4. A scheme should be definitely dark or light 
<br>5. Either warm or cool colour should predominate
<br>6. A neutralized colour is generally best for large areas 
<br>7. A more definite colour scheme is suited for medium areas 
<br>8. One or two brighter colours sometimes complement the dominant colour 
<br>9. If a scheme lacks sparkle a brilliant contrasting colour or white may be added 
<br>10. Equal areas of different colours or monotonous 
<br>11. Every colour scheme should have dominating colour and a secondary colour
<br>
<br><strong>Procedure for making a colour scheme
</strong><br>1. Review the factors that influence colour schemes 
<br>2. Review the suggestions above 
<br>3. Consider the colour scheme of an adjoining room 
<br>4. Decide on the background colour 
<br>5. Procure samples of fabrics, wall colour )Paints), wood texture, wallpapers, etc, 
<br>6. Select colour scheme from fabric paints etc,
<br>7. Plan the values from those fabric paints etc,
<br>8. Plan the colour proportion (large, medium, or small areas) 
<br>9. Plan the variations in the intensity of the chosen few )bright or greyed)
<br>
<br><strong>Warm and cool colour 
</strong><br>Colours that contain yellow or red are considered to be warm, probably because we associate them with fire, sunshine and artificial light. Blues and greens suggest coolness because we associate it with skies, water, ice and foliage. In any colour in another scheme, either warm or cool colour should dominate 
<br>
<br><strong>Advancing or receding colour 
</strong><br>Warm Hue seems to advance while cool ones receding the most strongly advancing colour is yellow, then Orange, Red, Green, Violet, Blue in the interior.
<br>
<br><strong>Psychological Effect 
</strong><br>Colours have various effects on our daily life, mainly on our psychology. We read different colours in different ways like white shows cleanliness and purity. Blue and Green colours make u feel cool and calm and a feeling of rest comes in you. Yellow is considered to be the colour of the Sun and makes us feel warm and cheerful. Blue colour opens up our mind as Blue is the colour of the Sky which is open and widely spread. Red is a hot colour and can raise the temper of anybody's mind. Red also symbolizes welcome and affection. So we welcome our guests with red carpet, gift red rose to our beloved ones. Black is the symbol of evil or death. Black is also a depressing colour because it is linked with darkness. In this way, colours affect our mood in various ways and our mood is changed with the change of the colours' symbolic meaning. 
<br>
<strong><br>Emotional Effect 
</strong><br><strong>1. Yellow -</strong> has the effect of cheerfulness, gaiety, buoyancy, optimism, sympathy and prosperity. In-home decoration, yellow is indispensable because more than any other colour, it gives the effect of light. Accessories of yellow are usually needed in north rooms.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Orange -</strong> is warm in a pure state and therefore should be used in small quantities. It expresses energy, spirit, hope and cordiality. neutralized forms of orange are peach, rust, copper which radiate hospitality.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Brown -</strong> brown walls are now effectively used with natural wood furniture and light beige rugs or with one striking colour such as turquoise blue or cherry red. Chocolate, burnt cinnamon is more usable than other shades of yellow, brown.
<br>
<br>4. Red - is the colour of fire and blood. It is an expression of primitive passion,-war, vigour, power, movement, aggression, boldness and love. In decoration, red gives the impression of splendour, warmth, hospitality and exhilaration. It is cheerful but not restful and so must be used discreetly. Reds are usually greyed. In pure form, it should be used only in small proportions. Dark, dull, raspberry red has proved to be a successful colour for carpets. Pink is one of women's favourite colours and should be greyed if used in large quantities. 
<br>
<br><strong>5. Purple -</strong> is made of red and blue which possesses quite opposite charac­teristics and when mixed cancel each other's effects, so that purple is somewhat gentle and vague. It suggests mastery, dignity, reflection and twilight.
<br>
<br><strong>6. Blue -</strong> is the colour of clear sky and deep water and so is associated with coolness. It expresses distance, spaciousness, loftiness, dignity, calmness, serenity, reserve, formality, lack of sympathy and is an antidote to too much warmth. Blue is not so friendly with one another as other colours are both daylight and artificial light. Blue is a very important decorative colour as it is usable in large areas. Since blue is not neutralized as much as others.
<br>
<br><strong>7. Green -</strong> is the colour of grass, vegetables and leaves and it naturally suggests rest, cool, shade and refreshment, all pleasant things. Green is considered beneficial to the eyes, nerves and disposition. Predominates and cool if blue is dominant. Vigorous green combines well with knotty natural wood.
<br><br><strong>8. Neutral colours -</strong> are black, white and grey and also beige (natural wood colour). Such colours are most valuable for home furnishings, for large background areas are generally natural in colour. The true neutral colours are cool in effect.
<br>
<br><strong>9. Black -</strong> suggests mystery, wisdom, sophistication and in decoration can be employed to create a dramatic effect to a decorative scheme of dark colours; it adds spirit and interest. But in a light colour scheme, it adds too much interest and makes other colours appear faded. A small quantity of black is effective. Black furniture, particularly oriental pieces, are sometimes used to offset luxurious settings.
<br>
<strong><br>10. White -</strong> is a recurring favourite between periods of colourful decoration because of its serenity and coolness. White and off white are approved for exteriors and interiors. White is valuable for the opportunity it gives to display other colours. Pure white is best with cool colours, whereas cream and off white are usually more harmonious in warm schemes.
<br>
<br><strong>11. Grey - </strong>produced by mixing white and black has no particular character of its own, although in the light it seems gentle in the dark shade, dignified and restrained. Grey may be warm or cool. Grey should be accompanied by some brilliant colour to counteract its neutrality.
