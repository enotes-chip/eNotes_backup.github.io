</strong><br>
<br>After reading this topic, you will learn about:-
<br>1. Causes of Damp Wall
<br>2. Effects of Dampness in Wall
<br>3. Remedies.
<br>
<br><strong>Causes of Damp Wall:
</strong><br>There are various causes of ingress of moisture in walls which make them damp:
<br>i. Defective roof-leakage is a major source of water entering the wall and making it damp.
<br>ii. Porous bricks used in construction is a permanent source of dampness in walls as they attract  moisture. 
<br>iii. Bad materials used in construction are also a source of damp wall.
<br>iv. Vegetation – Growth of vegetation in the wall indicates presence of moisture or water without which it could not grow. Vegetation develops further cracks in a wall already having cracks and cause leakage in the wall. 
<br>v. Earth backing against wall – Dumping of earth against wall causes dampness in it.
<br>vi. Cavities, holes left in the wall due to negligence and dab-holes kept for erection of scaffolding and  later not filled properly with concrete are a prospective source of attracting and storing moisture. 
<br>vii. Mortar joints not laid properly and uniformly are sources of attracting moisture.
<br>viii. The worst source of moisture ingress in building wall is the defective damp proof course.  Decayed, dilapidated or defectively laid damp proof course, i.e., failure of the damp proof course to arrest rising of moisture from below causes dampness in wall. 
<br>ix. Earth banks – Construction of earthen bank by the side of a building, side slope covering some  height of the wall above damp proof course would cause dampness in wall. 
<br>x. Splashing of rain off the ground on the wall above the damp proof course which happens when the  plinth height is low or there be ground nearby with higher level. 
<br>xi. Defective window sills allowing stagnation of water on it.
<br>xii. Sloping ground – This generally happens in hill areas, where buildings are constructed on the  slopes of the hills. 
<br>xiii. Dampness in hollow walls is caused due to deposit of mortar droppings during construction and  lack of ventilation. 
<br>xiv. Leaking pipes – Soil, waste water, rain water, or water supply pipes allowing water to enter the  walls. 
<br>xv. Salt in the plaster – Presence of salt in the plaster or precisely in sand used for plaster will render  the wall damp. 
<br>
<br><strong>Effects of Dampness in Wall:
</strong><br>There are many injurious effects which are a direct result of dampness in walls of buildings:
<br>i. Unhygienic condition inside the building – inviting various diseases to the inmates.
<br>ii. Decay – The action of moisture on the different portions of the structure induce decay and  disintegration of materials like bricks, stone, steel, timber, etc. as continuous presence of moisture in the portions causes growth of moss, fungus and corrosion. 
<br>iii. Dry rot – The presence of moisture in timber causes the disease in the timber, termed dry rot. Dry rot is effective due to presence of a virulent type of fungus allied to mushroom type. 
<br>iv. Disintegration – Continued presence of moisture in brick may cause mechanical injury to the wall.  If there are cracks in the wall or porosity which may retain water in freezing temperature, the water will freeze, increase in volume and cause severe damage. 
<br>v. Efflorescence – It is produced by the entrance of moisture in the brickwork which usually contains  various soluble salts. These salts are dissolved by the water and issuing from the pores of the bricks, they crystallize and cause disintegration of bricks. 
<br>vi. Furniture – They are damaged due to continuous damp environment.
<br>vii. Decoration of timber, bamboo, wall papering, etc. get damaged.
<br>viii. Warping and decay of timber.
<br>ix. Plaster getting soft and subsequently crumbling.
<br>x. Corrosion of metal.
<br>xi. Damage to electrical installations and short circuiting.
<br>xii. Deterioration of floor covering.
<br>xiii. Infestation of termite.
<br>xiv. Blistering, flaking and bleaching of paint.
<br>
<br><strong>Remedies to Damp Wall:
</strong><br>Remedies to damp wall may be temporary or permanent according to the exigency. Again, treatment  to remove dampness would be different for internal and external walls. 
<br>
<br><strong>Temporary Remedies:
</strong><br>Temporary remedies for internal walls:
<br>
<br><strong><em>1. Application of bituminous painting:
</em></strong><br>The affected wall is to be cleaned, allowed to be dried and then a coat of hot bitumen applied  uniformly. However, if there be difficulty in applying hot bitumen, bituminous compound emulsions are available in the market which may be applied cold with brush. 
<br><strong><em>2. Painting with water proofing solution:
</em></strong><br>Either commercially available such solutions or prepared solution as described later may be applied as  prescribed after cleaning the surface. 
<br><strong><em>3. Applying cement wash:
</em></strong><br>This is an easy method. Cement and water mixed in thin consistency with admixture of adhesive gum  may be applied one or more coats after cleaning the surface. 
<br>
<br><strong>Temporary Remedies for External Walls:
</strong><br>1. Applying water proofing solutions as mentioned above.
<br>2. Coating with boiled linseed oil or commercially available linseed oil may be boiled and applied hot  with brush after cleaning the surface. 
<br>3. Applying cement wash as mentioned above.
<br>4. Sylvester’s Process – Applying alternate coats of soap and alum solutions to the walls where they  will sink into the pores just below the surface. The first coat to be applied after cleaning the surface. Subsequent coats to be applied after the previous coat have dried up. 
<br>5. Painting paraffin – Paraffin oil may be painted over the affected surface after cleaning.
<br>6. Applying bituminous paint as mentioned above. Application of bitumen or bituminous paint on  walls internal or external though may be effective, will render the wall surface look unpleasant. 
<br>
<br><strong>Permanent Remedies:
</strong><br>Before selecting a method for permanent remedy against dampness in walls, the cause of dampness, shall have to be investigated. Once the cause is established, the action to be taken for remedial measure would not be difficult. The  main object would be to remove the cause. In most of the cases, removal would not be difficult. As for example: 
<br>
<br>1. Dampness due to leakage from the roof – Stop the roof leakage.
<br>2. Vegetation – Removal of the vegetation including uprooting and applying chemical solution so that  growth may not recur and sealing if there be any crack. 
<br>3. Earth backing, bank, sloping ground, etc. – The space around the building need be dressed to avoid splashing of water on the wall. 
<br>4. Cavities, holes, etc. – Detect the exact spot, open the space and fill the cavity with concrete.
<br>5. Defective window sills – These are to be corrected.
<br>6. Dampness in hollow walls – The main purpose of constructing hollow walls is defeated. Utmost  care must be taken during construction to avoid dropping of mortar. The outer leaf of the wall which is a non-load bearing, may be opened partially for removing the dropped mortar and cleaning. Further, weep holes may be provided below horizontal damp proof course and air bricks may be  provided at suitable places for ventilation. 
<br>7. Salt in plaster – This is due to using bad quality sand during construction. In such case, there is no other alternative than to remove the plaster and apply new rendering with salt free sand. 
<br>8. Leaking pipes – The location need be traced correctly. These mainly happen in cases of soil and waste water pipes, when the pipes from inside the building pass through the wall for coming out. In most cases, there are joints at these locations. These joints need be opened up from outside and the joints or leaks repaired. As the pipe is in horizontal position, the joint must be lead caulked. In cases of rain water pipes, probable location is at the intake mouth at roof level or just below. In such case, the location need be opened carefully and the joint repaired with sand and cement mortar. In cases of water supply pipes, if the pipes laid are exposed, locating the leakage is not difficult.
<br>In cases of concealed pipes, the identification of the location is not much difficult as the dampness in the wall would indicate the position. The spot need be opened and the leak repaired. 
<br>9. In cases of dampness due to use of porous bricks and bad materials, the solution would be to  demolish the portions and reconstruct those portions with better bricks and materials. If this is not possible due to economic reasons, the remedy would be to remove the plaster from either side and then re-plaster with new mortar of richer proportion with admixture of water-proofing compound. The external plaster should be in two layers, the first layer should be laid over the brick surface after cleaning and raking the joints. 20 mm thick cement sand plaster, 1: 4 over which the second layer of plaster 10 mm thick, 1: 3 to be laid with admixture of water proofing compound. The internal plaster should be single layer 20 mm thick cement and sand 1: 4. 
<br>10. In cases of mortar joints not laid properly – This is a construction defect. The plaster on both the  faces should be removed. The mortar joints should be opened up to 20 mm deep and raked properly and then re-plastered.  
<br>11. Damp proof course – Damp proofing of a building is achieved by using suitable damp proofing  material which should satisfy the condition to be impervious to the moisture. Now, due to absence of damp proof course or due to bad construction if the damp proof course provided does not satisfy the condition above and moisture rises through the damp proof course and the walls get damp and consequently other ills appear, the commonest method in dealing with the wet rising from the soil by capillary action is insertion of a new damp proof course or replacing the old one. The simple method is to remove two layers of bricks right through the thickness of the wall at the damp proof course level. The bottom course is then replaced, after being reduced in thickness equal to the thickness of the proposed damp proof course to provide room for insertion of the damp proof course. When the lower course has been replaced, it should be covered with a bed of cement mortar 12 mm thick so as to get a uniform bearing all over. Over this, the damp proof course made of cement concrete 1: 1 ½ : 3 with admixture of water proofing compound is to be laid. Then the remaining course of brick is replaced. 
<br>
<br>They must be well buttered with cement mortar, and after being pushed into the opening, they can  be wedged down into intimate contact with the damp proof course tightly into the top bed joint. The operation should be carried out from the outside and in segments of 1.0 m to 1.2 m in length. Alternate segments are to be taken up. The whole process should be carried out slowly and with precision.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
