                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>AIR CONDITIONING<br><br>Introduction</strong><br>Air conditioning, in the most general sense of the term, means any kind of conditioning of air. This includes circulating air in a room, filtering air, cooling or heating air humidifying or dehumidifying air. Complete air conditioning would mean all such processes being carried on air in a ventilation system. Normally, when we say the space is air conditioned, we mean the air is cooled. Cooling of air can be through evaporative cooling, for example, when air flows over a bucket of ice- cold water, the water gets evaporated due to air convection and draws its latent heat required for evaporation from air, which in turn gets cooled air or through heat exchange with refrigerated water from a refrigeration plant. Again, usually air is cooled in air-conditioning units by using refrigerated water and hence a refrigeration plant is necessary for such air-conditioning systems. Before we understand the utility of all the components therein, we recall that temperature and humidity are two very important conditions for feeling of comfort. 
<br>As such, we define and explain a few terms for the basic understanding of the science of air conditioning.
<br>
<br><strong>Terminologies used in Air Conditioning
</strong><br><strong>• Psychrometry –</strong> The study and measurement of the properties of air and water vapour mixture is known as psychrometry.
<br><strong>• Dry Air –</strong> Atmospheric air consisting of a mixture of gases excluding its water vapour content is known as dry air.
<br><strong>• Moisture –</strong> The water vapour contained in air is called moisture.
<br><strong>• Moist Air –</strong> Atmospheric air along with gases and water vapour is known as moist air.
<br><strong>• Unsaturated Air –</strong> The moist air which does not contain the maximum amount of water vapour that it can hold at a given temperature is known as unsaturated air.
<br><strong>• Saturated Air –</strong> The mist air which contains the maximum amount of water vapour that it can hold at a given temperature, is known as saturated air.
<br><strong>• Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT) –</strong> The reading of temperature of air given by an ordinary mercury thermometer, having its bulb dry and not under the sun or other heat radiating objects.
<br><strong>• Dew Point Temperature (DPT) –</strong> At atmospheric temperature atmospheric air always contains water in the form of vapours .If this air is cooled down, the water vapour is turned into water droplets. This temperature at which the water vapours turns into water droplets is called dew point temperature.
<br><strong>• Wet Bulb Temperature (WBT) –</strong> Temperature of air indicated by a mercury thermometer whose bulb is covered by a piece of wet muslin is known as wet bulb temperature.
<br><strong>• Specific Humidity (SH) -</strong> It is defined as the total quantity of water vapour in the moist air.
<br><strong>• Relative Humidity (RH) -</strong> It is defined as the ratio of actual moist air content of a given volume at a particular temperature to the maximum amount of water vapour if the air is saturated at the same temperature.
<br>
<br><strong>Types of Air Conditioning
</strong><br><strong>•</strong> Centralized air – conditioning System
<br><strong>• </strong>Unit Air conditioner
<br><strong>a.</strong> Window type units
<br><strong>b. </strong>Split type units<strong><br></strong><br><strong>CENTRAL AIR-CONDITIONING
</strong><br>Central air conditioning (or central A/C) is a system in which air is cooled at a central location and distributed to and from rooms by one or more fans and ductwork. The work of the air conditioner compressor is what makes the whole process of air conditioning possible. The compression of the refrigerant gas enables it to discharge heat out of the buildings, which is how the cool air is created.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Components of Centralised Air Conditioning Plant</strong><br><br><strong>1. FRESH AIR INLET –</strong> It admits fresh air through a louver/grille situated on an outside wall very much away from the kitchen, boiler house and water closet (WC) outlets.
<br><strong>2. FILTERS –</strong> It is employed to arrest suspended particulate matter such as dirt and dust from inlet air.
<br><strong>3. AIR WASHERS –</strong> This is the air – conditioning section which comprises the pre-heater coil, refrigerating coil and banks of water sprays. The functions of air washers are to control humidity and clean air.
<br><strong>4. SCRUBBER PLATES –</strong> These are a series of zigzag plates with a stream of water running down them and are used to catch the dirt-laden water droplets coming out from the water spray section in the air washer.
<br><strong>5. WATER ELIMINATOR PLATES –</strong> These are a series of dry zigzag plates to remove any remaining free moisture in the air stream.
<br><strong>6. MIST ELIMINATOR –</strong> It is a metallic / non-metallic bed through which air is flown upwards. Fine mist is trapped in the bed and falls down as they coalesce (combine) to bigger size.
<br><strong>7. AIR HEATER -</strong> This is composed of heating coils to bring the air up to the desirable room temperature, if necessary.
<br><strong>8. INLET FAN –</strong> It is a fan for drawing air through the inlet, ducting and forcing it into the various spaces in the building.
<br><strong>9. FRESH AIR INLET/LOUVERS –</strong> They are fitted in the inlet of the fresh air for uniform entry of fresh air and hence smooth mixing with return air before entry to the air conditioning section.
<br><strong>10. ROOM INLET GRILLES –</strong> One or more grilles in each room for the controlled inflow of air.
<br><strong>11. ROOM EXTRACTION GRILLES –</strong> One or more grilles in each room for the outflow of air. One to discharge outside into the atmosphere and another leading back to the AC plant inlet for the re-circulation.
<br><strong>12. EXTRACTION FAN –</strong> It is the fan for extracting air in the return path of the air ducting coming back from rooms and spaces.
<br><strong>13. CENTRAL EXTRACTION DAMPER –</strong> In case where complete central control is exercised a part of the return air from all spaces is discharged to the atmosphere through a control damper valve in the delivery side of the extractor fan.
<br><strong>14. DUCTING –</strong> Ducting is a term used to denote the passage for flow of air from the AC plant through various passages in the building opening into the closed space to be cooled and return to the inlet ducting in the AC plant. This also includes the ducting for exhaust to the atmosphere.
<br>
<br><strong>Controls in AC systems
</strong><br>Air-conditioning control essentially involves control of temperature and humidity. These controls are effected through thermostats and humidistats, which sense the temperature and humidity of air, respectively and send control signals for corrective actions. Corrective actions include controlling (a) the temperature of air heaters, (b) the temperature of water spray, (c) the operation of refrigeration plants, and (d) the amount of recirculated air (by controlling the damper opening). Different rooms and spaces may require different conditions of air. For example, bedroom and banquet halls should have different requirements of air quality and conditions. The number of occupants should also be a factor in determining the individual requirements. Control can be achieved by any of the following three methods.
<br>
<br>1. There is complete central control where the central unit does everything and the whole building receives air at the same uniform temperature and humidity conditions
<br>
<br>2. Instead of installing the components of air washer and eliminator in the central plant, these units are located at each room so that the conditions can be controlled very locally.
<br>
<br>3. Instead of locating the air-washer components and eliminator for each room, spaces with similar requirements are grouped and separate controls with one set of components consisting of fan, filter, and cooling/heating coil is installed for each such zone.
<br>
<br><strong>Importance Points to be noted Centralised Air Conditioning Plant
</strong><br>
<br>● The central air conditioning plants or the systems are used when large buildings, hotels, theatres, airports, shopping malls etc. are to be air conditioned completely.
<br>● The air conditioning system operates essentially in a closed cycle.
<br>● Return air from different spaces in the property such as lodging rooms, dining areas, stores, banquet halls, kitchen etc. comes back through the return duct drawn by what is known as an extraction fan or exhauster.
<br>● This return air although a little stale is still cold/hot and relatively free from dirt and other contaminants present in fresh air.
<br>● Instead of exhausting the entire return gas out and sucking in fresh air only, it is returned to the circuit to minimize energy requirement for cooling/heating and filtration.
<br>
<br><br><strong>Unit Air Conditioners – Window Type AC
</strong><br>These are small self contained cabinet style units. The units are made small enough to fit into a standard window frame. Almost all the components of a central air conditioning plant and the refrigeration plants are corporate within the cabinet. The refrigeration plants (small enough to be housed within the box) provide the cook refrigerant for direct cooling the air.
<br>
<br><strong>Working of unit air conditioners
</strong><br>We recall that a vapour compression refrigeration system needs a 
<br>(a) compressor to pressurize and heat the refrigerant
<br>(b) a condenser to cool the hot refrigerant gas 
<br>(c) an expansion valve (a constriction in the pipeline carrying the refrigerant, which lowers the pressure and also the temperature of the refrigerant to a very cool state)
<br>(d) an evaporator coil through which the cool refrigerant passes and surrounding which hot room air circulates to get cool
<br>(e) appropriate refrigerant
<br>(f) pipeline for circulating the refrigerant through all the devices as mentioned. 
<br>
<br>The air-conditioning section consists of a blower (a fan which can develop higher pressure), which sucks in return air from the room through inlet louvers/ grilles over the cool evaporator coil and forces it over the same coil finally back to the room again through delivery louvers/grilles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Importance Points to be noted in Unit air conditioner
</strong><br>• This is a completely self contained unit with the compressor, condenser, evaporator, refrigerant piping and air filter all assembled in a very compact manner.
<br>• The window AC is usually 0.5 to 5 tons in capacity.
<br>• Latest practice is to use sealed type compressor units so that possibility of leakage of refrigerant is eliminated.
<br>• There is provision to control the fresh air intake.
<br>• It is easy to install, operate and maintain.
<br>• Its running cost is high.
<br>• It requires at least one wall of the room free and open to the atmosphere, so that the air is discharged in the open.
<br>
<br><strong>Refrigeration section
</strong><br>• A compressor for raising the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant
<br>• A hot coil or condenser (on the outside) to reduce the temperature of the high-pressure refrigerant
<br>• An expansion valve to reduce the pressure and chill the refrigerant
<br>• A chilled coil or the evaporator coil (on the inside) to carry the chilled refrigerant for cooling the air, in turn
<br>• Tube for carrying refrigerant
<br>
<br><strong>Air-conditioning section
</strong><br>• Chilling coil fan/blower to suck in return air from the room and force it over the chilling (or evaporator) coil
<br>• Air inlet/outlet grilles to the unit from room for re-circulating the room air in a stream-lined manner
<br>• Fresh air inlet grilles (for some models only) for admitting fresh air into the system
<br>
<strong><br>Other components/devices
</strong><br>• A fan for drawing atmospheric air to blow over hot condenser coil to lower the temperature of hot gas from the compressor
<br>• A drive motor for running the condenser fan as well as chilling the coil blower in the air-conditioning section
<br><strong>• </strong>A control unit to control temperature and humidity
<br>
<br>Models without a fresh air inlet operate entirely on recirculated air and are suitable only for rooms with small fresh air requirements. If we recollect the refrigeration system, we will notice that the first four components comprise a basic refrigeration system. The cold refrigerant passes through the chilling coil over which flows the warm air from outside (in case fresh air is admitted) and the relatively cooler return air from inside the room forced over the chilling coil by a fan. Another fan forces ; atmospheric air to cool the hot refrigerant from the compressor flowing through the hot or condenser coil. These two fans are driven by a single drive motor.<br><br><br><strong>Split-system units
</strong><br>The development of split air-conditioning units has further made the installation of room air conditioners more flexible. In this system, the cold Side of the unit (such as expansion valve, chilling coil, etc.) is physically separated from the hot side (such as hot coil or condenser coil). The refrigerant flows through a long pipeline connecting the hot side and the cold side. The cold side is placed inside the room and the hot side outside the building where there is no problem of condensation of water (during passage of atmospheric air over hot coil, moisture condenses out), which had been a problem in the old single-unit compact version for rooms having all walls inside the building. The unit consists of a long, spiral coil shaped like a cylinder. Inside the coil is a fan, to blow air through the coil, along with a weather-resistant compressor and some control logic. <br></p>
