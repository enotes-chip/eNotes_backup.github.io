<br>
<br><strong>MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT
</strong><br>The equipment which works by motors powered by electricity.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Different mechanical equipments are:-</em></strong>
<br> 
<br><strong>(I) VACUUM CLEANERS/SUCTION CLEANERS- </strong>Dust and crumbs are removed from the surface by suction.
<br>Vacuum cleaners can be classified on the basis of:-
<br>● Shape of the machine- Cylindrical, upright, backpack, dustette
<br>● Function- Dry pick up, wet pick up, dry and wet pick up, pile lifter
<br>● Centralized vacuuming system
<br>
<br><strong>DIFFERENT VACUUM CLEANERS:-</strong>
<br><strong><em>a) CYLINDRICAL VACUUM CLEANER(DRY PICK UP):-
</em></strong><br>These machines work by suction. Electricity makes the motor work and dust is collected by high suction created by the motor and sucked in through the hose and collected in the dust bag inside the machine. Various attachments are used like floor cleaning head, crevice cleaning head, upholstery cleaning head etc for cleaning different areas. Most commonly used vacuum cleaners used for guest rooms.
<br><br><strong><em>b) UPRIGHT VACUUM CLEANER( DRY PICK UP)
</em></strong><br>The main body of the machine lies horizontally on the surface and does not have attachments but has built in hose for cleaning corners and upholstery. Mainly used for large carpeted areas
<br><br><strong><em>c) BACKPACK VACUUM CLEANER/PIGGYBACK VACUUMS/PAPOOSE(DRY PICK UP):-
</em></strong><br>Small lightweight vacuum cleaners which can be strapped at the back and used to clean upholstery, curtains
<br>
<strong><em><br>e) DUSTTETTES(DRY PICK UP) :-
</em></strong><br>Small lightweight battery operated vacuum cleaners used to vacuum clean upholstery, carpet edges, mattresses, curtain and staircases etc. Can be carried in hand.
<br>
<strong><em><br>WET PICKUP VACUUM CLEANER :-
</em></strong><br>Picks up wet waste, excess waste water and used to pick up water from the floor after scrubbing. This can also be used to remove excess moisture after shampooing the carpet. The machine has a squeeze head which is used to remove excess water and collected in a tank which is emptied after use.
<br> 
<strong><em><br>LARGE TANK TYPE VACUUM CLEANER( DRY AND WET PICK UP)
</em></strong><br>Also called canister type vacuum cleaners or industrial vacuum cleaners and are used for dry and wet pick up both. Used for cleaning large areas like lobbies, banquet halls etc.
<br>
<br><strong><em>PILE LIFTER
</em></strong><br>It’s a vacuum cleaner with two motors to make it extremely strong. The pile of the carpet usually flattens in use. Pile lifters groom the pile of the carpet and restore their vertical orientation. It is not used daily. Mainly used before shampooing the carpet.
<br>
<br><strong><em>h) CENTRALIZED VACUUMING
</em></strong><br>Centralized vacuum cleaning system suction is generated at one point in a building. Soil is removed by suitable nozzles linked by flexible stretchable hoses to vacuum point. It is then conveyed by a network of pipes to a central container. This system is expensive to install and is generally done at the construction stage
<br>
<br><strong>CARE AND STORAGE OF VACUUM CLEANERS:-
</strong><br>1. Wheels should be oiled regularly
<br>2. After use, dust bags or tanks should be emptied and cleaned. 
<br>3. Clean attachment heads after cleaning work is done.
<br>4. If the machine is dry, never try to pick wet waste. v)Attachments should be stored in proper boxes.
<br>
<br><strong>(II) FLOOR MAINTENANCE MACHINE
</strong><br>This is a multi functional machine which can scrub, polish and buff the floors. The machines have driving discs (single disc or three small discs rotated in opposite directions) colored nylon pads, water tank, shampoo tank, sprayer which are used for different functions. Lighter the color of the pads, the less strong it is. For scrubbing and stripping: Scrubbing is done with scrubbing brush or with scrubbing pad(black) attached to the disc which cuts the soil.
<br>
<br>For polishing: Red colored pads to apply polish on the floor
<br>For buffing: beige or white pads are used to create high gloss finish.
<br>
<br><strong>(III) WET EXTRACTION MACHINES:-
</strong><br> 
<br>Wet extraction machines are used to restore the surface appearance of carpet, upholstery and curtains. They remove deeply embedded soil not removed by suction cleaning.
<br>Types of wet Extraction systems:-
<br>● Hot water extraction machine-They carry a hot water tank and detergent used for deep cleaning carpet with high pressure spray nozzles and a suction unit to remove soiled solution from the surface.
<br>● Solvent extraction machines- Used for cleaning upholstery and curtains.
<br>
<br><strong>(IV)	SHAMPOOING MACHINES:-
</strong><br>Brushes are made of nylon as it needs to be strong to get through the carpet pile. They are fixed to the discs of the floor maintenance machine. There are special pressure tank along with a foam generator which produces the foam in dry form which cleans the carpet and suspends the soil. This way carpet does not get too wet.
<br>
<br><strong>(V) POWER SWEEPER:-</strong>
<br>These are self or manually operated machines designed to remove debris and loose soil from floor, pavement, car park, and large areas.
<br>
<br><strong>(VI) SCARIFYING MACHINES:-</strong><strong><br></strong>Scarifying is a process of removing heavy grease, mud, thick deposits of dirt from the floor by chisel like action with a wire brush cutting tool.
<br>
<br><strong>STORAGE AND CARE OF CLEANING EQUIPMENT:-
</strong><br>● Equipment should be stored in areas which are locked properly.
<br>● Proper records of issuing equipments should be maintained(Area, attachments given, time issued, whom issued to, time of return)
<br>● Attachments and parts should be cleaned properly and stored after use.
<br>● Brushes should never be faced downwards in the floor as it would damage the bristles.
