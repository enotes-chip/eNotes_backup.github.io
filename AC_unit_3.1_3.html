</strong><br>Sauce is a hot or cold seasoned liquid either served with or used in cooking of a dish to impart flavor to the dish which is compatible (suitable) with the ingredients (of the dish). The word comes from the Latin word “salsus” which means salted since salt has always been the basic condiment.
<br>Careme and Escoffier are the two chefs who have contributed to the development of sauces in French cuisine. Careme was the first one to come up with a classification of mother sauces and Escoffier refined the sauces and added more derivatives or small sauces to these mother sauces
Demi Glace or Espagnole, velouté, tomato and hollandaise are often referred to as the “grand sauces” or “mother sauces”. Modern day chefs also classify mayonnaise as a cold mother sauce.
<br>
<br><strong>Characteristics of sauce:
</strong><br>A sauce may be thin or thick; it may be strained or it may contain visible ingredients. It may be used to season raw food (coleslaw);
<br>
<br><strong>The structure of sauces:
</strong><br>The major sauces we consider here are made of three kinds of ingredients
<br><strong>1.	</strong>A liquid , the body of sauce
<br><strong>2.</strong>	A thickening agent
<br><strong>3.</strong>	Additional seasoning and flavoring ingredients
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF SAUCES:
</strong><br>Foundation sauce/Mother sauce<br><strong>1.</strong>	Béchamel
<br><strong>2.</strong>	Velouté
<br><strong>3.</strong>	Tomato
<br><strong>4.	</strong>Espagnole
<br><strong>5.	</strong>Hollandaise
<br><strong>6.	</strong>Mayonnaise <em>(It’s added during modern cookery)&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>BECHAMEL SAUCE (White Sauce)
</strong><br>The sauce consists of milk and is thickened with white roux containing equal parts of four and butter. Marquis Louis de Béchamel (1603-1703), a seventeenth century financier who held the honorary post of chief steward of King Louis XIV’s (1643-1715) household, is said to have invented béchamel sauce.
<br>
<br>● A Béchamel sauce is made by thickening milk with white roux and simmering it with aromatics.
<br>● The milk is first reduced or boiled with aromatics such as onions wrapped with bay leaf and cloves (called onion cloute) and then thickened with roux.
<br>● When properly prepared Béchamel sauce should have a creamy flavour, reflecting its base liquid which is milk.
<br>● There should be no raw taste of roux remaining in the sauce which means that it needs to be cooked thoroughly for sufficient time.
<br>● A good béchamel sauce will have a definite shine and will be perfectly smooth with no graininess.
<br>● Béchamel sauce is finished with butter to avoid skin formation on top.
<br>

</strong><br>It literally means velvet. It is a very light blond-coloured sauce, made from chicken, fish, or veal stock thickened with a blond roux. Vélouté is specifically designed to accompany certain dishes and their recipes indicate a specific stock.
<br>
<br>● This sauce used to prepare numerous white sauces using blond roux, has a name that translates from French as velvety, soft and smooth to the palate.
<br>● A truly excellent veloute should meet several criteria such as it should have a pale ivory colour with no hint of grey, should be shiny and perfectly smooth, with no hint of graininess.<br>● The sauce should have a noticeable body thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, yet still easy to pour from a ladle.

</strong><br>The traditional French tomato sauce is thickened with a butter roux. However, tomato sauce is more commonly associated with Italian cuisine, and in particular as an accompaniment for pasta. ‘The traditional French recipe included pork, tomato concasse, tomato puree, vegetables, and seasonings that are thickened with roux. The other versions, however, do not contain roux and are based on tomato chunks and puree.
<br>
<br>There are several approaches to making a tomato sauce:&nbsp;<br>● The first approach is what is generally known as Tomato concasse which is basically prepared by using fresh tomatoes and cooking them in olive oil with garlic and onions, chopped bacon, blond roux..
<br>● The tomatoes used for making concasse are usually deskinned, deseeded and chopped  but alternatively they may be left whole along with the skin and seeds in case of bulk operation.
<br>● The other approach to what is known as Tomato sauce and is a part of the mother sauces is prepared by cooking good brown stock with plenty of fresh tomatoes and adding cooked tomato paste to the sauce reducing it considerably, straining it and serving it as a sauce.
<br> ● Tomato sauce should have a deep, rich tomato flavour, with no trace of bitterness, or acidity or sweetness. Tomato sauce is slightly coarser than any of the other mother sauces because of the degree of texture that remains even after pureeing and straining the tomatoes.
<br>● Plum tomatoes sometimes referred to as Roma tomatoes are generally preferred for Tomato sauces since they have a relatively good ratio of flesh to skin and seed.
<br>

<br><br><br><strong>BROWN SAUCE / ESPAGNOLE 
</strong><br>Espagnole, meaning ‘Spanish’ in French was the original brown sauce and still is one of the glories of the French kitchen. Thickening rich brown stock with brown roux makes the brown sauce.
<br>
<br>● Espagnole which is commonly referred to as Brown sauce was originally prepared in a lengthy process where in browned veal bones and mirepoix were reduced with ham and partridges to prepare a flavourful brown stock which was then thickened with brown roux.
<br>● This recipe was documented by Careme and the sauce was called “Espagnole” which means “Spanish sauce” after the ham which was added in the sauce as Spain during that time produced the best hams in the world.
<br>● Technically speaking it is incorrect to term modern day brown sauce as “Espagnole” because ham is no longer used these days for preparation of brown sauce.
<br>● The four basic elements of brown sauce are – brown veal stock also known as Estouffade, mirepoix cut into large dice, tomato puree and brown roux.
<br>● The stock is directly responsible for the ultimate success of the sauce and it must be of excellent quality, with a rich appealing flavour and aroma.
<br>
<br><strong>DEMI – GLACE</strong>
<br>The name demi glace translates literally as “half glaze”. The sauce is prepared by taking equal quantities of good brown sauce and brown stock or estouffade and reducing it to half of its original volume.

<br><br><br><strong>HOLLANDAISE (Dutch Sauce)
</strong><br>A warm emulsified sauce is based on egg yolks and clarified butter. Hollandaise is a French word meaning ‘Dutch style’. The sauce is named so as in carlier times ‘a la hollandaise’ indicated a dish served with melted butter, a reflection of the importance of butter in Dutch cookery. Iris thickened with the emulsification of a warm sabayon of egg yolk with the melted clarified butter.
<br>
<br>This sauce is a versatile sauce and is served as a topping on a dish and gratinated to give colors, for example, poached fish is served with gratinated hollandaise, and also the famous ‘eggs Benedict’ popularly relished in breakfast has hollandaise as the main ingredient. This sauce is served in Tess quantity as it is a heavy sauce and hence, served as topping rather than a dipping sauce.
<br>
<br>
<br>● This sauce received its name as recognition of the butter and other high quality dairy products produced in Holland.
<br>● Since the largest proportion of Hollandaise sauce is butter, the sauce will succeed or fail depending on the quality of butter as well as other factors such as temperature, and skill full balance of egg yolks.
<br>● Hollandaise belongs to a group of sauces known as emulsion sauces. An emulsion is formed when one substance is suspended in another substance – in this case clarified or melted butter is suspended in partially cooked egg yolks.
<br>● This sauce is very fragile or delicate as it is not a true mixture but a suspension of particles and can easily disintegrate or separate into individual components.
<br>● A good hollandaise sauce should have pale lemon colour with a satin smooth appearance, texture and a light and frothy consistency.
<br>● To prepare Hollandaise a reduction is made either with white wine or white wine vinegar, chopped shallots and peppercorns. Freshly squeezed lemon juice, salt and white pepper may also be added. The mixture is allowed to cool, egg yolks are added and then very carefully over a double boiler it is beaten with a whisk and a fine stream of clarified butter or melted butter is incorporated in the sauce.
<br>● The sauce will thicken as more and more butter is blended in. Hollandaise sauce should always be kept or stored at a temperature of 70ºC. Approximately 100 gm of butter should be added for each egg yolk.
<br>

<br><br><br><strong>MAYONNAISE SAUCE 
</strong><br>
<br>The invention of the sauce or the name is possibly derived from three different sources—‘mahon’,
“manier'' (meaning to stir), and ‘moyeu' (referred to the middle of the egg). Mayonnaise is a cold
emulsified sauce based on egg yolks. If it is not handled carefully, it will separate giving a curdled
appearance. It constitutes vil, egg yolk, and vinegar or lemon juice. The key is to keep the ingredients
at room temperature and not chilled. This sauce is always served cold and thus forms a base for most of the salads and sandwich fillings. Mayonnaise is generally served as the dipping sauce with snacks.
<br>Mayonnaise is an emulsified sauce. An emulsified sauce is formed when two liquids that would not ordinarily form a stable mixture are forced together and held in suspension. 
<br>
<br><strong>PREPARATION OF MAYONNAISE
</strong><br>Country: France
<br>Yields 10 portions
<br>
<br><strong><em>Ingredients
</em></strong><br>● 4 Egg yolks
<br>● 400 ml Oil Salad oil preferably
<br>● 10 g Mustard paste Dijon mustard
<br>● 10 ml Vinegar White wine vinegar
<br>● Salt, pepper To taste
<br>
<br><strong><em>Method
</em></strong><br>1. Combine egg yolks, salt, pepper, and mustard paste in a round bowl.
<br>2. Whisk to a ribbon stage and add oil continuously in a thin stream, whisking all the time.
<br>3. If the sauce becomes too thick, then add more vinegar to thin it down.
<br>4. Whisk till a stabilized emulsion is formed and it stands in firm peaks.
<br>5. Use as required.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Service
</em></strong><br>1. This sauce forms a base of many sauces and can be used on its own as well.
<br>2. It is always served cold and is usually served as a dipping sauce for snacks.
<br>3. Avoid serving mayonnaise in a silver dish, as the egg in this sauce can tarnish the silver dish.
<br><strong><em><br>Reasons for curdling mayonnaise:
</em></strong><br>● If it is exposed near heat like flame or sunlight
<br>● If the container and the whisk is not perfectly cleaned
<br>● If oil is not added carefully drop by drop.
<br>● If whisking is done randomly.
<br>● If the egg is just taken out from freeze but not thawed.
<br>● If the proper ratio of oil and egg yolk is not followed.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Correcting curdled mayonnaise 
</em></strong><br>● In a cleaned bowl put a spoonful of hot water and a pinch of mustard powder, mix well. Drop by drop add the curdled mayonnaise in it and keep on mixing. It will be rectified.
<br>● In a cleaned bowl take fresh mayonnaise and add drop by drop add the curdled mayonnaise in it. Keep on mixing. It will get rectified
<br>● In a cleaned bowl, take fresh egg yolk, drop by drop and add the curdled mayonnaise in it. Keep on mixing. It will get rectified

<br><br>●&nbsp;<strong>Soya sauce : </strong>it is the basic condiments from south east Asia and Japan. This sauce is made from soya beans, wheat, water and salt.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Worcestershire sauce :</strong> it is also known as LP sauce( lea and perrins sauce). Traditional w. sauce is thin, dark brown and pungent, with visible sediment.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Ketchup :</strong> commercial ketchup is like  smooth tomato sauce, and it is highly seasoned.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Tabasco sauce :</strong> the chilli or hot red pepper is the principal ingredient of commercially prepared hot sauce.
<br>
<strong><br>MAKING OF A GOOD SAUCE
</strong><br>Following are the points to be kept in mind while making a good sauce:
<br>
<br><strong>1.</strong> Always use good quality stock to make sauces.
<br><strong>2.</strong> The sauce should be smooth and glossy unless specified for a purpose.
<br><strong>3.</strong> Never allow a skin to form on top of a sauce as this will result in lumps, when mixed later.
<br><strong>4.</strong> Cook the sauce for a long time, this would intensify the flavours in the sauce and it would also provide a gloss to the sauce.
<br><strong>5.</strong> Always season the sauce in the end, as the reduction of the sauce will result in a salty sauce.
<br><strong>6.</strong> Skim the sauce whenever necessary.
<br><strong>7.</strong> Always use correct utensils to make sauces.
<br><strong>8.</strong> The flavour of the main ingredient should stand out in the sauce.
<br><strong>9.</strong> For white sauces, use only white mirepoix.
<br><strong>10.</strong> Check the seasoning in the cold sauces before serving, as the seasoning goes down once the sauce is chilled.
<br><strong>11. </strong>Add creams and liaisons only in the end and do not boil the sauce thereafter.
<br><strong>12.</strong> Always cook the flour before adding to a sauce as a thickening agent.
<br><strong>13.</strong> While storing the sauces in the refrigerator, keep them unfinished.
<br><strong>14.</strong> Never store the sauce beyond two days, as the quality will deteriorate.
<br>
<br><strong>MODERN TRENDS OF MAKING SAUCES</strong>
<br>While in olden times, the sauces were creamy and thickened with flour and starch, the modern trend is to avoid using very creamy and flour-based sauces. This change has come over with globalization of the world, The world has shrunk and with people travelling all over the world, they are more aware of sauces used in other parts of the world. Let us see the various trends in modern sauce making:
<br>
<br><strong>1. </strong>Stocks are naturally thickened by reducing till a glossy sauce is obtained. Thickeners, such as roux and arrowroot, are not used these days in Western cooking because of health reasons. Flour is a simple carbohydrate and is not as healthy as whole wheat flour.
<br><strong>2.</strong> Combination of flavours around the world such as pan-fried fish served with a teriyaki sauce or
<br>crispy fried prawns served with spicy tomato salsa is very common on most of the restaurant menus.
<br><strong>3. </strong>Olive oil-based, fruit-based, and herb-based sauces are very popular these days.
<br><strong>4. </strong>Vegetables are widely being used as sauces with meats and vegetable dishes.
