<br>The invention of currency and the wheel sometime in the fifth century BC are regarded as the two main factors that led to the emergence of inn-keeping and hospitality as a commercial activity. While Europe can safely be regarded as the cradle of the organized hotel business, it is in the American continent that one sees the evolution of the modern hotel industry over the past century. From the rudimentary ancient inns to the present-day state-of-the-art establishments that provide everything under the sun to the modern traveler, the hotel industry has come a long way. The origin and growth of the hotel industry in the world can be broadly studied under the following periods: 
<br>
<br>⦿ Ancient Era
<br>⦿ Grand Tour
<br>⦿ Modem Era
<br>
<br><strong>Ancient Era 
</strong><br>The earliest recorded evidence of hospitality facilities in Europe dates back to 500 BC. Ancient cities, such as Corinth in Greece, had a substantial number of establishments that offered food and drink as well as beds to travelers. The inns of the biblical era were of primitive type, offering a cot or bench in the corner of a room and, at times, even a stable. Travelers used to stay in a large hall. Privacy and personal sanitation were non-existent. In the third century AD, numerous lodging premises mushroomed along with the extensive network of brick paved roads throughout Europe and minor Asia (part of Asia adjoining Europe). The lodging houses were known as <em>mansionis</em> during that time. 
<br>
<br>These conditions prevailed for several hundred years, till the Industrial Revolution in England led to the development of railways and steamships, making traveling more efficient, comfortable, and faster. The Industrial Revolution also brought about a shift in the focus of travel that became more business-oriented than educational or social. 
<br>
<br>The lead-in organized hotel-keeping, as we see it today, was taken by the emerging nations of Europe, especially Switzerland. The early establishments were mainly patronized by the aristocracy and took shape in chalets (small cottages)&nbsp; and small hotels that provided a variety of services. Between 1750 and 1825, inns in Britain gained the reputation of being the finest hospitality establishments. 
<br>
<br><strong>Grand Tour</strong> 
<br>The second half of the eighteenth century, prior to the French Revolution (1789-9914 is referred to as the 'golden era of travel' as the popularity of the 'Grand Tour' gave a big push to the hotel industry. In those days, a Grand Tour of the European continent constituted an indispensable element of the education of scions of wealthy families in Britain. As this tour often lasted several years, it was a good business opportunity for people in the prominent cities of France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Ireland to establish lodging, transportation, and recreation facilities. Far-sighted entrepreneurs, who smelt money in the exercise, developed the skills of hospitality and pioneered the modern hotel industry.
<br>
<br>Prominent among the hotels that emerged during this period were Dolder Grand in Zurich, The Imperial in Vienna, the Vier Jahreszeiten in Hamburg, and Des Bergues in Geneva. In 1841, a simple cabinet maker, Thomas Cook, organized a rail tour from Leicester to Loughborough, and immortalized himself as the world's first tour operator. 
<br>
<br><strong>Modern Era 
</strong><br>The improvisation in modes of transport made journeys safer, easier, and faster, enabling economic as well as a frequent mass movement. The introduction of Funiculars (the rope way) made high altitude mountains accessible, leading to the growth of many hotels in the Alpine ranges. Birkenstock and Giessbach are among the hotels in Switzerland that owe their existence to the development of the rope ways. 
<br>The two world wars, especially the second (1939-45), took their toll on the hospitality industry. The massive destruction caused by the war and the resulting economic depression proved to be a major setback for the travel business. The 1950's witnessed the slow and steady growth of travel in the European continent. The development of aircraft and commercial passenger flights across the Atlantic stimulated travel across the globe, and in the process accelerated the growth of the hotel industry. 
<br>
<br>But it is the American entrepreneurs who are credited with literally changing the face of the hospitality industry with their innovations and aggressive marketing. The inauguration of the City Hotel in New York in 1794 marked the beginning of the present-day hotel industry. It was a 'giant' building at that time, with 73 rooms, and it went on to become a favorite meeting ground for socialites. 
<br>Prior to the establishment of the City Hotel, lodging facilities in the American continent were patterned on European-style taverns or inns. The  City Hotel, however, triggered a race of sorts among  American hoteliers, resulting in the construction of large hotels like the Exchange Coffee House in Boston, the second City Hotel in Baltimore, Mansion House in Philadelphia, etc. The opening of the Tremont House in Boston is another landmark in the evolution of the hotel industry. Regarded as a forerunner of luxury hotels, the 170-room hotel had many firsts to its credit. For example, it was the first to provide locks, indoor plumbing, running water, and bathing facilities, besides providing a bowl, pitcher, and free soaps in its rooms. It was also the first to provide front office services like bell boys and a reception. It was also the first hotel to serve French cuisine in the US.
<br> 
<br>Throughout the nineteenth century, the contest among hoteliers to build better, larger, and most luxurious hotels continued. Several luxury hotels, like the Grand Pacific, The Palmer House, and The Sherman House in Chicago, as well as The Palace (with 800 rooms) in San Francisco, were built. The year 1908 saw the emergence of the first business hotel, the Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York. This magnificent 450-room multi-story building was a pioneer in many ways. Some of the innovations included an attached bathroom with hot and cold water in each room, an electric lamp on the desk, and a radio in each room. 
<br>
<br>The decade of the great depression in the 1930s witnessed the liquidity of most of the hotels in America. The hotel industry streamlined with slow and steady growth during the 1940s. The increase in automobile travel in the 1950s led to the rise of 'motor hotels' or motels, a new category in the hotel industry. The motels, which offered free parking facilities, served as rest houses for people traveling between two cities or tourist destinations. The following decades saw the growth of motels on a large scale, and also the introduction of budget hotels that offered basic facilities at half the rates. Gradually, with the passage of time, these evolved into countrywide and international chains.
<br>
<br><strong>EVOLUTION AND GROWTH OF THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IN INDIA 
</strong><br>Although the origin of the hotel industry in India cannot be traced to a definite point in time, there is evidence of its presence even during the Indus Valley Civilization and Vedic era. In the olden days, travel was predominantly undertaken for pilgrimage and trade. The concept of <em>char Dham</em> (i.e., visiting religious places located in the four comers of India) among the Hindu community is an important indicator of the significance accorded to pilgrimage by our ancestors. The country stands dotted with many such shrines, some of which are frequented by people of all faiths. Some such popular destinations are Vaishno Devi, Amarnath cave shrine in Kashmir, Tirupati Balaji, Shirdi Sai, Sikh Golden Temple in Amritsar, Dilwarajain temples at Mount Abu, Bodhgaya for Buddhists, Ajmer Sharif shrine in Rajasthan, Haji Ali Tomb in Mumbai, St. Francis Church in Goa, etc. Ancient texts and literature, as also Hindu mythology, have many references to travel and the provision of accommodation facilities for traveling pilgrims and traders by the authorities of those days. 
<br>
<br>Ancient India was well known for its silk, spices, gold, and gemstones. Records of famous travelers of the yore speak of Indians trading with countries like Greece, Italy, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, and Japan, among others. The main mode of transport were animals on land, and boats and ships that criss.-crossed rivers and seas for connectivity with distant lands. That is why we find major trading cities in the world situated along the banks of rivers or on seaports. 
<br><br>The origin and evolution of the hotel industry in the country can be broadly categorized in the following three periods: 
<br>
<br>» Ancient and Medieval Era (from Indus Valley Civilization to AD 1600)
<br>» Colonial Era (AD 1601 to AD 1947) 
<br>» Modem Era (1947 onwards) 
<br>
<br><strong>Ancient and Medieval Era (from Indus Valley Civilization to AD 1600) 
</strong><br>The beginnings of the hospitality sector in India stand rooted in the Hindu philosophy of '<strong><em>Atithi Devo bhava</em></strong> ', implying that an unannounced guest is to be accorded the status of God. While it is not clear when hospitality emerged as a commercial activity in ancient India, there is evidence of accommodation facilities for travelers and guests, though not as organized as we see them today. The lodging houses during those times were known as Dharamshala (dharma in Sanskrit means religion and shala school). 
<br>Dharamshala, the resting places for pilgrims, are believed to have their origins in village chaupals, which served as a meet­ing ground for villagers to plan and discuss various social welfare and development measures. These became the places of lodging as travelers started putting up camps there due to safety reasons. Gradually, with the help of local residents and financial assistance from the rulers, <em>Zamindars</em>, or other influential people, permanent structures ( or Dharamshala’s) were built for travelers. Here they were provided with a safe place to relax and spend the night. Other words in the literature that are indicative of according facilities to travelers are anna-kshetras (anna means food grains and kshetra area), bhojnalaya (bhojana means meal and Alaya house), paakashala (paak means cooking and shala school), panthagar (panth means way or road and agar house), etc. Similarly, in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, there is a mention of the existence of avasathagar (the outer portion of the house) to accommodate people who were invited during festivals, yagnas, or other celebrations organized by kings. 
<br>
<br>Records of many foreign visitors and philosophers who came to India speak highly of the hospitality facilities. Famous Chinese scholars Fa Hien (AD 399-414) and Huein Tsang (AD 629-643), who came during the reigns of Chandragupta Vikramiditya and Harshvardhana respectively, have mentioned the existence of shelters for travelers. Huein Tsang has, in fact, referred to the wonderful arrangement of food for 10,000 students in Nalanda University, a famous seat of learning. 
<br>In the medieval era, between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, many sarais and musafir khanas were built, primarily as resting places for messengers of the postal system established by the Sultans of the Slave or Mamluk dynasty. The system was refined by Alauddin Khiljee, who established dak chowkis with horse runners and messengers to deliver posts. According to the Tarikh-i-Sher-Shahi by Abbas Khan Sherwan, the postal service Diwan-i-Jnsa employed nearly 3,400 people to man 1,700 horse-relay stations at sarais, which also served as post offices. The Mughals continued the practice and built many such sarais to accommodate travelers. The sarais during those times fulfilled the basic necessities of a traveler-they provided water, a room, a stable for the livestock (like horse, elephant, or camel) along with fodder, and sometimes also a place for worship. There are several localities in Delhi, such as Katwaria Sarai, Lado Sarai, Sarai Kale Khan, that have retained their names till date, although the medieval constructions are hard to find. 
<br>
<br><strong>Colonial Era (1601-1947</strong>) 
<br>The organized existence of the hotel industry in India started taking shape during the colonial period, with the advent of Europeans in the seventeenth century. The early hotels were mostly operated by people of foreign origin to cater to the needs of the European colonizers and later officials of the Raj. Among the first such properties were taverns like Portuguese Georges, Paddy Goose's, and Racquet Court, which opened in Bombay (now Mumbai} between 1837 and 1840. However, within a period of about ten years, most of the taverns disappeared and more respectable hotels like Hope Hall Family Hotel began to make an appearance. Other famous properties included the Victoria Hotel, more famous as British Hotel, by Pallanjee Pestonjee in 1840; Esplanade Hotel in 1871; Watson's, which was exclusively for Europeans; Auckland Hotel (1841) in Kolkata, which went on to become the Great Eastern Hotel in post-independent India, and so on. 
<br><br>In December 1903, Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata, inaugurated the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, overlooking the Gateway of India in Mumbai, following a racial discrimination incident wherein he was refused entry into the Watson's Hotel for being an Indian. The hotel, which is an architectural marvel, is credited with being the first luxury hotel for Indians by an Indian. In 1923, Shapurji Sorabji built the Grand Hotel in Mumbai. A few years later, the Majestic Hotel was opened. 
<br>Until 1900, almost all hotels were constructed and run as per Western traditions. The first Indian-style hotels were Sardar Griha, which _opened in 1900, and Madhavashram in 1908. The two world wars brought a fresh lot of hotels to Mumbai, an important port city of the times. The Ritz, The Ambassador, West End, and Airlines, which opened during these years, are fondly referred to as 'war babies' by industry historians. 
<br>
<br><strong>Modern Era (1947 onwards)
</strong><br>Post-independence, there were big leaps in the hotel trade in the country. The Oberoi Group of Hotels (founded by Rai Bahadur Mohan Singh Oberoi) and the Taj Group took over several British properties, maintained high standards of service and quality, and expanded their business overseas. The later decades saw corporates like the ITC (Indian Tobacco Company) also join the hotel industry with properties under ITC WelcomGroup. The year 1949 saw the organization of four regional hotels and restaurants associations with head offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta (now Kolkata), and Madras (now Chennai). These four associations were linked in a federation, the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants in India (FHRAI), in 1955. The federation serves as an interface between the hospitality industry, political leadership, government, international associations, and other stakeholders in the trade. 
<br><br>The Ashok Hotel in Delhi's diplomatic enclave has the distinction of being the first luxury hotel built by the government. It was founded in 1956 to host independent India's first-ever international event, a United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) conference. Realizing the importance and potential of the tourism and hospitality industry, the government constituted India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) in 1966, which opened many large and small hotels across the country. The most popular face of ITDC is the Ashoka group of hotels that provides a wide range of hospitality-related services. 
<br>Over the last few decades, various well-known international hotel chains have come to India. These include Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, InterContinental Hotels and Resorts, Marriott International, Hilton Hotels, Best Western International, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Carlson Hotels Worldwide, and Aman Resorts. 
<br>
<br><strong>Current Scenario</strong> The liberalization of the Indian economy has provided a boost to the hotel industry in a big way, leading to a sharp rise in the number of inbound and domestic tourists in the last two decades. While the main focus of the international traveler has shifted from seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra and sunbathing on Goan beaches to doing business with one of the world's fastest-growing economies, the boom in the information technology and other service sectors has placed substantial disposable incomes in the hands of Indian people, spurring the travel urge in them. 
<br>According to Tarun Thakaral, Chief Operating Officer, Le Meridien, a leading business hotel in Delhi, the gap between demand and supply of hotel rooms is also growing. There is currently a shortage of 1,50,000 rooms, fuelling hotel room rates across India. The industry estimates that the demand is going to exceed supply by at least 100 percent over the next two years. Five-star hotels in metro cities allot the same room more than once a day to different guests, receiving almost 24-hour rates from both guests against six to eight hours usage. With demand-supply disparity, hotel rates in India are likely to rise by 25 percent annually and occupancy by 80 percent over the next two years. 
<br>This growth is attributed to the country's 'Incredible India!' international marketing campaign, which mounted a concerted effort in international print and electronic media, besides Internet and outdoor advertising and roadshows, to showcase the country's tourism-friendly aspects. India's open skies policy has also led to massive growth in travel for business and pleasure. The upgrading of national highways connecting various parts of India has opened new avenues for the development of budget hotels here. All this has resulted in exciting opportunities for the hotel industry.<br></p>
