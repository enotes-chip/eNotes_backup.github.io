                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Plastics
</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong><em>Types of plastic</em></strong>
<br>1. Thermosetting Plastic
<br>2. Thermoplastic.
<br> 
<br><strong>Thermosetting Plastic
</strong><br>These are strong, hard plastics and not softened by heat. These are used to produce plastic laminates. Plastic laminates are made by subjecting layers of paper impregnated with plastic resin to high pressure and temperature.  These are of two types Melamines and Phenolics.
<br>● Melamines: these are used for tableware, tray, and laminate worktops. Brand names can be: Formica, Laminex
<br>● Phenolics: these are used for buckets, mugs, telephone, toilet seat, etc. These can be boiled so suited in kitchen or hospitals
<br><br><strong>Thermoplastic
</strong><br>Majority of items in hotels &amp; other institutions fall into this category:
<br><strong><em>● Acetal Resins:</em></strong> these resist boiling, chipping &amp; scratching, and are used for knife handles in particular
<br><strong><em>● Acrylics: </em></strong>although extremely lightweight &amp; strong they will scratch easily and are damaged by contact with very hot liquids. They are used for furniture &amp; protective panels.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Cellulose Acetate &amp; Nitrate:</em></strong> this is pliable plastic used for brush handles, light fittings, lampshades, etc.
<br>●<strong><em> Polyamide:</em></strong> this is used for kitchenware, knife handles, brushes (bristles), curtain fitting, abrasive pads, etc. It will withstand sterilization.
<br><strong><em>● Polyester</em></strong>: this may be used on its own trays, lampshades, etc. or it may be reinforced with glass fibers and molded into laundry skips, it is also used in the construction of resin seamless floorings.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polyethylene/ Polythene:</em></strong> used for plastic bags, squeeze bottles, etc.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polypropylene: </em></strong>used for dustbins, buckets, etc. can withstand sterilization.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polystyrene: </em></strong>This is found in three forms. The crystal type—is clear, glossy &amp; brittle and used for domestic kitchen utensils &amp; equipment. Toughened varieties—used for refrigerator linings, fan blades, etc. Expanded polystyrene—used as tiles.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polyurethane Foam:</em></strong> the rigid fabric used for insulation but it is more frequently found in the manufacture of mattresses, carpet underlays, sponges, mops, as a clear seal for wooden furniture, etc. It gives heat and sound insulation but there is a considerable fire risk. Foam can be treated for fire resistance but it becomes too expensive
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE):</em></strong> used in kitchenware and on the base of irons.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC):</em></strong> It is used in the form of tiles or sheets. It is used to coat wallpaper, wood products, or as a floor covering to render them washable. In its rigid form, it is used in the curtain tracks, soil, and waste pipes, electrical conduits etc.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong><em>Acrylonitrile:</em></strong> this plastic is used for tableware &amp; for outer casings of vacuum cleaners, etc.
<br><br><strong><em>Note:-</em></strong> Synthetic fibers:- Polyamide, Polyester, and acrylic can be formed into fibers/ long filaments which have great strength, poor absorbency, durable, are easy to clean, and quick to dry. They are used to make carpets, curtains, beddings, uniforms, etc.
<br> 
<br><strong>Maintaining and Care Plastics
</strong><br>● Dusting
<br>● Light soiling can be removed by wiping with warm synthetic detergent, followed by rinsing, drying &amp; buffing
<br>● The textured surface may need scrubbing with a soft brush
<br>● Stains can be removed by rubbing with a clean cloth soaked in methylated spirit
<br>● Small items may be soaked in hypochlorite bleach
<br><br><strong>Points to be kept in mind:
</strong><br>● Keep away from direct heat or flames
<br>● Do not use harsh abrasives
<br>● Do not drag a heavy object over plastic surfaces or chop or cut on them
<br>● Keep away from strong acid or alkalis
<br>● Some plastics are damaged if heavy objects are dropped on to them&nbsp;<br></p>
