</strong><br>Fruits are a rich source of vitamins and minerals and give the necessary nutrition to our body. Fruits are generally eaten raw, but many of them can be cooked to serve as accompaniments, sauces, or compotes. Some fruits are rich in ‘pectin’, an enzyme that helps in the setting of jams and marmalades. Fruits have been paired with food since time immemorial.
<br>Fruits are pulpy in character,often juicy &amp; generally developed from flowers of plants &amp; consist of a ripened seed or seeds with some edible tissues attached
<br>
<strong><br>Why Eat Fruits?
</strong><br>Fruits have a very positive effect on the brain; the most important substance that fruits contain are water (80 percent) and natural sugars. Natural sugars help to stimulate the brain so we can think faster and recall information more quickly. Fruits do not contain any amount of bad cholesterol; therefore, they are amongst the healthiest foods available. Fruits are rich in fibre and vitamins such as vitamin C.
<br>
<br><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF FRUITS
</strong><br>In botanical terms, a fruit is the ripened ovary of a flowering plant. A fruit usually contains the seeds of the plane that bears it. A number of fruits are also termed as vegetables by some, as there is no single terminology that can accurately fit the variety that can be found among plant fruit. Fruits can be broadly segregated on their composition, nutritional value, shape, and flavour. They could be sweet or sour, depending on the variety. Some are fleshy, some are dry, and some are heavy. It is to be noted that as per culinary terminology, a fruit is defined as a product that has a sweet taste. Fruits generally contain water soluble vitamins such as vitamins B and C. They also have a generous amount of antioxidants present in them. It is for this reason that fruits dis-colour once cut, as the exposure to oxygen instigates chemical reaction with the antioxidants.
<br><br>Some fruits, known as ‘pseudo-carp’, are accessory fruits, for example, figs. They are not the ripened ovary, but are attached to the plant embryo. Certain fruits are produced without the fusion of the ovary and the embryo. They are artificially produced by a method called ‘parthenocarpy’, in which pollination is omitted. These fruits are seedless. Plants that are non-fruit producing are known as “acarpous”. Fruits are widely used in various ways such as cooked, raw, canned, pureed and squashed
<br>
<br><strong>On Basis of Texture and Flavour
</strong><br>Fruits are classified on the basis of their texture and flavour and can be classified into:
<br>
<br>● <strong>Soft Fruits :</strong> Papaya, banana, melons, etc.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Stone Fruits :</strong> Peaches, Mango, etc.
<br>● <strong>Apple &amp; Pear family :</strong> All apples and pears
<br>●<strong> Citrus Fruits :</strong> Orange, sweet lime, pineapple, etc.
<br>
<br><strong>On Basis of Appearance and Flesh Content
</strong><br>
<br><strong>Fleshy fruits
</strong><br>These are fruits that have supple flesh around the seed. They can be subdivided again into those formed from and those formed from a group of flowers. Those formed from a single flower are classified as berry, drupe. aggregation of drupes, pomme, and hesperidium. Fruits that grow from a group of flowers and generate only a single seed are sorosis (c.g.. mulberry), syconium (e.g., fig), and coenocarpium (e.g.. pineapple).
<br>
<br><strong>Dry fruits
</strong><br>Dry fruits are seeds of a fruit confined in a nut. So all nuts such as pistachio, cashew, almonds, and walnuts are dry fruits. Not all seeds of fruits are edible and only a few can be eaten as dry fruits. Many people also dehydrate fresh fruits for preservation and these should not be confused with dry fruits. The dehydrated fruits are simply known as dried fruits.
<br>
<br><strong>STORAGE OF FRUITS
</strong><br>● hard fruits such as apples should be stored in boxes.
<br>● Soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, should be left in their own punnets.
<br>● Stoned fruit are stored in a tray and must be individually placed so that any damaged fruit can be discarded easily.
<br>● Peaches and citrus fruits are left in the delivery tray only.
<br>● Bananas should not be stored in cool places because their skin turns black.
<br>
<br><strong>QUALITY AND PURCHASING POINTS FOR FRUITS</strong>
<br>● Soft fruits should not be damaged or overripe.
<br>● Soft fruits should appear fresh without signs of mould,writing and shrinkage.
<br>● Certain fruits are purchased on the basis of appearance such as strawberries.
<br>● Hard fruits should not be bruised.
<br>
<br><strong>FRUITS IN COOKING
</strong><br>The use of fruits in cooking dates back hundreds of years, Although fruits are most commonly used in desserts, they can also form part of savoury dishes. Fruits are also found in foods such as cookies, muffins, yoghurt, ice cream, and cakes. Fruits are not only used in preparing a variety of dishes, but they also help keep certain foods fresh and help preserve their colour. There are various ways to cook fruit, and certain considerations should be made beforehand as fruit tends to be delicate and can disintegrate easily, They are discussed as below:
<br>
<br><strong>1. </strong>Boiling is too harsh a method for most fruits; gentle simmering preserves the texture and shape of
fruits. When cooking soft and stone fruits, simply warm them by placing them in a pan of boiled water.
<br><br><strong>2. </strong>Poaching is a similar method, and is a common way to cook fruits such as pears. Bring the water to a simmer and then gently lower the fruit into the pan with a spoon. Immediately reduce the heat
so the liquid is barely bubbling, and cooks until the fruit is tender.
<br><br><strong>3. </strong>Stew fruit, where the saucepan is covered and the fruit is cooked in just enough liquid to cover it. This not only helps keeping the moisture, but helps to avoid expelling nutrients and be left with only the fibrous part. Use just enough moisture to cook the fruit. As with cooking vegetables, it is important to retain the crunch while cooking fruits.
<br><br><strong>4. </strong>Barbecuing and grilling fruit leads to very sweet, strong flavours; this is due to the intense heat that caramelizes the sugars. Grilled or barbecued fruits make fantastic desserts, side dishes, or appetizers.<br><br><strong>5.</strong> Once cut, the fruit should be soaked in water to maximize the amount of liquid inside. This prevents the fruit from drying out on the grill. Adding I tsp of lemon juice to the water will help the fruit preserve its colour. It is also a good idea to try grilling bananas, tangerines, and pineapples on their skin. In general, leaving the skin or peel on the fruit helps to maintain its structural integrity as it cooks.
<br><br><strong>6. </strong>Sauces of fruits are used to marinate the fruits before grilling them and they can also be served with the fruits after grilling.
<br><br><strong>7. </strong>Drying is also a good way of preserving fruits and it intensifies their flavours. Most fruits can be
dried effectively.
<br><br><strong>8. </strong>Fruits also can be used as coulis. A coulis is a form of thin sauce made from puréed and strained vegetables or fruits. ie. Raspberry coulis, blueberry coulis, Peach coulis, Blackberry coulis, cherry coulis &amp; etc
<br>
<br>Fruit can be made into jams, jellies, pickles, and chutneys, or can be bottled whole. The most suitable the method of preservation depends on the type of fruit and its quality and ripeness. Underripe fruit is fine for chutneys, jams, and jellies but overripe fruit is only good for making chutney and should not be used for making jam.
