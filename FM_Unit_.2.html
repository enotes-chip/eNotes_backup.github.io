                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>CONTRACT MAINTENANCE</strong>
<br>• Contract Maintenance is defined as the contract between 2 parties which creates the agreement that one party will maintain an asset owned by another party, which is common across many industries.
<br>• Maintenance contracts can exist for equipment, a building, landscape, computers and other information technologies, and more.
<br>• The decision to perform a particular maintenance activity in – house or through contract is usually decided by the head of the Maintenance Department.
<br>
<br><strong>TYPES OF CONTRACT FOR MAINTENANCE SERVICES
</strong><br>1. Piece Work or Piece Rate Contract
<br>2. Lump Sum Rate Contract
<br>3. Rate Contract
<br>4. Service Contract
<br>5. Multi Stage Contract
<br>
<br><strong>Possible Circumstances for availing Contract Maintenance
</strong><br>• While contract maintenance may cover all possible types of maintenance including routine, preventive an corrective maintenance, some specific areas or circumstances might require contract maintenance as mentioned below.
<br>• Contract Maintenance may handle special needs of a property involving special equipment's or when such needs are infrequent in nature ie. Fire Extinguishers, Lifts, Fire Alarm Systems, Detectors, Sensors etc.
<br>• Contract Maintenance may be called upon for routine services such as janitorial services for all sorts of building interior cleaning.
<br>• Ground maintenance and special maintenance needs like pest control activities (needing license from IPCA) are generally awarded to contract maintenance.
<br>• In many properties, operation and maintenance of water treatment, sewage treatment and swimming pool maintenance are left to contract service owing to their very sophisticated nature.
<br>• At small establishments, air – conditioning and refrigeration units are also maintained through contract service.
<br>• Special equipment's are often needed for cleaning kitchen ducting, grease trap, grease filters etc., and their maintenance is also often contracted out.
<br>
<br><strong>Role of the Maintenance Department in Contract Maintenance
</strong><br>1. Apart from identifying the areas that need to be brought under contract maintenance and choosing an appropriate contractor the Chief Engineer has to also ensure the following.
<br>2. The contract has to carefully framed to clearly define the definite area of work to perform.
<br>3. The Maintenance department has to closely monitor and control the reliability and quality of maintenance being carried out by them.
<br>4. Periodic review is to be made to ascertain the need of any change in the nature of the contract including a possible change in the contractor.
<br>5. The access to the property in areas other than the area of work should be restricted for the employees of the contractor.
<br>6. Behavioral Issues
<br>7. The Chief Engineer has to ensure that the contractor is following required safety standards for their employees and they are covered by appropriate insurance policies.
<br>
<br><strong>ADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE
</strong><br>• Reduction of total labour cost.
<br>• Reduction of cost of carrying inventory and special maintenance equipment.
<br>• Use of latest techniques and methods of maintenance.
<br>• Saving in administrative time on the part of the engineers when they can concentrate more on planning, etc.
<br>• Structure and infrastructural facilities of the in-house maintenance department need not change due to introduction of new equipment's with sophisticated technology.
<br>• Flexibility to meet emergencies
<br>• Reduction of labour problem.
<br>• Need to recruit and train employees is eliminated.
<br>
<br><strong>DISADVANTAGES OF CONTRACT MAINTENANCE 
</strong><br>• Labour cost is not really saved unless the actual number of in-house maintenance staff is reduced.
<br>• Revision of contract fees in subsequent years often leads to escalation of total cost if not properly negotiated and controlled.
<br>• Often the specialized nature of the maintenance would lead to high charges for such contracts leading to a overall increase in maintenance cost compared to if it were maintained in house.
<br>• At the time of bidding, lack of initiative on the part of the Chief Engineer would often lead to a non-competitive price quote by a handful on contractors.
<br>• Reduction in the number of specialized in-house maintenance crew may result in their unavailability in case of an emergency requirement for some other facility.
<br>• The Chief Engineer does not get any information feedback regarding the status of the equipment under contract maintenance, except in case when it completely breaks down.
<br>• Loss of control over contractor employees.
