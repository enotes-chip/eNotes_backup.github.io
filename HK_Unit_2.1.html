                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Frequency of Cleaning
</strong><br>Cleaning tasks may be divided according to the frequency of their scheduling, which depends upon :
<br>● The level of soiling,
<br>● The type of surface,
<br>● The amount of traffic,
<br>● The type of hotel, and
<br>● The cleaning standards are set.
<br>● The greater the amount of soiling, the greater will be
<br>● Frequency of cleaning carried out.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Cleaning tasks are carried out as per one of the following frequency:-
</em></strong><br>● Daily Tasks
<br>● Weekly Tasks
<br>● Periodic Tasks
<br>
<br><strong>Daily Tasks:
</strong><br>These are routine operations carried out on a day-to-day basis by the staff of the housekeeping department. These include the regular servicing of guestrooms, cleaning of bathrooms and toilets, suction-cleaning of floors and floor coverings, and so on.
<br>
<br><strong>Weekly Tasks:
</strong><br>These, as the term implies, are routine tasks carried out on a weekly basis. These may include the polishing of metal surfaces, dusting of hard-to-reach areas, and so on.
<br><br><strong>Periodic Tasks:
</strong><br>These are carried out on a monthly, quarterly (every three months), half yearly or annual basis.
<br>Spring-cleaning is a special type of periodic cleaning.
<br>Some of the usual periodic tasks in a hotel include the shampooing of carpets, washing of walls, cleaning of chandeliers, and stripping and polishing of floors. The higher the standards required, the greater is the task carried out daily and greater the amount of soiling, the greater will be frequency which is carried out.
<br>
<br><strong>Organization of Cleaning
</strong><br>For cleaning to be efficient, it must be well organized. Different ways of organizing the cleaning of various areas are outlined below:-
<br>● Orthodox/conventional/traditional cleaning
<br>● Block Cleaning
<br>● Team Cleaning
<br>● Deep Cleaning and special projects
<br>● Spring Cleaning
<br>
<br><strong>Orthodox/Conventional/Traditional Cleaning
</strong><br>In this way of cleaning, a GRA completes all the tasks in one guestroom before going on to the next room in the section allotted to him/her.
<br>On an average, a GRA may be required to clean 12-20 rooms in an 8-hour workday.
<br><strong>Block Cleaning
</strong><br>In this way of cleaning, the GRA moves from room to room and completes the same task in every room, before returning to begin the cycle again for the next task on the list. This involves ‘blocking’ several rooms at a time to form a ‘room section’ and usually more than one GRA will be at work in the section.
<br>For instance, one GRA might take all the beds in that particular room section, while another GRA cleans the toilets, and the third GRA dusts and cleans the area, replenishing supplies that are low.
<br><strong>Team Cleaning
</strong><br>In this method, two or more people work together in the same area, either on the same task or on different tasks. To organize the team cleaning of guestrooms, two GRAs may be scheduled to clean 30-35 guestrooms a day.
<br><strong>Deep Cleaning &amp; Special Projects</strong>
<br>Deep cleaning refers to the intensive cleaning schedule in which periodic cleaning tasks are scheduled for monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annual frequencies. Deep cleaning involves some tasks that require the housekeeping department to work in coordination with the maintenance department.
<br>Many tasks involved in deep cleaning are complicated and time consuming ones, requiring special equipment, techniques, expertise, and group effort. These tasks are usually scheduled as special projects.
<br>Deep cleaning tasks include the following:
<br>● Shampooing carpets
<br>● Vacuum-cleaning upholstery, mattresses, and bed bases.
<br>● Rotating and turning mattresses
<br>● Thoroughly cleaning of furniture and polishing of wooden furniture.
<br>● Stripping, re-sealing, re-polishing, and buffing of floors.
<br>● Cleaning hard-to-reach areas such as ceilings, top edges of doors, fans, air-conditioning vents, and so on
<br>● Cleaning ornate lighting fixtures such as chandeliers.
<br>● Thorough cleaning of walls, windows, and curtain tracks.
<br>● Cleaning signage boards.
<br>● Thorough washing of bathroom floors, walls, fixtures, fittings, and shower curtains.
<br>● Laundering of washable soft furnishings.
<br>
<br><strong>Spring Cleaning (Special Cleaning)
</strong><br>It involves periodic annual cleaning of hotel guestrooms or other areas, carried out in off-season periods. The term is often used synonymously with deep cleaning. Spring cleaning may involve a complete overhaul of the rooms and is, therefore, scheduled for the off-season or very low-occupancy periods. Spring-cleaning involves many tasks on which the housekeeping department works in close coordination with the maintenance department.
<br>
<br>Intensive cleaning tasks may have to be carried out, for which an entire floor of rooms will have to be taken off sale at a time.
<br>
<br>● Spring-cleaning tasks may include the following:
<br>● Removal of all guest supplies, soft furnishing, and carpets from the rooms.
<br>● Sending launderable articles to the laundry.
<br>● Polishing wooden furniture, shampooing upholstery, and covering them with dust sheets.
<br>● Shampooing carpets.
<br>● Stripping and polishing floors.
<br>● Cleaning accessories such as lamps, lamp shades, and picture frames.
<br>● Stripping any wall covering such as paint or wallpaper and repainting the walls.
<br>● Washing ceilings and walls.
<br>● Thoroughly cleaning lighting fixtures, air-conditioning vents, and windows.
<br>● Thoroughly cleaning bathrooms, including walls, floor tiles, fixtures and fittings, and shower curtains.
<br>● Vacuum-cleaning the mattresses.
<br>● Airing the room.
<br>● Restocking guest supplies.
<br>● Restoring soft furnishing and carpets.
<br>● Clearing the rooms to the front desk for sale at the end of a thorough clean.
<br>
<br><strong>Cleaning Procedures/Cleaning Processes
</strong><br>Cleaning processes may be either mechanical or manual. They may involve washing, friction (as in using an abrasive), suction (as in using a vacuum cleaner), or force (as in using pressurized water).
<br>
<br>The various types of cleaning processes are summarized below:
<br>1. Manual Methods &amp; Mechanical Methods
<br>2. Manual Methods
<br>
<br>These do not call for mechanized or electronic equipment. These include:
<br>● Sweeping
<br>● Dusting
<br>● Damp-dusting
<br>● Dust-Mopping/Dry-Mopping/Mop-Sweeping
<br>● Spot Mopping
<br>● Wet-Mopping/Damp-Mopping
<br>● Spot Cleaning
<br>
<br><strong>Mechanized Methods
</strong><br>These utilize equipment powered by electricity as well as mechanical gadgets. These include:
<br>● Suction Cleaning
<br>● Spray Buffing
<br>● Polishing
<br>● Burnishing
<br>● Scrubbing
<br>
<br><strong>Design Features that simplify Cleaning
</strong><br>● Smooth textures; straight, neat, and smooth lines; and medium toned colours are some of the design features in a surface that make for easier cleaning.
<br>● Surfaces with these features collect less dust compared to surfaces with rough textures, intricate raised patterns, and grooves.
<br>● Medium-toned colours show less dirt than surfaces of darker or lighter shades.
<br>● Furniture should be so designed that cleaning under and behind them is easy.
<br>● Furniture on castor wheels and glides are easily movable, making cleaning under and behind them easier.
<br>● Bed frames should not have a raised edge. Though raised edges help to keep the mattress sunk in place, they may graze the hands of GRAs badly during bed-making.
<br>● With regard to carpets, the shorter the carpet pile, the easier the cleaning.
<br>● Upholstery too should have the minimum of decorative features such as buttons, gathers, etc.
<br>● Surfaces such as solid wood are now being substituted by laminates wherever possible.
<br>● While solid wood requires regular buffing and polishing, laminates are low-maintenance surfaces.
<br>● A regular damp-dusting is usually sufficient for laminates. The drawback of laminates is that they lack the richness and elegance of solid wood.
<br>● Wood-polishes are stain-resistant and long-lasting, and are a boon to housekeepers as wooden surfaces become fairly easy to maintain with the use of these polishes.
<br>● Another high-maintenance surface that requires constant polishing is brass.
<br>● Brass becomes easily tarnished, and more so in coastal climates.
<br>● Laminated brass surfaces are easier to maintain as they do not require regular polishing, and should be preferred in hotels.&nbsp;<br></p>
