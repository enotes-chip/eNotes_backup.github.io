                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>PERSONAL / KITCHEN HYGIENE
</strong><br>Most of the food-borne disease is caused by bacteria, spread by food workers or handlers. Hence the first step in preventing food-borne disease is good personal –hygiene. Food handler play an important role in ensuring food safety throughout the chain of production, processing, storage, and preparation. Mishandling and disregard of hygienic measures on their part may enable pathogens to come into contact with food and in some cases, to survive and multiply in sufficient numbers to cause illness in the customer on the consumer.
<br>As a food handler, one must ensure that the food provided to the consumer is free from all types of contamination.
<br><br>The ability of the food handler to ensure the wholesomeness of the food prepared and served will depend upon following a few basic rules of personal hygiene and good food handling. <strong><em>These rules can be divided into 3 groups.
</em></strong><br>
<br><strong>1. General personal hygiene:</strong> A hygienic appearance of professionals is indicated by high standards of personal cleanliness and is shown by the cleanliness of hair, hands, face, clothing, and shoes. Good personal hygiene helps prevent food-borne disease; therefore these points must be put into practice.
<br>● Shower or bath daily.
<br>● Wear clean clothes and a uniform.
<br>● Do not work if suffering from a communicable disease.
<br>● Handle food as little as possible.
<br>● Wash hands before and during work and every time after using the toilet.
<br>● Keep hair clean and do not handle them in the kitchen.
<br>● Do not touch nose &amp; mouth with hands.
<br>● Do not cough or sneeze over food, use a tissue.
<br>● Do not wear rings, earrings, jewelry &amp; watches.
<br>● Do not smoke in food preparation areas.
<br>● Taste food with a clean spoon.
<br>● Do not sit on a work surface.
<br>● Footwear should be clean, safe, and topped with steel toe.
<br>● Chef cap should always be worn when handling food.
<br>● Open cuts, burns, etc. Must be covered with a waterproof dressing.
<br>● Persons suffering from diarrhea, sore throat, vomiting, cold, etc. Must not handle food.
<br><br>If a person becomes aware that they are suffering from or are carriers of typhoid, paratyphoid, salmonella, or staphylococcal infection, the person responsible for the operation must be informed, who then must inform the medical officer of health.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Clean hands:</strong>&nbsp;The following actions require immediate hand washing before continuing work.
<br>● Contact with infected or otherwise unsanitary areas of the body.
<br>● Use of handkerchief or tissue.
<br>● Hand contact with unclean equipment and work, surfaces, soiled clothing, or cleaning towels.
<br>● Handling raw food, particularly meat, poultry, and fish items.
<br>● Cleaning away soiled dishes and utensils.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Procedure for Washing Hands 
</em></strong><br>• Wet your hands with hot running water. Use water as hot as you can comfortably stand, but at least 100°F (38°C). 
<br>• Apply enough soap to make a good lather. 
<br>• Rub hands together thoroughly for 20 seconds or longer, washing not only the hands but the wrists and the lower part of the forearms. 
<br>• Using a nail brush, clean beneath the fingernails and between the fingers. 
<br>• Rinse hands well under hot running water. If possible, use a clean paper towel to turn off the water to avoid contaminating the hands by contact with soiled faucets. 
<br>• Dry hands with clean single-use paper towels or a warm-air hand dryer
<br>
<br><strong>3. Food handling
</strong><br>
<br><strong><em>Hygiene In Handling Food
</em></strong><br>
<br><strong>1. DRY FOOD STORAGE:</strong> Avoid moisture, use an air-tight container, and avoid insect &amp; rodents.
<br>
<br><strong>2. FREEZER STORAGE:</strong> Well-packed food with label store at -18*c, follow FIFO &amp; thaw properly before use.
<br>
<br><strong>3. COLD ROOM STORAGE:</strong> cooked items away from the raw items. Store everything in a container. Chill food before refrigeration. Keep the temperature under 5*c.
<br>
<br><strong>4. HOT FOOD STORAGE:</strong> Do not reheat in a bain-marie. Cover all the food, keep food above 65*c.
<br>
<br><strong>5. FOOD HANDLING:
</strong><br>● Work with fresh &amp; safe food.
<br>● Use clean equipment &amp; work table.
<br>● Wash &amp; wipe tools( knives, chopping board, etc.) after every use.
<br>● Wash ingredients.
<br>● Reboil stocks, sauces, soups, milk before reuse.
<br>● Do not mix batches of cooked food.
<br>● Use separate tools for vegetables &amp; meats.
<br>● Use separate tools for raw &amp; cooked food.
<br>● Quickly chill all high-risk food for cold storage.
<br>● Keep work area clean.
<br>● FIFO( first in first out)
<br>
<br><strong>UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING
</strong><br>“More of protective clothing than uniform.” The chef’s uniform consists of the following:
<br>
<br><strong>Toque/Head-wear
</strong><br>• Keeps the head cool and prevents the hair from falling into the food.
<br>• Cotton/cloth caps are difficult to maintain whereas, paper caps are disposable hence they are neat.
<br>
<br><strong>Scarf/Neckerchief
</strong><br>• Absorbs sweat.
<br>• Identification/designation.
<br>
<br><strong>Double-breasted jacket
</strong><br>• Protects the chest and front.
<br>• Easy to remove overhead or sideways.
<br>• Cotton cloth buttons – heat resistant.
<br>
<br><strong>Apron
</strong><br>• Below-knee level.
<br>• Double protection prevents the jacket &amp; trousers from becoming dirty.
<br>
<br><strong>Cotton checked trousers
</strong><br>• Double shade hides the dirt.
<br>• Identifies designation.
<br>
<br><strong>Shoes and Socks
</strong><br>• Clogs can be used but it is expensive
<br>• Metal frame in front protects the toes.
<br>• Easy to remove legs.
<br>• Socks
<br>• Absorbs sweat.
<br>• Provides good grip.
<br>• Steady steps while walking
<br><br><br><strong>KNIVES
</strong><br>
<br><strong>KNIFE MATERIALS
</strong><br>The metal that a knife blade is made of is an important consideration, as the metal must be able to take and hold a very fine edge.
<br>
<br>1. Carbon steel was for many years the traditional favorite because it can be honed to an extremely sharp edge. Its disadvantages are that it corrodes and discolors easily, especially when used with acid foods and onions. Also, it discolors some foods(such as hard-cooked eggs) and may leave a metallic taste. Because of these disadvantages, it has given way to high-carbon stainless steel (described in item 3 below),which is now the preferred material for the best knives.
<br>
<br>2. Traditional stainless-steel alloys will not rust or corrode, but they are much harder to sharpen than carbon steel. Stainless steel is used mostly for low-cost, lightweight knives.
<br>
<br>3. High-carbon stainless steel is a relatively new alloy that combines the best aspects of carbon steel and stainless steel. It takes an edge almost as well as carbon steel, and it will not rust, corrode, or discolor. Knives made of this material are highly prized and relatively expensive.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>KNIFE AND ITS PARTS
</strong><br>The importance of knives to a chef cannot be overstated. It is the most important piece of equipment in the kitchen. Knives come in various shapes and sizes and each is meant for a specific use though some knives can be used as multi-purpose knives. Let us now familiarize ourselves with different parts of a knife.
<br>
<br><strong>Blade:</strong> The blade is usually made up of a metal compound called high carbon stainless steel. It combines the property of carbon being sharpened easily and non-corrosive properties of steel. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>The different parts of a blade are:
</em></strong><br>●&nbsp;<strong>Tip:</strong> The tip of the knife is the pointed edge where the knife blade ends. The tip generally is used for scoring patterns and working with meats or carving.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Spine:</strong> The spine of the knife is the topmost, thick edge of the knife, which gives strength to the knife.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Bolsters:</strong> In some knives there is a collar known as a bolster, at the point where the blade meets the handle. It reinforces the structure of a knife.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Cutting edge:</strong> The cutting edge is the most important part of the knife. It should always be kept honed and sharpened.
<br>●&nbsp;<strong>Handle: </strong>The handle of a knife should be easy to grip, non-reactive to most cleaning agents. The different materials used to make handles are wood, plastic, plastic fibre or even metal.
<br>·         <em>1. Tang: </em>The tang is the continuation of the blade and extends into a knife’s handle.
<br>·         <em>2. Rivets: </em>These are metal fasteners that hold the handle and the tang together.
