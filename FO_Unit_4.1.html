                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>NIGHT AUDIT
</strong><br>
<br>The hotel remains operational round the clock, 365 days a year, The guests Staying in a hotel include regular guests as well as occasional guests, and their duration of Slay may vary from a few hours to several weeks. A transaction, especially a financial one, should be reviewed on a daily basis, as
<br>guests might depart from the hotel anytime and it may be too late to recover an unpaid bill or a loss due to any mistake in the posting of changes in the guest account. In order to safeguard the interests of the hotel, a systematic examination of the financial transactions Of guests is carried out by competent people at the end of every day. 
<br>
<br><strong>NIGHT AUDIT
</strong><br>According to Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, audit is ‘an_ official examination of a business and financial records to see that they are true and correct’.
<br>The main purpose of night auditing is to keep a track of the total revenue generated during the day and to keep the guest accounts correct and up-to-date. This leads to customer satisfaction as the guests are given accurate and up-to-date bills at the time of check-out. The night auditor also verifies the entries posted in non-guest accounts, monitors guest credit limits, balances all accounts, and sorts out any discrepancies in room status.
<br>
<br><strong>NIGHT AUDITOR
</strong><br>A night auditor is a person who audits the hotel accounts daily at night or at a time when the business is relatively slow. The audit team generally comprises members of the accounts department. The number of people in the audit team depends upon the size, location, and products of the hotel. Since most of the activities of the night auditor are concentrated in the front office, the front office manager (FOM) may provide the necessary inputs for the night audit process. So the members of the
<br>night audit team generally report to the accounts department as well as the FOM. As a night auditor has to work in the night, the position doesn’t find many takers, so most of the hotels do not have a permanent team of night auditors.
<br>
<br><strong>Duties and Responsibilities of a Night Auditor
</strong><br>A night auditor performs the following duties and responsibilities:
<br>● Establishes the end of the day.
<br>● Ensures the accuracy of front office accounting records and balances them.
<br>● Reconciles all the financial transactions between a hotel and its guests.
<br>● Calculates the total revenue generated during the day.
<br>● Verifies and validates the cashier's posting of charges in the guest accounts.
<br>● Posts the room charges in the guest folio.
<br>● Transfers the unpaid guest accounts—i.e., accounts of guests who have left the hotel without settling their bills—to city ledger.
<br>● Monitors the house limit of guests.
<br>● Prepares a high balance report of guest accounts that are nearing or have crossed the house limit.
<br>● Monitors the current status of discounts, meal coupons, and other promotional
activities that are carried out by the front desk employees.
<br>● Prepares reports for the management.
<br>● Tracks the room occupancy percentage.
<br>
<br><strong>NIGHT AUDIT PROCESS
</strong><br>The night audit is conducted in every hotel to maintain an accurate and efficient accounting system that keeps proper records of all the transactions. This prevents the loss of revenue as well as leads to higher levels of guest satisfaction (as guests are presented error-free and up-to-date bills). The night audit is conducted on a daily basis as the creditors (hotel guests to whom the hotel extends credit facility) are mostly unknown and if their accounts remain unsettled due to some error in
<br>bookkeeping, the hotel will lose that revenue. The daily authentication of accounts, by verifying support documents and the posting of charges in the guest accounts, is necessary to prevent any possible loss of revenue. The steps that are commonly involved in night audit process are as under:
<br>● Establishing the end of the day.
<br>● Completing outstanding postings and verifying transactions.
<br>● Reconciling transactions in guest accounts, city accounts, and points of sale.
<br>● Verifying no-shows.
<br>● Preparing high balance reports and occupancy reports.
<br>● Updating the system.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Establishing the End of the Day</strong> 
<br>The end of the day is the arbitrary time that is supposed to be the end of the financial transactions for a particular day. As hotels remain operational round the clock, it is very necessary to ascertain the time that will be treated as the end of the day and the beginning of a new day in a hotel. This time is generally established by the night auditor. The time when the process of night auditing begins is usually taken to be the end of the day, which means that all transactions that take place after the commencement of the night audit are taken in the next day's business. For example, if a guest checks-in at 11:15 p.m. at a hotel where the night audit begins at 11 p.m. the guest’s account is included in the next day's business. 
<br>
<br><strong>Completing Outstanding Postings and Verifying Transactions 
</strong><br>Once the end of the day is established, the first step is to complete the posting of all pending charges (room and tax) in proper account folios. An efficient front office accounting system ensures the prompt posting of the financial transactions as they occur and reach the front desk cash and bills section. The transactions should appear in the guest folio in the order of their occurrence. Let's suppose the charges for a meal that was consumed on Monday are mistakenly posted by a front office cashier in the folio on Tuesday. This can confuse and lead to a problem during the settlement of the account as the guest may have visited some other food outlet on Tuesday. The night auditor posts all outstanding charges properly at the commencement of the night audit process. 
<br>
<br>The night auditor physically verifies all the financial transactions by cross-examining the account with supporting vouchers like credit vouchers, debit vouchers, visitors paid-out vouchers, allowance vouchers, etc. There might be errors in the posted charges, which should be caught by the night auditor. For example, the front office cashier might have incorrectly posted the room rent as $4,000 instead of Rs 4,000. This would have led to an inaccurate calculation of revenue that day. The night auditor should catch this mistake and correct it, saving the hotel from a lot of embarrassment and from the trouble of amending many records. The night auditors verify the postings in all accounts by going through all the documents carefully. They also validate the discounts given to guests. They 
<br>examine and authenticate all the transactions that involve monetary elements. 
<br>
<br><strong>Reconciling Transactions 
</strong><br>The next step is the reconciliation of each financial transaction with the original source documents (generally vouchers). The reconciliation of accounts may be carried out in the following sections: 
<br>● Guest accounts 
<br>● City accounts 
<br>● Points of sale 
<br>
<br><strong>Guest Accounts</strong> All the financial transactions that occur between a hotel and its guests are examined by the night audit team. The folio of each guest is matched with the original documents of transactions for the verification of the account. The night auditor also checks for any discrepancy in room status reports of the front office and housekeeping departments. For example, the housekeeping occupancy report may show 104 occupied rooms while the front office occupancy report shows 105 occupied rooms. There is a discrepancy of one room, which means that one room is shown as occupied, though it is ready and could have been sold. 
<br>The reconciliation of charges in guest accounts is done in the following order: 
<br>● Room charges 
<br>● Food and beverage charges 
<br>● Other charges 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Room charges</em></strong> The night auditor posts the room rent in the guest folio at the beginning of the night audit process. The basis of posting of the room charges may be as under, depending upon the house customs: 
<br>● Check-in/Check-out basis: It is generally followed in commercial hotels. The tariff cards of such hotels mention the check-in and check-out times (generally 12 noon). 
<br>● Twenty-four-hour basis: It is generally followed by transient hotels where the duration of guest slay is very short. At times it may range from two to four hours for guests who have to catch connecting flights. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Food and beverage charge</em></strong> The food and beverage charges posted in the guest folio by the front desk cashier are verified by the night auditor against the restaurant checks, which bear the guest’s signature as a token of the guest’s acceptance that the services were availed by her and that the amount is correct. Every such entry in the guest folio is reconciled by the night auditor. Complimentary kitchen order tickets (KOTs) are also verified and reconciled by the night auditor. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Other charges</em></strong> The night auditor also reconciles other financial transactions that take place between the hotel and its guests. Transactions like visitors paid-out, miscellaneous expenses, discounts, etc. are verified by night auditors. 
<br>
<br><strong>City Accounts </strong>Night auditors also examine the entries in non-resident guest accounts or city accounts. They check these accounts for completeness and accuracy. If any instance of the high outstanding balance is found during the night audit process, the night auditors prepare the report of high balance, which is presented to the management, and the responsibility of collecting payment (part/full) shifts to the accounts department. 
<br>
<br><strong>Points of Sale</strong> The cashiers of all the points of sale (POS) prepare a summary sheet of financial transactions that occur at their POS and keep the same in an envelope, along with the second copy of bills. The same envelope, along with the cash and credit transactions, is generally deposited with the cashier at the front desk cash and bills section. The night auditor pulls out all the checks/vouchers( including void checks, paid-outs, allowances, foreign exchange transactions, miscellaneous charge vouchers, etc) of individual POS and reconciles them with the POS cashiers’ sales summary sheets. 
<br>
<br><strong>Verifying No-shows 
</strong><br>The night auditor also verifies no shows. Ano show is siltation when a guest with a confirmed reservation does not arrive at the hotel on the date of arrival without any prior intimation about the cancellation. The night auditor verifies all such no shows, and in the case of guaranteed reservations, posts the no show in the guest folios. Usually, hotels charge one nights retention for no shows. The night auditor should verify carefully that the reservation was guaranteed, that guest has not 
<br>registered, and that it was not a duplicate reservation, For example, if there is a no show in the name of John Adam, and a guest called Adam Johns has registered at the hotel, it should be checked if the two are the same. 
<br>
<br><strong>Preparing Reports 
</strong><br>The next step in the night audit process is to prepare daily reports for managerial use, which help the management to review the profitability of the hotel operations and plan future goals. In manual systems, this is one of the typical tasks carried out by the night auditor. In fully automated hotels, these reports are automatically prepared by the system. The night auditor generally prepares the following reports for the management: 
<br>
<br>● High balance report 
<br>● Occupancy reports 
<br>
<br>High Balance Report A night auditor monitors the credit limit of individual resident guest accounts as well as city accounts. The formula to calculate the outstanding balance is: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Outstanding balance = Previous balance + Debit entries (purchases) — Credit entries (payments) 
</em></strong><br>
<br>The credit limit of a guest account depends upon the credibility of the guest and the floor limit of the guest’s credit card. The night auditor checks every account against the relevant credit limit of that account. A high balance report is made in case the account balance reaches or crosses the house limit. For example, the house limit might be Rs 10,000 and the guest might have paid Rs 7,000 earlier, but the total bill after room rent and meals for four days is coming to Rs 18,500, ie., the outstanding is Rs 9,500, The night auditor generates a high balance report that indicates the guest account has crossed the house limit. On receiving this report, the management may seek a partial or full settlement of the outstanding balance before the guest can avail of further credit facility from the hotel. This protects the hotel from the loss of revenue in case the guest leaves without settling her bills. 
<br>
<br>Occupancy Reports The night auditor also generates the following occupancy-related reports: 
<br>
<br>● Occupancy percentage 
<br>● House count 
<br>● Bed occupancy percentage 
<br>● Domestic occupancy percentage 
<br>● Foreigner’s occupancy percentage 
<br>
<br><strong>Occupancy percentage </strong>The occupancy percentage is the ratio of the number of rooms sold to the total number of saleable rooms. It determines the level of revenue that will be generated by the hotel and is an indicator of the performance of the hotel. 
<br>The formula to calculate occupancy percentage is as under: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Occupancy percentage</em></strong> = Number of rooms sold / Total number of saleable rooms X 100
<br>
<br><strong>House count</strong> The house count is the total number of resident guests present in the hotel. i.e.. the total number of rooms sold. It is used to determine the average room rate per person. The formula to calculate the house count is as under: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>House count</em></strong> = House count of previous day brought forward - Today's departures + Today’s arrivals 
<br>
<br><strong>Bed occupancy percentage</strong> It is the ratio of the number of beds occupied to the total number of available beds in the property. The formula to calculate bed occupancy percentage is as under: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Bed occupancy percentage</em></strong> = Number of beds occupied / Total no. of beds available for guest  X 100
<br>
<br><strong>Domestic occupancy percentage</strong> It is the ratio of the total number of domestic guests to the house count. This is the indicator of the type of clients visiting the hotel. The formula to calculate domestic occupancy percentage is as under: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Domestic occupancy percentage </em></strong>= Total number of domestic guests / House count X 100
<br>
<br><strong>Foreigner’s occupancy percentage</strong> It is the ratio of the total number of foreign nationals to the house count. This is an indicator of the type of clients visiting the property. The formula to calculate foreigners’ occupancy percentage is as under: 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Foreigner’s occupancy percentage </em></strong>= Total number of foreign guests / House count X 100
<br>
<br><br><strong>Updating the System </strong><br>Once the outstanding charges have been posted and reconciled, no-shows have been verified, and reports and summaries for the management have been prepared, the night auditor updates the system and ends the night audit process. In fully automated hotels, the computerized system automatically carries out system updates. 
<br>Thus, a night auditor establishes the end of the day, takes stock, checks if charges have been posted properly, and reconciles all the financial transactions of the day between a hotel and its guests. The night auditor is also known as the in-house auditor who is responsible for conducting audits and generating reports for the management, which include the high balance report and occupancy percentage reports like house count, bed occupancy percentage, domestic occupancy percentage, and foreigners’ occupancy percentage. The job of a night auditor is a very responsible position and requires basic accounting skills, and computer and hotel management knowledge and background.&nbsp;<br></p>
