<br>
<br><strong>Cooperation With F &amp; B Service</strong> 
<br>• There should be a close liaison between f &amp; b service and the kitchen staff because f &amp; b personnel are involved in the selling of the products made by the kitchen department. 
<br>• It is the duty of the f &amp; b personnel to give the intimation about the various parties to be hosted in future and in turn it is the duty of the kitchen people to provide food at the right time in hygiene condition. 
<br>• Also, f &amp; b personnel must be aware as to how much time a dish requires to get ready because they are the ones who are directly associated with the guests. 
<br>
<br><strong>Cooperation With Maintenance
