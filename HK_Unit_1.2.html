<br> 
<br>
<br><strong> FLOOR PANTRY/MAID’S SERVICE ROOM
</strong><br>
<br>Though not attached to the department physically, floor pantries are very much a part of housekeeping department. These are located on each guest floor to keep a stock of linen, guest supplies, and maid’s cart and cleaning supplies for that particular floor. A floor pantry stores a complete set of linen for the whole floor over and above what is already in circulation in the rooms. 
<br>
<br>The floor pantries are away from guest’s view and should be situated  near the service elevators. It should store all housekeeping items so that the housekeeping staff does not have to keep going back to the housekeeping department or linen room for any item. Since the floor pantry is used to stock expensive items such as linen, it should remain locked at all times when not in use. The key to the floor pantry is kept by the GRA of that floor and a duplicate is kept with the floor supervisor. 
<br>
<br>The following should be provided in a floor pantry:
<br>
<br>• Cupboards to store guest supplies, cleaning agents and equipment.
<br>
<br>• Shelves and racks to store fresh room linen.
<br>
<br>• Linen trolleys to store fresh and soiled linen and for transporting/dispatching the same to the linen and uniform room.
<br>
<br>• A notice board to display information regarding expected arrivals, VIPs in the house, extra bed, and guest loan items given to guests.
<br>
<br>• A sink with hot and cold water facilities to wash or disinfect glasses, fill drinking water in flasks, and for flower arrangements.
<br>
<br>• Guest loan items such as roll away beds, cribs, and bed boards.
<br>
<br>• It should have shelves and cupboards for linen and supplies, and
<br>
<br>sufficient area to park a room maid’s cart.
<br>
<br>• It should have a sink with water supply.
