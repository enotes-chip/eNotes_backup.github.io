                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>INTRODUCTION
</strong><br>While selecting a location for starting a catering the establishment, the proprietor usually considers the following:
<br>1. The cost of land and construction of building, or the rent which will have to&nbsp; be paid for a ready site
<br>2. overhead costs incurred
<br>3. equipment, fittings, fixtures and furnishings required
<br>4. number and type of potential customers
<br>
<br>Apart from these considerations, it is necessary to give a careful thought to the hygiene aspect. This is crucial for the business to run successfully, otherwise a large portion of Money would be spent on trying to maintain hygienic standards in the establishment.
<br>
<br>Some of the important aspects which should not be neglected are listed below.
<br>
<br><strong><em>1. Air:</em></strong> The surrounding atmosphere should be free from pollutants like smoke, dust and fumes.
<br><strong><em>2. Vicinity: </em></strong>The Area around the establishment should be clean. Garbage dumps and stagnant water in the vicinity encourage breeding of rodents, flies and mosquitoes.
<br><strong><em>3. Water supply: </em></strong>An adequate supply of potable water should be available round the clock and the premises should have sufficient storage tanks, wash basins and sanitary conveniences which are suitably located. Proper sewage disposal facilities should be available.
<br><strong><em>4. Lighting and ventilation:</em></strong> Natural light and ventilation is preferred in the premises. Dark and dingy rooms and passages should be avoided. Basement kitchens need special lighting and ventilation.
Careful consideration while planning windows and drains is necessary to prevent contamination of food.
<br><strong><em>5. Space:
</em></strong><br>(a) In the kitchen: The work area should be large enough to&nbsp; ensure Safety at work
<br>1. provide convenience and comfort to the workers
<br>2. Prevent Overcrowding
<br>3. avoid criss-crossing of traffic lines
<br>4. Prevent queue at sinks and wash basins
<br>5. reduce unnecessary walking
<br>6. ensure adequate work tables and storage space
<br>7. keep cooked and raw food apart.
<br>
<br>If the work area is not well planned, the employee may tend to overlook hygienic practices while handling food. A poorly set up establishment leads to wastage of time and energy, frustrations and difficulties, and increases the likelihood of accidents. In short, it affects the overall work achieved in terms of quality and quantity.
<br>
<br>The kitchen and dish-washing area should generally be approximately half the size of the service area. Each worker requires 3m2 (33 sq ft) of floor area to enable him to work comfortably. The minimum size of the kitchen should be 9.3m2 (100 sq ft) and ceiling should be at a minimum height of 2.5m (8 ft).
<br>
<br>(b) In the service area:
<br>1. Tables and chairs should be well spaced with no overcrowding
<br>2. Waiters should be able to serve all customers, and clear and clean all tables comfortable. For a restaurant having a capacity of fifty covers, the space required is 1.4m2 (15sq ft) per cover.
<br>
<br><strong>LAYOUT AND PREMISES
</strong><br>
<br>A well planned and designed food service area is a prerequisite for maintaining high standards of&nbsp; sanitation. Premises should be planned to facilitate cleaning and all equipment should be designed and arranged to prevent accumulation of soil and contamination of food.&nbsp; An ideal situation would be one where things move forward in orderly progression, beginning from receiving food in the stores to preparation, service and cleaning up. If food has to move through a shorter distance and if it is handled less, the chances of it getting contaminated will be greatly reduced.
<br>While planning the layout it is necessary to understand the purpose of every piece of equipment&nbsp; and every room and avoid wastage of money and space by building unnecessary corridors or rooms of inappropriate sizes.
<br>
<br><strong>The Receiving Area</strong>
<br>The receiving area is located near the stores. The stores should be so located that food is brought
<br>in by the shortest route. This entrance is separate from the customers entrance and opens into a cemented yard. Adequate space should be provided for delivery vans to stop in front of the door&nbsp;and deliver goods at the doorstep. The gas bank and garbage bins should be located in the yard.
<br>
<br><strong>The Storage Area
</strong><br>This includes the dry food store, the cold store and the frozen stores. All these areas are located near the receiving entrance. Each area should have a sink, a drain and a garbage bin.
<br>
<br><strong>The Kitchen
</strong><br>The kitchen is divided into two areas -  the hot kitchen and the cold kitchen. The kitchen is accessible only to kitchen employees and should not be used as a thoroughfare or a shortcut to reach other parts of the building. Depending on the size and type of establishment, the kitchen may be divided into separate rooms for separate activities or all sections may be included in one large room and different areas demarcated for different activities. The main point to be kept in mind here is that the flow of work should not be hampered.
<br>
<br><strong><em>While planning the kitchen layout begin with listing down the following:
</em></strong><br>1. different sections which are to be included
<br>2. nature of work done in these sections
<br>3. equipment which is to be installed
<br>4. natural ventilation and lighting available
<br>5. water supply
<br>6. location of sinks and drains
<br>7. furniture and fixtures needed
<br>
<br>The kind and volume of equipment, furniture and fixtures required will depend on the type of establishment, volume of business and space available. If space is a constraint, it is advisable to utilize wall space. Built-in cupboards, fixed racks and shelves as well as folding or collapsible furniture do not use up floor space. All fixed equipment and shelves should be easy to clean. Other equipment should be arranged so that there is sufficient area for routine cleaning.
<br>Cooking ranges can be placed in the center of the room, away from doors, to keep dust and air droughts away. They should have a canopy or hood and an exhaust fan to remove fumes and odour from the kitchen.
<br>Sinks should be placed against the external wall, closest to the drain. Each worktable should ideally have a removable garbage bin fitted on a trolley placed under the table. All work tables should be movable and easy to clean.
<br>The rice boiler and potato peeler should be located near a drain. It should be fitted with a strainer and a trap for catching the wastes. The dry preparation zone of the kitchen should have running
hot and cold water sinks.
<br>Sufficient storage space should be provided for other small equipment when not in use. Pots and&nbsp; pans should be stored upside down on racks or slatted shelves, Pots and pans with long handles
should be stored on hooks. No utensils or food should be placed on the floor.
<br>The refrigerator should be located in a cool place, as far as possible from any source of heat. Every Kitchen should have freezer, chiller and cooling store facilities, even if all three are in the same unit.
<br><br><strong><em>Washing Up</em></strong> A separate washing up area should be available for (i) pots and pans, and should be&nbsp; located near the preparation area, and (ii) crockery and cutlery and should be near the pantry.
The wash up area should not be located near food preparation and storage areas. Sinks used for&nbsp; washing pots, pans and crockery should not be used for handwashing or washing foodstuff.
<br>Washed and dried dishes should be stored in clean, dry cupboards located near both the kitchen&nbsp;and service area.
The crockery store should be protected from pests and dust. Plates can be stacked on drying
racks and cups can be stored bottom upwards in wiretrays. Cutlery is stored in partitioned drawers
or in partitioned covered boxes or trays.
The service linen cupboard should be closer to the dining area. The pantry should be located between the kitchen and dining area and should allow the forward flow of food from the kitchen to the restaurant or dining area. The restaurant should have two doors—one leading in from the pantry
and one leading to the wash-up area.
<br>
<br><strong>Staff Rooms</strong>
<br>Changing rooms equipped with lockers should be provided for all employees. Lockers should
be large enough to accommodate hangers. Protective clothes and outdoor clothes should be kept
separately. The use of the kitchen as a changing room or staff room should be discouraged. Clothes
hanging or drying in the food preparation area is not only unsightly but unhygienic as well. The changing rooms should have good washing facilities. A linen basket must be provided for dirty linen. Laundering, repair and replacement of worn out protective clothing is the responsibility of the management.
<br>
<br><strong>Sanitary Accommodation
</strong><br>Facilities should be adequate, convenient, hygienic and well-stocked. Separate sanitary accommodation is necessary for employees and customers and should be readily accessible at a distance of 3m. These rooms should be well equipped. Separate rooms should be provided for males and females and labeled accordingly. Sanitary towel disposers or bins should be fitted in the ladies toilets with instructions for use clearly mentioned, or they should be disposed of by wrapping in disposable bags and discarding in a covered bin.
<br>
<br>Toilets should be well lit and properly ventilated. They should not open directly into the food area. A well-ventilated corridor or space between the toilet and food preparation area or service area is a desirable feature. Adequate toilets and washbasins should be provided. Washbasins should be made of porcelain or stainless steel and should be used for handwashing only. A continuous supply of hot and cold water should be ideally available at each washbasin. Soap should be kept in a suitable container. Each basin should have a foot-operated bin for disposal of towels, etc. Alternatively, a warm air dryer can be provided. They are the most hygienic way of drying hands. Instructions for operating the hand dryer should be displayed near the machine.
<br><br><strong>BUILDING INTERIORS
</strong><br>Sanitation should be kept in mind right from the time when the building plan is being prepared.
As far as possible built-in sanitation should be looked for in the construction design at well as 2&nbsp; every piece of equipment, fittings, fixtures and utilities.&nbsp;Apart from good appearance, the clean ability, life and maintenance required are important: factors that have to be considered. <em>Before selecting any material, the manager should review the following points.
<br></em>
<br>1. Is the surface smooth or will it harbour dust, dirt and pests?
<br>2. Can soil be washed off easily?
<br>3. Will it withstand regular cleaning and use?
<br>4. How long will it be of service or will it need frequent maintenance and replacement?
<br>5. Can the surface finish be changed?
<br>
<br>If all the above points are not thought about while selecting material for walls, ceilings and floors, the food service manager will be faced with a difficult and expensive task in maintaining a high level of sanitation desirable in the establishment.
<br>
<br>Interiors chosen only on the basis of appearance and which are difficult to clean will low good for a short while only. Once soiled, they will look much worse. Grease, dust, betel-nut stains, food stains and cobwebs are often seen on floors, walls and ceilings, and if this is not completely removed the place will have a permanently dirty look.
<br>
<br><strong>Floors
</strong><br>The floors in work areas of catering establishments should be made of durable material because of the following reasons:
<br>
<br>1. they have to withstand heavy traffic.
<br>2. equipment used is heavy-duty equipment which weighs a lot.
<br>3. they are exposed to high temperatures.
<br>4. water and grease are likely to spill on floors.
<br>5. frequent cleaning is necessary.
<br>
<br>The floors should be sturdy, easy to clean and resistant to the effect of hot water, sanitizers and detergents. They should be non-absorbent, grease-resistant, dirt resistant, smooth, sealed and pest resistant. They should also be non-slippery and impervious. In areas where floors have to be washed regularly, like walk-in refrigerators, a drainage system and slope should be provided. Floors should be self-draining. All drains should have a perforated removable metal cover and should be tiled underneath. Any spillage should be mopped up immediately to prevent falls.
<br>
<br>Floors can be made from a variety of materials which may be natural or manmade. The manager&nbsp; should choose flooring on the basis of its quality and the budget available. Natural materials include a wide selection of quarry tiles such as Shahbad, Kota, Kadappa; marble: wood; concrete: granite; mosaic and ceramic.
Man-made materials include linoleum, vinyl) asbestos, rubber and cork.
<br>On the whole, flooring should offer complete unbroken surfaces. If jointed, the joints or grouts should be carefully made and well sealed.
Easily cleanable carpeting is also permissible in restaurants. Carpeting should be properly installed and only used in areas where no food or beverage preparation takes place. They create warmth, deaden sound and provide safety from falls and breakages as long as they are well installed, Carpets are made of wool, nylon, polyester, olefin and jute. They should be vacuum cleaned daily and shampooed regularly to remove food spillages, dirt and dust. If cleaning is a problem, granite can be used in restaurants. Although the initial cost is high it requires little maintenance and looks beautiful.
<br>
<br>Mats and duckboards should be used on slippery floors. They should be easy to remove and clean. Areas that obstruct routine cleaning - like flooring behind fixed equipment, below tables and racks, at the junction of the floor and wall - need extra attention.
<br>
<br><strong>Walls
</strong><br>
<br>Walls should be smooth, durable, impervious, washable and light in colour. They should be rounded
at junctions with floors and ceilings. They should be in good repair to prevent the accumulation of dust, dirt and vermin and to make cleaning easy. All cracks and crevices should be sealed to prevent pests from entering and multiplying.
<br>The best finish for walls in the kitchen and wash up area is ceramic tiles. If only the lower part of the wall is tiled, then it should extend till a height of 1.8 m (6 feet). Walls that are not tiled should be plastered.
<br>
<br><strong>Types of Wall Finishes
</strong><br><strong><em>1. Dry distemper or coloured lime-washed walls</em></strong> They will not stand frequent cleaning. Washable oil- bound distemper can stand regular washing but might pose a problem while removing absorbed grease. Grease marks can be rubbed off with the help of turpentine. Non-washable distemper rubs off easily and is not suitable for walls in a catering establishment.
<br><strong><em>2. Emulsion paints Emulsion paints</em></strong> can be used over dis-tempered surfaces but they cannot be applied directly over gloss finished surfaces. These surfaces have to be roughened by rubbing down with sand or glass paper. A plastic finish can be applied directly over concrete, brickwork, wood, stone or galvanized iron. It can also be directly applied over painted or dis-tempered surfaces. The advantage of plastic paint is that it does not crack or discolour and can withstand water and repeated scrubbing with acidic and alkaline cleaning agents. Other varieties of paints available for use are PVC, acrylic, enamel, epoxy and rubber paint. Textured paint finishes are not recommended. Lead-based paints are not suitable in food service areas as accidental flaking or chipping can cause food poisoning.
<br><strong><em>3. Wall pape</em></strong>r It is not suitable for the kitchen where food is prepared as it tends to peel off with the
<br>high heat and humidity. Plastic coated papers can be used in dry areas. Paint should be used for the walls of the dry food store as it is easy to clean.
<br><strong><em>4. Splash plates, tiles and panels Walls</em></strong> behind cooking ranges, ovens and grills can spoil because of&nbsp;excessive heat, grease and steam of normal working. Walls in the kitchen, especially those near the
sink and cooking equipment, should be able to withstand moisture, high temperature and physical
damage. Splash plates or tiled surfaces should be provided near the equipment on the wall. Ceramic
tiles should be evenly fitted and should have smooth, waterproof and continuous grouting. Stainless steel is more durable than tiles and is a better option in areas where wear and tear are high.
<br><strong><em>5. Plastic tiles</em></strong> may be used in cool places but they are likely to lose their glossy surface even under
light abrasive cleaning.
<br><strong><em>6. Glass panels</em></strong> are suitable for wall areas likely to become dirty and those that need frequent cleaning.
<br><br>The ability to get cleaned is thus an important criterion in selecting wall finishes. Walls should help in noise reduction by absorbing sound. Light-colored walls show up dirt and improve the distribution of light, which is why they are preferred.
<br>
<br><strong>Ceilings
</strong><br>All ceilings should be free from cobwebs, cracks and flaking. They should not harbour dirt, should be easily cleanable and should absorb moisture, especially in wet preparation areas. Suitable ceilings can be made of plaster with a smooth continuous lower surface. Insulation material like glass wool or fiberglass should be used in areas where a large amount of steam is generated. In such cases, ceilings should be finished with hard gloss paint. If ceilings are not insulated, the absorbent material used may be plaster, which can be finished with a soft non-washable distemper.
<br>These surfaces should be renewed every six months. Absorbent surfaces will prevent steam from
condensing on the surface and falling back onto food. A high gloss will wear well and light colour will promote good hygiene. All other fittings at ceiling level, like lights, fans, vents and hoods, should be properly fixed leaving no space for dirt to accumulate or pests to breed. They should be easy to clean and well maintained. The ceiling should be free from unnecessary decorations which makes cleaning difficult.
<br>
<br><strong>Doors
</strong><br>The kitchen, dining area and pantry should preferably have separate ‘in’ and ‘out’ doors. All doors should be rodentproof and self-closing. Full swing doors should have a transparent wired glass panel at eye level or should be strictly used for one-way traffic to prevent collisions. Simplicity in
<br>design, easy cleanability and well-fitted joints are some desirable features for all doors, They should be fitted with a metal kick plate or easily cleanable finger plate. Sliding-door railings should be kept clean.
<br>
<br><strong>Windows
</strong><br>Windows should be fly-proof. They should be so planned that there are adequate ventilation and light. Window sills should be waterproof.
<br>
<br><strong>Staircases and Service Lifts
</strong><br>Staircases should have banister posts and rails of simple design, which are easy to maintain and
kept in good repair.
<br>Service lifts should be cleaned every day and the entire lift should be cleaned thoroughly once
a week, taking care to remove food particles and spilled liquids that would otherwise attract pests. The insides of the lift should be made of non-absorbent materials. Spillages, if any, should be mopped up immediately. The lift should be used only for sending cooked food from the kitchen and not for preparing or storing food. Each course should be placed in a separate horizontal compartment with liquids in the lower compartment.
Large food lifts are needed when the kitchen is not on the ground floor the lift should not be used for carrying food and refuse at the same time. If food lift have to be used for poop or other goods also, then care should be taken to cover the food or carry it in closed container: Lifts ase for conveying, food and refuse should be kept very clean.
<br>
<br><strong>VENTILATION
</strong><br>Ventilation is the science of maintaining atmospheric conditions which are comfortable and healthful to the human body.
<br>
<br>Adequate ventilation is essential in every room, especially me the Kitchen because of a quantity of food production many high-pressure burners are used resulting in higher temperatures and large amounts of steam, fumes and smoke.<br><strong><br></strong><strong>Ventilation helps in the following ways:
</strong><br>
<br>1. it makes the workplace comfortable by cooling it
<br>2. it reduces the chances of accidental fires due to accumulated grease.
<br>3. it prevents water of condensation from settling on walls and ceilings and dripping onto food.
<br>4. it keeps the work area clean,
<br>5. it prevents toxic fumes and gases from accumulating in the kitchen,
<br>
<br>To maintain such conditions it is necessary to control the temperature, humidity, air currents and purity of air in the building as well as the surroundings. Foul air should be continuously removed and replaced by fresh air so that the environment is comfortable and free from health hazards.
<br>
<br><strong>Faulty Ventilation
</strong><br>In overcrowded and poorly ventilated rooms, the air gets polluted because of
<br>1. an increase in the level of carbon dioxide
<br>2. increased relative humidity
<br>3. rise in temperature
<br>4. air-borne ineffective agents and other air pollutants like smoke
<br>5. air remaining stagnant
<br>
<br>The discomfort is felt not only because of an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide, but mainly because of stagnant air, heat, and humidity. As air loses its cooling power fess heat is lost from the surface of the body, in a poorly ventilated, hot, stuffy, steamy kitchen atmosphere, the following symptoms may be observed in employees; headache, irritability, lassitude, poor concentration, drowsiness, loss of appetite, lowered resistance to respiratory tract infections and increased chances of accidents.
<br>
<br>An ill-ventilated workplace not only affects the health and work efficiency of the worker but also promotes the multiplication of harmful microorganisms in food, leading to food spoilage and food poisoning.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Volatile Organic Compounds</em></strong> A group of hazardous chemicals that emanate from solvents.
varnishes, paints, LPG stoves, pesticides, air fresheners, Incense sticks and newly renovated buildings
and include chemicals such as benzene, toluene, ethylene, xylene, carbon tetrachloride, etc.
<br>VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) are a cause of concern in the indoor air in poorly ventilated rooms, VOCs generally detected in indoor air belong to nine groups of compounds, most of which are used as solvents.
<br>
<br><strong>Sources of VOC Indoors
</strong><br>Benzene and Toluene from LPG stoves and cleansing solvents used in the kitchen and dining area. VOCs are present in thinners and solvents in paints, carpet cleaning solutions, lacquers and varnishes, mothballs and air fresheners, Indoor concentration of benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene is highest in shopping malls and second highest in restaurants.
<br>Newly painted walls, new floor coverings and newly renovated buildings can emit VOCs for
up to a few months, Photocopier machines, toner powder, laser printers, matrix printers, mosquito coil smoke, tobacco smoke incense sticks insecticides, dry cleaning, the concentration of xylene is
highest in offices.
<br>Outdoor sources of VOC's are automobile exhaust and traffic-related sources like garages, apart from industrial machinery in which hydrocarbons are incompletely burnt. They enter the building and add to the VOC content in the air.
<br>Because of a complex mix of health-damaging pollutants that arise indoors and are trigger off by&nbsp;poor ventilation, it is necessary to understand the sources of these VOCs and their effect on health
and work efficiency.
<br>
<br><em>The indoor VOC concentration can be controlled by the following measures:
</em><br>
<br>1. Use of exhaust ventilation for high VOC sources.
<br>2. Use of low emitting materials to finish and furnish interiors.
<br>3. Use of low emitting cleaning products.
<br>4. Limiting the usage of products that contain chemicals that are highly reactive to ozone.
<br>
<br>Thus, adequate ventilation is a must in each room and all areas in the catering establishment.
<br>
<br><strong>Systems of Ventilation
</strong><br>There are two systems of ventilation ~ natural and artificial. Artificial ventilation includes exhaust or extraction systems, propulsion systems, and air conditioning systems.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Natural Ventilation</em></strong> Natural ventilation is achieved by diffusion of gases and by the effect of differences in temperature by which hot air expands, becomes lighter and rises up and is replaced by cold air and the action of wind currents.
<br>
<br>Windows, doors and ventilators provide natural ventilation. Windows should be wire meshed to keep insects, dust and dirt away. The wire mesh should be regularly cleaned. The location of the windows in relation to the work areas is an important factor that needs careful consideration. Windows provide good natural ventilation when the weather is suitable. It is unbearable in extremely cold weather, ineffective by itself in very hot weather and unmanageable in very windy weather.
<br>
<br>Natural ventilation is rarely satisfactory by itself for public places where there are a large number of people gathered or where many cooking ranges are being used. It is effective only when there is sufficient open space around the establishment and a large number of windows opening directly into the open, and not in the heart of crowded cities.
Natural ventilation is effective when the kitchen is located above the ground floor. However, in basement and ground floor kitchens, artificial ventilation is desirable. Louvers or air bricks are more suitable than windows in basement and ground floor kitchens, Ventilators are useful where the ceilings ate high, Such rooms are easier to ventilate than rooms with low ceilings.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Disadvantages
</em></strong><br>1. Windows cannot be used for ventilation in certain types of weather, for example, in extreme cold, rainy, windy, or stormy weather.
<br>2. It may be impossible to position and arrange equipment so that windows can be used for ventilation unless specifically planned.
<br>3 Open windows used for ventilation allow dust, dirt, flies and other pests into the kitchen.
<br>4. No form of natural ventilation can keep out bad odours and fumes from the external environment.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Advantages
</em></strong><br>1. Itis cheap.
<br>2. If windows and doors are placed opposite one another at the same height for cross- ventilation, it can be quite efficient.
<br>3. It provides light during the daytime.
<br>
<br>Ceiling fans, table fans and exhaust fans are extremely useful in hot, humid, close kitchens. Fans help agitate the air, cause evaporation and make one feel comfortable. They help circulate the air by forcing the foul air out. They are useful where humidity is high and the air is still. However, ceiling fans and table fans cannot be used when the gas burners are on.
<br>
<br><strong>Artificial Ventilation</strong> This has to be resorted to where natural ventilation is not practical or where climatic conditions do not permit free use of open doors and windows and a large number of
people work for a considerably long period. In such cases, mechanical means are used to facilitate renewal of air. They can be regulated according to the needs.
<br>Ideally, ventilation of the kitchen should be separate from the rest of the building. The simplest form&nbsp;of artificial ventilation consists of an injector fan fitted with a filter that allows pure air to enter and an extractor fan at the other end of the room. The fans may be thermostatically controlled. The vent
outlets should be as high as possible on the walls. The inlet should not be near the refuse dump, sanitary conveniences, coal chute or any dirty or dusty place. The vent outlets should not create a nuisance for other people. The vent pipe should be fixed away from the wail, so that cleaning is made easy.
<br>Adequate artificial ventilation can be achieved by one of the following ways:
<br>
<br><strong><em>Exhaust or extraction system</em></strong> This method is based on mechanical suction or extraction of air out of rooms by creating a vacuum.
<br>It is used to carry fumes away from the workplace by exhaust fans which are either high-pressure fans or low-pressure fans. This system is popular in the tandoori and barbecue sections of Indian kitchens.
<br>Exhausts may be general or local.
<br><em>1. General exhaust: </em>It is recommended only for small operations involving little cooking. An exhaust fan is fitted in the wall to draw out foul air.
<br><em>2. Local exhaust</em> is done with exhaust hoods or ventilators. They are of two types:
<br>(a) Conventional hood which hangs at a height of 1.2 m (four feet) over the cooking range and is used for one or more units. This hood is fitted with an exhaust fan.
<br>(b) Ventilator hood which is usually attached to the unit and is used for that unit only.
<br>
<br>Each piece of cooking equipment Should be Provided with adequate ventilation, in the form of suspended hoods, screens and ducts.<br>Ventilation hoods should be designed of hard smooth material like steel or galvanized iron or any metal which will not corrode or rust. It should prevent liquid or grease from collecting and dropping back onto food or food contact surfaces. The hoods should be easy to clean. The size of the hood will depend on the size of the equipment. <br><br>The air ducts should be large enough to allow air to pass freely. It should be placed at a height of
1.2m (four feet) above the cooking surface. The hoods should be fitted with filters or grease extractors that are detachable. They should be cleaned regularly and inspected every three months. Special attention should be given to canopies over frying and grilling sections, where a lot of grease gets trapped. These filters should be cleaned or renewed at smaller intervals say, fortnightly to prevent fires After trapping the grease, the duct carries foul air to the exterior of the building.
<br>In this system, a vacuum is created and air that has been removed should be replaced without creating a draught All incoming air must be screened to prevent insects and dirt from entering the premises.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Disadvantages
</em></strong><br>1. Extraction of air from all rooms not uniform. 
<br>2. Although suitable inlets are provided, It’s very difficult to regulate incoming air.
<br>3. Air may be sucked in through undesirable places such as toilets, etc.
<br>4. Heating and cooling of the incoming air are not possible.
<br>
<br>In many areas in the United States, clean air ordinances demand that exhausted a with high levels of smoke, grease and food odor should be purified before its released.&nbsp; <br><em>Propulsion system Ventilation </em>is achieved by propelling or forcing, clean air into a room by using revolving fans or blowers under pressure.
The air which is forced in is washed, filtered, warmed or cooled and humidified. The air, however,
loses its freshness because it is treated. The inlets are installed at low levels near the floor, All doors and windows are kept closed. This system is not suitable for kitchens as undesirable fumes, steam and smoke are not removed. It can be used in restaurants and other public areas.

<br><em>Air conditioning or combined system</em> This is a combination of exhaust or extraction and propulsion system and it is the most satisfactory method of artificial ventilation. This principle is made use of in air conditioners where air, under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, is driven into the room by means of a fan through duets at a height of about 2m (seven ft.) from the floor,
<br>
<br>Used air is extracted from the room through an outlet at the floor level. If this system has to work effectively, there should be no leakage of air through doors and windows. The temperature of air should be 21°C (70°F) and humidity should be 60 percent in tropical countries. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Advantages of artificial ventilation</em></strong> 
<br>1. Air can be filtered, humified, warmed, or cooled before it is allowed to enter the building. 
<br>2. Air can be delivered at any level and the rate of airflow can be controlled.
<br>3. When the level of pollution by smoke, gases, or fumes is high, natural ventilation alone cannot be depended upon. Itis then mandatory that each machine has an air extraction cover.&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong><em>Disadvantages of artificial ventilation 
</em></strong><br>1. It requires skilled supervision and maintenance.
<br>2. The position of exhaust fans, vents and ducts should be included in the construction plans.
<br>3. It is expensive.
<br>4. A drought of fresh air is always more refreshing and invigorating,
<br>
<br><strong>EN-CONDITIONING&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>This is a new concept to revive indoor air quality (IAQ). The air quality in closed spaces is known
to be more harmful than open spaces and poorly ventilated rooms are known to spread respiratory
infections, congestion, colds, flu, itchy eyes, headaches and sleeplessness.
<br>To purify the air in closed spaces, en-conditioning technology was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide a pathogen and pollutant-free environment. It is based on a photo catalytic oxidation system that is useful in commercial spaces,
<br>
<br>1. In fruit and vegetable storage areas and in warehouses it can be used to extend the shelf life and curb losses due to decay by removing ethylene gas, which is produced during the ripening process, and which further hastens ripening.
<br>2. All airborne microorganisms are destroyed by combining the effects of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and photo-catalytic oxidation (PCO). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as the photo-catalyst. No filters are required and when TiO2, is irradiated with UV right, strong oxidizing agents called hydroxide radicals and super oxide ions are formed. The filter-less technology traps particles and breaks them up into vapors leaving almost no residue. The technology is completely green as it is ozone-free, and can keep the air 99.99% pure. It has been tested in various hospitals and guest rooms and has reduced infection-causing viruses, bacteria, mold, and fungi. It reduces bio-burden by 85% in 72 hours.
<br>3. It cleans the air of contaminants, allergens and removes unpleasant odors from closed spaces.
<br>4. It removes mold and mold spores that eat away expensive fabrics, upholstery, carpets, wall coverings and furnishings.
<br>5. The air in cold storage units can be sterilized as it is effective at low temperatures of 5°C to 0°C, thus increasing the shelf life of raw, semi-processed and processed food. 
<br>
<br>In the hospitality industry, it could be used in cold storage areas, hotel rooms, restaurants, banquets and other public areas and can significantly reduce the level of harmful airborne pathogens, allergens, contaminants, ethylene gas and odors. Airocide is one such enconditioner.

<br><strong>LIGHTING
</strong><br>Good lighting is essential in the kitchen and food storage areas because
<br>1. It helps the workers to see what they are doing clearly 
<br>2. Dirt or spoilage becomes more conspicuous
<br>3. It facilitates cleaning.
<br>4. It increases safety by preventing accidents
<br>5. It improves the overall quality and quantity of work.
<br>
<br>Lighting may be natural or artificial. In most establishments, artificial lighting is required to supplement natural lighting even during the day. There should be no gloomy corners or passages where dirt is likely to collect. Light-colored walls and ceilings reflect light and increase the amount of illumination. The window area should be one-fifth of the floor area to provide sufficient natural light in the room. Sinks and food preparation areas situated near or under windows get sufficient natural light during the day. Natural light should be made use of as far as possible as it is economical and good for health. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight have germicidal properties.
<br>
<br><strong>Artificial Lighting
</strong><br>Artificial lighting is of two types: light produced by combustion and light produced by an electric
current.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Light Produced by Combustion</em></strong> Substances that burn with a flame gives out light and heat. They use up oxygen from the air and contaminate it with waste substances. Nowadays, such lighting is used during power failure only or in remote areas where there is no electricity.
<br>The common forms of this type of lighting are candles, paraffin lamps and gas lights.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Disadvantages
</em></strong><br>1. It causes the blackening of walls. 
<br>2 Such lighting emits a slight smell because of incomplete combustion and there are chances of carbon monoxide formation. By-products are harmful.
<br>3. More labor and maintenance are required for these lights.
<br>4. The Light is insufficient and the flame flickers.
<br>5. It produces heat and there is the risk of fire.
<br>6. More ventilation is required as oxygen is used up.
<br><strong><em><br></em></strong><br><strong><em>Advantages</em></strong> 
<br>It is useful in emergencies like power failure.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Light Produced by Electricity</em></strong> Light produced by an electric current does not contaminate the air. As there is no combustion. oxygen is not used up and waste is not produced. It produces very little heat.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Advantages
</em></strong><br>1. It is convenient to use.
<br>2 There is no fear of contamination.
<br>3. No flicker is produced; the light is steady and uniform.
<br>4. Minimum heat is produced.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Disadvantages
</em></strong><br>1. Power failure causes total blackout.
<br>2 There is the risk of shock if electrical fittings and fixtures are not well maintained or are handled carelessly.
<br>
<br>Electric lighting used in catering establishments is of three types: tungsten filament bulbs, fluorescent tubes, and sodium vapor lamps. A tungsten filament bulb consists of a wire filament suspended in an inert gas. Such bulbs are available in clear as well as pearl or milky variety.
In a fluorescent tube, an electric current passes through mercury gas which acts on the fluorescent lining of the tube and causes it to glow. These tubes are cheaper and more efficient than tungsten filament bulbs. A tube lasts for up to 5,000 hours and a bulb lasts for only 1,000 hours. They are preferred because of economical consumption of electric energy. Tubes are suitable in the kitchen because they produce an even spread of shadow less light and very little glare. This light is comfortable to work in and increases work efficiency. Sometimes, fluorescent tubes may change the colour of the food. This problem can be effectively minimized by changing the tube or the shade or by adding more fixtures.
<br>Sodium vapor lamps also last longer than tungsten bulbs. They use less energy but provide much more light than fluorescent tubes.
<br>
<br><strong>Location and Amount of Light
</strong><br>Light should be from a good source and adequate light should fall on all work areas especially food preparation tables and sinks. There should be no glare or flicker. A constant, uniform source of light with minimum shadow is desirable.
<br>
<br>The location of lighting fixtures should be considered carefully. A number of small points of illumination usually produce less glare than one large point. Lights should give a clear view of the interiors of all equipment like cooking ranges, ovens, etc. Lighting is measured in terms of lux per
meter, i.e., the amount of illumination falling on a surface of | m at table height, approximately 75cms (30 inches) above floor level.
<br>
<br>The amount of lighting recommended in different areas is:
<br>1. Food storage area: 150 to 200 lux
<br>2. Food preparation, serving, and wash-up areas: 200 to 500 lux
<br>3. Dining or service area: as dim as desired, normally 200 lux
<br>Indirect light is best reflected from the ceiling,
<br>
<br><strong>Light Fittings
</strong><br>In general, light fittings should be easy to clean and should be corrosion-resistant. All fittings should be well maintained and in good repair. Electric bulbs should be enclosed in unbreakable white translucent globes and tube lights should be protected with a protective sleeve or cover, to prevent broken glass from contaminating food or food contact surfaces. Electric wires should be placed or fitted in such a way that they do not harbour dirt or insects and are easy to clean. Switches and bulb holders should be made of plastic, as kitchen walls may be steamy and damp. Average lighting conditions require one to four watts per square feet area.
<br>
<br><strong>Faulty Lighting
</strong><br>Insufficient lighting reduces output and has several ill effects on health. A poorly lit room causes headache, eyestrain, bad posture, irritability, and increases the chances of accidents. Workers are slack and untidy in their work. Thus, the total quality, as well as quantity of work done, is affected.
