                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Sanitary Procedures are very important during preparation, cooking and holding of food. Even if wholesome food is selected, microorganisms are still present in and on food not all food items served on the menu are cooked, for example, salads and normal cooking procedures destroy most pathogens but not necessarily spores or toxins.
<br>
<br><strong>Preparing Food
</strong><br>Procedures in Food Preparation The procedure to be followed will depend to a large extent on the food being prepared. Some common procedures which affect the microbial count are as follows:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Cleaning: </strong>Cereals and pulses are picked before they are milled or cooked, to remove grit, mud, stones, husk, mouldy and insect-infested grains. Green leaves are separated from the inedible roots and tough stalks.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Washing:</strong> Most foods need to be washed before preparation with potable cold water. Washing removes extraneous matter like surface dirt, soil and preservative and pesticide residue.
<br>Fruits and vegetables to be consumed raw should be washed in a solution of 50 ppm chlorine for five minutes or in a dilute solution of potassium permanganate. Leafy and salad vegetables should be washed thoroughly.
<br>Jn case of suspected or worm infestation, soak fresh vegetables like cauliflower in cold salted water for twenty minutes, If insects are present they will rise to the surface. Wash the body cavity of poultry well. Let all washed items drain well.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Pre preparation:</strong> This step includes peeling, trimming and soaking. Potable water must be used for pre-preparation and cooking. Fruits and vegetables need to be peeled, trimmed and cut to remove inedible or spoilt parts. Grains are soaked for sprouting. Potable water should be used for all pre-preparations. No food or food container should be placed on the floor as the floor is heavily contaminated. Keep all food on racks or shelves.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Thawing:</strong> Frozen foods should be thawed completely before cooking, unless the manufacturer, instructions are otherwise. Thawing large portions of food, joints and poultry takes time. Freezing only prevents bacteria from multiplying, it does not kill them. When a food thawed, these dormant microorganisms start multiplying rapidly once again.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Rules for Thawing Food Thaw or defrost food in any one of the following ways:
</em></strong><br>1. in the refrigerator below 40 C (39 F)
<br>2. in a thawing cabinet at temperatures between 10-15C
<br>3. in potable running water at 21c or below while it is still in the packet
<br>4. in a microwave oven, only when it has to be cooked immediately
<br>5. as part of conventional cooking, for example, certain frozen foods like frozen vegetables and ready-to-eat chicken preparations are cooked in the frozen state and quickly thaw when they are cooked.
<br><br><strong>Hot Holding of Food
</strong><br>In most commercial kitchens food service continues over a period of three to four hours during the busy lunch hour. In such cases it is more convenient to store food hot at temperatures above the danger zone, instead of cooling and reheating it every time before serving. For this purpose, a bain-marie or a hot cupboard is used. This equipment’s are heated by gas or electricity. Care should be taken that the internal temperature of the food should be above 63 C to prevent growth of bacteria. They should be pre-heated before placing hot food in them. They are not suitable for reheating cold foods as this process would take a lot of time to reach the safe temperature of 63 C and food would remain in the danger zone till then, permitting rapid multiplication of bacteria.
<br>
<br><strong>Cooling Food
</strong><br>Any perishable food which is not to be consumed immediately should be kept outside the danger zone. Cold preparations like desserts should be cooled as soon as possible to 15C and stored in the refrigerator. Food should not be refrigerated while it is still hot, otherwise the maximum internal temperature in the refrigerator of 4C would increase and favor spoilage of other foods stored in the refrigerator. Food must be cooled prior to refrigeration in the coolest part of the kitchen. Large volumes cool faster when divided into smaller portions or when kept in shallow containers. Cooling can be hastened by keeping food containers in ice-cold water or in quick-chill units. Food cools faster when the container is placed in water, as water is a better conductor of heat than air. Stirring food occasionally brings about a uniform drop in temperature and faster cooling.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Other factors which influence the cooling process are
</em></strong><br>1. the type of food
<br>2. the temperature in the refrigerator or quick-chill unit
<br>3. the container used —size of container, material it is made of and covering if any.
<br>
<br>Cooked food which is not to be consumed immediately, should be refrigerated within 1 1/2 hours at 40C or below. If refrigerator space is inadequate, it is wise to purchase a quick-chill unit or extra bain-maries for ice chilling. Large catering units should have walk-in chillers for rapid cooling of cooked food.
<br>
<br><strong>Hot Foods
</strong><br>To maintain high culinary quality, food should be prepared when it is needed and served as soon as it is prepared. But this situation is not feasible in most catering establishments as the volume of production is enormous and volume of sales cannot be accurately predicted. To serve hundreds of lunches in a two-hour lunch break, calls for preparing most of the items on the menu in advance. Foods which have to be served over an extended lunch hour can be held hot with the help of a bain-marie, double boiler, steam table or chaffing dish. The food handler should understand that these gadgets are not meant for reheating food but only for hot-holding of foods. If used for reheating, food will remain in the danger zone for a longer time.
<br>The temperature at which food remains in the hot-holding equipment is very important and should not be less than 63C. If this temperature is not maintained, it is likely that food spoilage will occur rapidly. Before keeping food in any of these equipment’s, it should be heated to 74C (165 F) and transferred immediately.
<br>
<br><strong><em>The following precautions should be taken during hot holding of foods:
</em></strong><br>1. keep food covered to prevent heat loss
<br>2. check temperature with a thermometer and not by just touching it with hand
<br>3. stir food occasionally for even heating as lower surfaces get heated and upper surfaces get cooled by air
<br>4. use proper serving equipment like long-handled ladles and scoops to minimize hand contact. Keep ladle in a clean place when not in use
<br>5. prepare and keep only required amounts as extended heating will affect flavor and quality
<br>6. dry preparations like chapatti’s, fried items and baked items may dry further or get overcooked during hot holding
<br>
<br><strong>Storage Temperature of Prepared Foods
</strong><br>The Food Hygiene (Amendment) Regulations, 1990 and 1991 have introduced a complex set of controls over the storage temperatures of prepared foods. Foods are divided into two categories, some of which should be kept at 8C or less and some that should be kept at 5C or less. All hot foods must be kept above 63C. There are exemptions from temperature control for limited periods of time for foods freshly prepared on site or on display for sale in catering outlets. The 5C temperature requirement became effective on 01 April, 1993.
<br>
<br>Though chilling helps in extending the shelf life of food products, it can be effective only when high standards of hygiene are observed. The caterer should store all perishable products below 5C as soon as possible. The same chilled storage temperatures are applicable to food in large delivery vehicles. Small vans making local deliveries are allowed to operate to a standard of 8C for all foods, even those in the 5C category. Caterers should check temperatures on receiving deliveries. An allowance of 2C in the temperature is given for up to two hours for the following:
<br>
<br>1. defrosting of equipment
<br>2. breakdown of refrigeration equipment
<br>3. during cold food preparation in the kitchen
<br>4. when food is moved around on the premises
<br>Exemptions for certain foods from temperature control
<br>1. Certain foods are processed in such a way that it prevents the growth of pathogens, for example, sterilized canned food. Canned foods which have been only pasteurized should be refrigerated and this should be indicated on the label.
<br>2. Sandwiches with perishable fillings can be held at 8C or below for a period of 24 hours only.
<br>3. Mawa or Khoa should always be refrigerated and used within 24 hours.
<br>
<br><strong>PREPARATION OF SPECIFIC FOODS</strong>
<br>
<br><strong><em>Meat
</em></strong><br>Meat is a highly perishable food and gets contaminated from various sources by the time it reaches the kitchen. It should be washed and trimmed if required before it is cooked. Separate knives, cleavers and chopping boards should be used for raw and cooked meat to reduce chances of cross-contamination.
<br>
<br>Bacteria from raw meat may remain on improperly washed equipment and if the same equipment is used for cutting ready-to-eat meat, like cold cuts which are eaten without further cooking, the chances of food poisoning occurring become very high. The bacteria on the raw meat are likely to get destroyed once meat is cooked. After handling raw meat, wash hands well before touching cooked meat or any other ready-to-eat foods which are not going to be heated again.
<br>In the butchery, work table surfaces should be made of impervious material which is easy to clean. The chopping block can be made of hardwood and should be light enough to be removed for cleaning, scraping and rinsing after every use. While deboning meat and making rolled joints, chances of contamination increase. Such joints should be cut into small portions and cooked well to kill microorganisms that may be present in the centre of the cut.
<br>
<br>Minced meat is at a higher risk than meat because microorganisms present on the outer surface of meat get distributed throughout the entire mass of mince. Minced meat is also handled more and spoils much faster, leading to discoloration and foul odors and may cause food-borne illnesses. To reduce the chances of spoilage, the following precautions should be taken:
<br>
<br>1. mince the quantity required for the day only
<br>2. cook mince thoroughly at sufficiently high temperatures
<br>3. surplus mince should be cooled rapidly in small portions
<br>4. refrigerate surplus immediately
<br>5. reheat mince thoroughly before serving
<br>6. if root vegetables like potatoes, carrots or onions are cooked along with mince, clean them thoroughly to remove heat-resistant soil organisms.
<br><br><strong><em>Fish
</em></strong><br>The best way to prepare fish is to place a stone slab long enough to fit across the sink used for fish preparation and about two-third the width of the sink. Place a hard wood board on it for cutting fish. This arrangement allows a continuous flow of clean water with the wash water going down the drain of the sink.
<br>
<br><strong><em>Fresh Fruits and Vegetables
</em></strong><br>Vegetables should be thoroughly washed to remove all traces of soil. If necessary, root vegetables may have to be soaked for some time and scrubbed clean as soil may contain Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli along with other intestinal pathogens. Some vegetables, like carrots and ginger, may be scraped, fruits should be washed well and peeled if required before they are served. Peeling helps in reducing microbial load and preservative or pesticide residue if any.
<br>Green leafy vegetables should be washed under running water. Lettuce should be broken up and washed. Leaves should be drained well. A separate sink should be allotted for vegetables and fruit preparation. Spoilt, inedible portions should be removed.
<br>When food is handled carelessly it is likely to get contaminated or spoilt and may result in food poisoning.
