</strong><br><strong><br></strong><br>As we have discussed, check-out is a very critical step of the guest cycle. The departure procedure should be simple and short. The guests who are checking out of the hotel are often in a hurry to catch a flight or a train. Hotels should take measures to avoid the formation of long queues at the front desk during peak check-out periods. A speedy check-out procedure and an error-free billing
<br>leave a lasting good impression on the guest. A guest who leaves the hotel with a good impression will return to the hotel/chain and will also recommend the hotel chain to her friends and relatives. Despite measures taken by hotels to avoid problems during the check-out process, the following problems may occur during the departure of a guest:
<br>● Late check out
<br>● Long queues at the cashier counter
<br>● Improper posting of charges in the guest folio
<br>
<br>These problems can be rectified by informing the guests about check-in and check-out times at the time of registration, installing self check-out terminals, and implementing an accurate guest accounting system.
<br>
<br><strong>Late Check-outs
</strong><br>Most hotels have a fixed check-out time—generally 12 noon—at which the departing guests must vacate their rooms and settle their bills. If a guest vacates his room after the check-out time, it is considered late check-out. This may create a problem. especially during high occupancy periods, as the guests with confirmed reservations will be required to wait for the room to be vacated and cleaned. A hotel may take the following preventive measures to minimize late check-outs:
<br>● Inform the guest about the check-out time and late check-out charges at the time of reservation and also at registration.
<br>● Have the information regarding the check-out timings printed on the key card and displayed at the back of the room doors.
<br>● Add the late check-out charges to the guest bill.
<br>● Request the guests to vacate the room as per the check-out time and offer to keep their luggage in the left luggage room at no extra cost.
<br>● In case of groups, provide hospitality rooms without any extra charges.
<br>
<br><strong>Long Queues at the Cashier
</strong><br>The standard check-out procedure, involving a number of steps dealing with the presentation and settlement of bills, takes some time. As more and more guests now want a speedy and queue-free check-out, hotels are coming up with alternatives to the standard check-out. These alternative methods are express check-out and self check-out terminals.
<br><br><strong>Express Check-out (ECO)</strong> The front desk is flooded with check-out requests at the hotel check-out time. As the preparation and settlement of bills is a time-consuming process, it leads to the formation of a long queue at the front office cashier's desk. To avoid this situation, some hotels have developed a speedier check-out procedure known as express check-out.
<br>The express check-out procedure requires the guest to fill the express check-out (ECO) form and a pre-departure folio. The ECO form is an authorization by the guest to the hotel authorities to charge the outstanding balance to his credit card. By signing the ECO form, the guest agrees to pay the amount finalized by the front desk cashier after his departure. These forms are available at the front desk or are sent to the guest on the morning of the date of departure. The ECO form is accompanied by a copy of the guest's folio, indicating the approximate total bill.
<br>By signing the ECO, the guest transfers his outstanding folio balance to the credit card voucher (created at the time of registration). Some hotels have the policy to take the imprint of the credit cards of the guest to avoid any problems or disputes in the future. In case the final amount varies considerably from the approximate total amount—due to the use of any chargeable facility by the guest after signing the ECO form—the guest may be informed about the same. The variance may also be there in case of any late charges received by the front desk cashier. After signing the ECO form, the guest can leave the hotel at his convenience without having to go to the front desk or cashier’s desk for the standard check-out procedure.
<br>Once the guest has departed from the hotel, the front desk cashier finalizes his account, including any late charges, and completes the imprinted credit card voucher. The guest’s signature on the ECO form replaces the signature on the credit card voucher as the guest’s agreement to make the payment. The hotel sends the signed ECO and the filled imprint to the credit card company for the settlement of the final bill and mails a copy of the bill to the guest’s mailing address.
<br>The express check-out service reduces the pressure at the cashier’s desk. It also enables guests to avoid long queues and wailing time at the cashier’s desk during peak check-out times and leave at their convenience.
<br>
<br><strong>Self Check-out</strong> Only fully automated hotels are equipped with self-service terminals, which allow guests to check-in/check-out promptly by operating these interactive machines. They are available with options like check-out only, check-in/check-out, and also cash acceptor. Generally located in the hotel lobby, the self check-out terminals are interfaced with the property management system (PMs) of the hotel. They are also designed to be compatible with a system that allows air travelers to print boarding passes while checking out of the hotel.
<br>Self-check-in and check-out kiosks identify guests by their rooms’ card keys or their credit cards, as in some cases the guests’ credit cards may be coded like their room keys. At self check-out terminals, guests can access and review their folios and settle their accounts using credit cards. The check-out is completed when the guest's outstanding balance is posted to his credit card account. The terminal dispenses a printed statement of the account settlement. Simultaneously, the system communicates the room status to the front desk computer. The front office module of the PMS automatically updates the room status and other records like guest history cards. The self check-out terminals have the following benefits:
<br>
<br>● They minimize the guests’ waiting time as the guests can check-out themselves by operating the check-out kiosk and can settle their outstanding bills through credit card without having to go to the front desk cashier.
<br>● They simplify the check-in and check-out procedure as the guests can easily follow the interactive instructions on the screen.
<br>● They eliminate the scope of human error as they are integrated with the hotel PMS and thus track all the financial transactions between a guest and the hotel’s points of sale and other sections.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Improper Posting of Charges
</strong><br>There are occasions when a guest’s financial transactions are not properly posted in the guest folio and the final bill is inaccurate. This might be due to human error or system error. The front desk is flooded with check-out requests at peak check- out times and the cashier might make some mistake in the posting of charges or the calculation of bills. This could lead to a dispute with the guest and delay other guests in the queue. The whole experience can be quite damaging for the hotel.  To avoid this, hotels should install guest accounting systems, which are more accurate and faster, leading to higher guest satisfaction.
