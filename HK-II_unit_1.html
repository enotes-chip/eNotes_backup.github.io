                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Introduction
</strong><br>The term ‘Linen’, in a technical sense, is the stem fiber extracted from the cultivated plant called flax, which is spun into yarn and woven into fabric. In a commercial sense, the present-day usage of the term linen includes all fabrics that are used in the hospitality industry.
<br>
<br>Linen is the housekeeping department's second-largest expense. Linen is expensive to replace, and if it is well maintained, correctly laundered, and properly stored, its life can be extended. Soiled, worn, or creased linen leaves a bad impression of the cleaning standards in a hotel. Guests dissatisfied by this may be lost forever. 
<br>
<br>Efficient linen and laundry management ensures that large volumes of soiled linen are washed and treated so as to look neat, smell fresh, and feel crisp and that they are disbursed at the right time and to the right place. Linen may be cleaned either on or off the hotel premises. Hotels whose laundry output is sufficiently high and which have adequate space available opt for on-premises laundry (OPL). 
<br>
<br><strong>THE LINEN ROOM
</strong><br>The linen and uniform room is a central depot for all hotel linen and this is the place from where clean articles of linen are distributed throughout the establishment. The uniform room almost always exists in close association with the linen room. The bulk of clean linen and uniforms awaiting reuse are stored here.
<br>
<br><strong>Linen Room Organization
</strong><br>There are primarily two types of linen rooms:
<br>
<br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><em>Centralized and Decentralized.
</em><br>
<br><strong>Centralized linen</strong> room In this system, linen from all floors is collected and sorted in one central area. The linen room supervisor has complete control over the linen room. All linen issues and receipts go out from here.
<br>
<br><strong>Decentralized linen room</strong> In this system, each floor maintains its own par stock of linen. As and when necessary, these are replenished from the main linen room. The linen par is stored in floor pantries, and the floor supervisors are responsible for maintaining the par level. This system works well in hotels that have a large number of floors. The system is also used in resorts, where rooms are spread out across a large expanse of area.
<br>
<br><strong>Activities in the Linen and Uniform Room
</strong><br>The following activities are carried out in a linen room:
<br>
<br><strong>‣ </strong>Collection of soiled linen 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Counting and sorting of soiled linen 
<br><strong>‣</strong> Packing of soiled linen for the laundry
<br><strong>‣</strong> Dispatch of soiled linen to the laundry
<br><strong>‣</strong> Receipt of fresh linen from the laundry
<br><strong>‣</strong> Checking and sorting of fresh linen
<br><strong>‣</strong> Storage of fresh linen
<br><strong>‣</strong> Distribution of fresh linen to the floors and other areas
<br><strong>‣</strong> Stock-taking for linen and maintenance of records
<br><strong>‣</strong> Stitching, repairing, and monogramming of all hotel linen and uniforms
<br><strong>‣</strong> Uniform &amp; Linen selection
<br><strong>‣</strong> Uniform storage and issue
<br><strong>‣</strong> Discarding unusable linen
<br>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Location</strong> The linen room must be such as to facilitate the easy flow of linen to and from the laundry. In case a commercial laundry is being used, the linen room should be accessible for receipt and dispatch of linen from the back entrance of the hotel. The linen room’s location must also facilitate easy issue and receipt of linen from the guest floors and other departments. Therefore, it should be situated near the service elevator. Another consideration for the linen room's location is easy to access from the executive housekeeper’s office. The linen room should also be a good distance away from the food production area, as linen absorbs odors easily. Also, the location should be such that it allows for proper ventilation of the linen room.
<br>
<br><strong>Space</strong> The total space allocated for the linen room will depend on the size of the hotel and the activities to be carried out in the linen room. The minimum space requirement for a linen room is 6 sq ft or more, which may suffice for a small hotel. Space is required for linen storage areas and a linen exchange counter. Space is also allocated for the storage of uniforms and for a uniform exchange counter. Set apart from these should be a soiled linen collection area. Adequate space is also needed for the inspection tables, the linen room supervisor's desk, and the guest laundry area. and the sewing room.
<br>
<br><strong>Entrance</strong> A common entrance-cum-exit point is ideal for security reasons. It should be at least 4 feet wide and without a threshold so as to ensure easy movement of trolleys. A stable-type door is recommended so that unauthorized persons are deterred from entering the room. This barrier itself can serve as the linen exchange counter.
<br>
<br><strong>Floors and walls</strong> The floor must be sturdy enough to bear a load of heavy trolleys moving across it. Tiles should be avoided as they tend to chip. Walls should be of a material that can be easily cleaned at frequent intervals. Tiled walls are ideal.
<br>
<br><strong>Lighting and ventilation</strong> Though most of the linen rooms are meant for storage, adequate ventilation is important to prevent the growth of mildew, even though natural light may be less. Shadowless lighting in the form of fluorescent lamps is required. The air must be free of humidity and maintained at a temperature of 20°C.
<br>
<br><strong>Storage</strong> Linen storage shelves should be designed for maximum utilization of space. The shelves also need to be sturdy and firmly fixed as the weight they bear may be considerable. They may reach up to the ceiling provided that there is ample ventilation and that equipment is available for safe access. There should be a clearance of 6 inches below the lowermost shelf. All shelves must be slatted for thorough ventilation of stored linen. The depth of the shelves should be about 18-20 inches if they are against the wall. In case the shelves are to be accessible from both sides, the depth may be 36-40 inches. Linen articles meant to be stored for longer periods of time should be stored on shelves with slatted sliding doors or curtains to prevent dust from settling. Storage shelves should also be allocated for condemned linen or discards.
<br>
<br><strong>Soiled</strong> linen area This area should be close to the entrance and must be large enough to accommodate all the soiled linen. There should be enough space to sort and count the linen and to move and park the trolleys. The floor and storage units in this area should consist of surfaces that do not stain damp linen.
<br>Linen exchange counter This is usually a window without any grilles, wide enough to pass bundles of linen through. The window normally opens downward, with the shutter forming a counter. The area below this counter may be used to park trolleys to collect the soiled linen. When not in use, this counter should be taken up and kept bolted as a window shutter. As mentioned earlier, the stable-type door at the entrance of the linen room may also function as an exchange counter.
<br>
<br><strong>Inspection area</strong> This area consists mainly of the inspection table, which should be large enough to accommodate the freshly washed linen that needs to be inspected. A 100-room property may require a table of about 10 ft x 6 ft size. A folding table or one that may be dismantled is ideal. The color of the tabletop should contrast with the color of the linen. If a one-piece or non-folding table is used, the space below the table may be utilized for storage.
<br>
<br><strong>Uniform storage</strong> area Uniforms are normally hung on hangers, numerically segregated according to designation and department. A mobile uniform stand may also be used. Standard-sized uniforms are segregated according to size and stacked in racks. An exchange counter should be located close to the storage area.
<br>
<br><strong>Guest laundry</strong> area In hotels where the OPL does not directly accept the guest laundry, space must be allocated for storing, marking, and recording soiled guest articles before they are sent to the laundry. Fresh guest laundry on receipt from the laundry must be stored according to room numbers or hung on hangers for delivery. A table, a mobile rail for hanging clothes, and racks designed to hold the laundry as per room numbers may be designed for the purpose. A sink and an ironing table are also necessary for a hotel with no OPL.
<br>
<br><strong>Linen room supervisor's desk</strong> The desk should be located in such a way that the supervisor has a good view of the entire room, especially the transaction points. The desk, cupboards, and drawers should be designed to accommodate the files and records maintained in the linen room. It also accommodates the telephone.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Equipment Used in Linen &amp; Uniform Room
</strong><br>1. Racks
<br>2. Mobile trolleys
<br>3. Ironing board with iron
<br>4. Hangers
<br>5. Worktable
<br>6. Trolleys ( for transporting uniforms)
<br>7. Marking machine
<br>8. Telephone
<br>9. Computer system
<br>10. Supervisors desk
<br>11. Shelves
<br><br><strong>STORAGE OF LINEN
</strong><br>While in storage, linen must be kept free from dust. It is inevitable that where linen is handled, dust and fluff will be present. Therefore all fresh linen should be stored undercover. Linen may be covered by curtains drawn across the shelves or they may be stored in cupboards with slatted sliding doors. Articles that are not in frequent use, such as mattress protectors, curtains, and blankets, may be stored covered with dust sheets. The linen stock should be rotated in order on a 'first-in, first-out' basis. While placing fresh linen on shelves, especially the heavier ones, it should be ensured that the fold faces outwards. Also, heavier linen should be placed on lower shelves. Smaller articles such as face towels and serviettes are placed in bundles of 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
