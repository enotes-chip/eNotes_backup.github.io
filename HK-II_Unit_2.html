                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Uniforms are outfits of specified material, colour, and design, usually provided by the establishment, for certain staff such that all employees in equivalent or similar positions wear identical outfits. 
<br>
<br>Uniforms are issued to most people who work in the hospitality industry, especially salaried employees. Employees in the 'back of the house' areas normally wear functional yet pleasing uniforms. Uniforms for the restaurant and front office staff must not only be functional but must also go with the ambience of the area they work in. For example, a poolside restaurant in a resort property can have stewards dressed in the Bermudas and a floral shirt with accessories such as a straw hat and sandals. Many hotels now prefer their employees to retain the feel of the region in which the hotel is situated and to showcase the culture and tradition of the place. A hotel that is very 'Indian' can have a doorman dressed up as a royal Punjabi guard with appropriate accessories. Managers, executives, and senior staff have uniforms to enhance their image. 
<br>
<br>In most hotels, the housekeeping department is the custodian of uniforms for all hotel employees. A reasonable uniform programme should allow the issue of two uniforms to each employee upon employment and the third set on confirmation.
<br>
<br><strong>SELECTION AND DESIGN OF UNIFORMS</strong>
<br>Terry cottons are the most popular choice for uniforms as they have the advantages of both natural and synthetic fibres. Suiting materials are used for trousers and skirts. Drill ( cot­ton) is the popular choice for cooks' coats and aprons as it is cool, durable, and easy to maintain. Gabardine or any white suiting material may be used for chefs' coats, as they keep up appearances. 
<br>
<br><strong>Points to be Considered while Designing Uniforms</strong> 
<br>The following points should be kept in mind while designing uniforms. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>General profile of the employees</em></strong> The cultural background, age, and so on of the hotel's employees need to be kept in mind along with the hotel's ethos and the employees' work profiles. Some hotels even involve the staff concerned while designing their uniforms. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Image and identity of the property</em></strong> If the hotel wants to create a desirable, eye-catching, smart, efficient, and professional image, the uniforms should be chosen to reflect, and indeed create this impression. Emblems, badges, and embroidery can customize the uniforms so as to identify the hotel, the department, and the employee. The uniform can also match the decor and theme of the hotel, thereby reinforcing the image of the property.
<br>
<br><em><strong>Comfort in wear</strong></em> This depends on the right fabric being used, and even more important on a good fit. Hotel staff have to be active and hardworking, and the· uniform should complement this. They may need to reach, bend, stretch, or squat. The fit of the uniform should be such that it does not bind or restrict movement. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Purpose of work</em></strong> Designing for the purpose of the work is of paramount importance. Pockets are an important part of designing. A pair of dungarees or overalls must have several deep pockets for the maintenance employee to keep tools handy. A steward must have pockets that are not very conspicuous to keep a pen, lighter, and so on. Shoes chosen for the cooks must be skid-proof. Short sleeves are more practical for GRAs. Some uniform accessories, such as the headwear of kitchen staff (toque), also fulfil an important hygiene function in addition to making their work easier. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Appearance and style</em></strong> While keeping in mind the environment of the establishment a uniform should be designed in such a way that it will look equally good on the stout and thin, the tall and short. Well-made garments use fabrics that are designed for heavy wear, and their workmanship must support that. That way, they will stay bright and look new through countless launderings. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Climatic conditions</em></strong> of the place These must be considered especially if the hotel is not centrally air-conditioned. A full-sleeved terylene shirt with a tie can be stifling for a steward in a humid area. Generally, cooks and maintenance crew use 100 percent drill uniforms. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Budget and value for money</em></strong> In the selection of fabric for uniforms, one should keep in mind the allocated budget, and seek value for money. Laundering and maintaining uniforms is a challenge. Uniforms that look good, are comfortable, and maintain their appearance through a number of laundry cycles are more economical than cheap fabrics that do not perform or last. Blends are easier and cheaper to maintain; however, blends are not recom­mended for employees working in greasy areas (cooks, maintenance staff) as synthetics and blends do not let go of grease and perspiration stains easily. Also, the fewer the accessories, the less the headache of keeping a tab of them, and usually, the lower the expense. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Fabric</em></strong> Fabric selection is also a critical factor to consider when purchasing materials for uniforms. Cotton outfits are preferred as uniforms because they are porous and more absorbent than polyester and cotton blends. However, blends with cotton are increasing in popularity because they have better soil-release qualities in general and at the same time retain some coolness. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Ease of availability of materials</em></strong> The fabric and accessories chosen for the uniforms must be readily available whenever new uniforms are required. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>Staff turnover</em></strong> This is another challenge. Free-size uniforms can be used in high-turnover areas to address this. Trousers or skirts can have elasticated waistbands to accommodate different sizes. 
<br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>Uniform Management in Hotels 
</strong><br>Efficient management of uniforms in hotels needs the following procedures to be followed. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>1. Establishment of par levels for uniforms </em></strong>Hotels generally maintain 3-par for uniforms. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>2. Preparation of a budget for uniforms</em></strong> The Executive Housekeeper (EHK) with the help of the Uniform Room Supervisor makes the budget for the uniforms for the entire hotel staff. Before budgeting, a detailed survey of the market and current trends needs to be done since the expenditure involved is high. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>3. Developing and implementing an effective uniform control system</em></strong> It is essential that the housekeeping department develops a system of controlling uniform distribution and usage, monitored by the EHK. The system should include recording the following: 
<br>
<br><em>Name of the person receiving a uniform
</em><br>» Date of issue
<br>» Number of pieces issued
<br>» A record of misplaced or stolen items
<br>» A record of any uniforms that are out on temporary loan
<br>
<br><strong>4.Designing new uniforms </strong>The housekeeper has to undertake this task keeping in mind changing trends. The following process is followed: 
<br><strong>» </strong>After the budget is sanctioned, sample uniforms are made by the EHK for all departments. The points to be considered while designing uniforms have been discussed earlier in the chapter.
<br><strong>» </strong>The samples are then sent to the laundry for checks on colour fastness and durability 
<br><strong>»</strong> After approval of samples, a purchase requisition is made and given to the purchase department for the purchase of fabric 
<br><strong>»</strong> Uniforms for stitched by the tailors at the hotel’s sewing room or a uniform contractor 
<br><strong>»</strong> Trials are carried out for all the staff members and the required alterations are done 
<br><strong>» </strong>The new uniforms are received or sent to the uniform room for tagging with codes for each staff member
<br>
<br><strong>5. Outfitting new personnel</strong> A new employee joining any department has to have a Uniform Request Form signed by the Personnel Manager as well as the HOD. If the employee is a part-timer or trainee, old uniforms in good condition and fit can be issued.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Uniform exchange procedure 
</strong><br>The following procedure is followed: 
<br>
<br>» A clean set is issued in exchange for a soiled set.
<br>» The uniform room attendant checks the condition of the uniform for any damage or repair.
<br>» The uniforms are then sorted based on the fabric and sent to the laundry for washing.
<br>» The number and type of uniforms sent to the laundry are entered in the 'soiled uniform account register'.
<br>
<br><strong>Storing uniforms 
</strong><br>The following steps are followed: 
<br>
<br>» On return from laundry, the uniforms are sorted out department wise.
<br>» The uniforms received are then tallied with the soiled uniform account register.
<br>» The uniforms are then hung on hangers and stored in the uniform room.
<br>» In many properties, auto valet systems are installed. These consist of a computerized system with single or multi-distribution conveyors where the uniforms are hung and delivered from.
<br>
<br><strong>Maintenance and upkeep of uniforms</strong> The uniform room attendant keep a check on the condition of the uniforms for any damage or repair. Such repairs should be carried out immediately by the tailors. 
<br>
<br><strong>Replacement of uniforms</strong> If any uniform has to be replaced due to misplacement, theft, or damage, the request has to come from the HOD and be authorized by the EHK. 
<br>
<br><strong>Recovering uniforms</strong> from staff who have resigned or been terminated The housekeep­ing and the personnel department should be informed by the concerned departments about employees who have resigned or been terminated, so that their uniforms may be taken back. In case the uniforms returned are not in good condition or unjustifiably damaged, the employee may be charged. 
<br>
<br><strong>Disposal of old uniforms</strong> Old and many used uniforms are condemned and sent to charitable institutions. Old uniforms in good condition are used for trainees in various departments 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>ESTABLISHING PAR LEVELS FOR UNIFORMS
</strong><br>When drawing up a budget for uniforms, consideration should be given to the staff turnover, life expectancy of the garments, seasonal requirements, anticipated changes in decor, and laundry requirements. As a general rule, staff should be supplied with at least 2-3 sets of outfits. Kitchen staff requires at least 4 sets of whites, and more if they enter the restaurant. 
<br>
<br><strong>Number of Sets 
</strong><br>When deciding the number of sets of uniforms needed by staff, the following factors are to be considered: 
<br>
<br><strong>Uniform material</strong> The life expectancy of a uniform is between 12-18 months and the material chosen should last for the expected lifespan. Uniforms made of cotton-for example, a chef’s coat, trousers or utility worker’s uniforms will need to be changed daily. Terry cotton and polyester may need to be changed after every 2 days, whereas for silk it may be 3 days. 
<br>
<br><strong>Nature of job</strong> Some jobs in hotels is strenuous in nature. These jobs include those of GRA’s, housemen, utility workers, the maintenance crew, and so on. These workers may require a change of uniform more often. Similarly, staff coming into contact with food as well as those in the 'front of the house' areas would require a change more often than the others. Uniforms for executives are dry-cleaned only periodically. 
<br>
<br><strong>Frequency of laundering </strong>Depending on how often uniforms are sent to the laundry and whether the laundry is in-house or a contracted service would also influence the number of sets required.
<br>
<br><strong>Calculating par Stock Quantity for Uniforms 
</strong><br>If uniforms are normally changed every alternate day then the number of pars required is 3 - on any given day, one is with an employee (in use), one is in the linen and uniform room and one is in the laundry.
<br>
<br>If uniforms are changed every day, as for cooks 5 sets are required more sets may be required if laundering takes more than 24 hours. 
<br>The following information is required if stocks are to be established 
<br>» The total number of uniformed employees in the hotel their departments, and their definitions 
<br>» Men - women ratio 
<br>» Staff turnover patterns 
<br>» Frequency of laundering 
<br>» Time taken for laundering
<br>
<br><strong>STORAGE OF UNIFORMS 
</strong><br>Fresh uniforms received from the laundry by the linen room are stored according to the department and designation of the staff. Each uniform should bear the department's name, the employee's designation, and a serial number on the collar of the shirt or equivalent garment. The linen room storage area should be properly aired. The humid­ity of the room should be less than 20 percent. 
<br>In many hotels, staff members are not allowed to take their uniforms outside the hotel. Instead, the employees are provided with lockers to keep their uniforms at the end of the shift. 
<br>
<br><strong>ISSUING AND EXCHANGING OF UNIFORMS</strong> 
<br>In this section, we shall discuss the process of issuing and exchanging uniforms for employees 
<br>
<br><strong>Issuing uniforms to new employees 
</strong><br>In the case of new employees, uniforms or issued against specific authorization letters received from the personnel department. Their employees are required to sign for his or her particular uniform. A uniform issue slip is also provided to the employee by the personnel department to let him/her prove that he/she is a new employee and is part of the organization. The uniform is then issued from the Linen room where the name of the department and the items issued or entered in the register and the signature of the employee are taken.
<br>
<br><strong>Issuing uniforms to regular employees 
</strong><br>uniforms are usually given to employees on one for one basis that is one Fresh uniform for soiled one. Only when leaving the organization, an employee has to get a signature for uniform clearance from the linen room supervisor, failing which the Last paycheck is withheld.
<br>
<br><strong>Uniform Exchange Procedure 
</strong><br>A uniform register in which the movement of uniforms is recorded is maintained by the linen and uniform room supervisor. The procedure is as follow:
<br>» For regular employees, ensure that they have arrived for uniform exchange at the stipulated time.
<br>» Check the uniform being returned for any damage.
<br>» Issue a fresh uniform strictly on a one-for-one basis ensuring that it is of the correct size and name (if the uniform is specially tailored for a person).
<br>» Make out the uniform exchange slip in duplicate only when the employee deposits a soiled uniform and takes the clean one on the following day. In order to put forth his/her claim, the employee has to produce the uniform slip, authorizing his /her entitled to the uniforms. The original uniform slip is given to the employee and the duplicate is retained in the uniform exchange slip book. 
<br>» If the soiled uniform is found to be damaged such that it can be mended, warn the employee. If the uniform cannot be mended, report the matter to the supervisor.
<br>
<br><strong>ADVANTAGES OF PROVIDING STAFF UNIFORMS
</strong><br>Having uniforms for the staff is essential at most hospitality properties, for the following reasons: 
<br>
<br>» They ensure a well-groomed appearance for staff.
<br>» They help to create an atmosphere or set the scene. For example, a uniform may match the decor or the theme of the property.
<br>» They help identify the hotel staff and their position to the guest.
<br>» They help differentiate between staff and guests.
<br>» If made in the right design for work, they provide comfort for the staff.
<br>» They instil a feeling of belongingness and loyalty to the establishment among the staff.
<br>» They enhance the spirit of teamwork.
<br>» They allow employees to save money on working clothes and costs of laundering.
<br>» It is easier for staff to take up messy jobs when they know that their own clothes are not involved.
<br>» Some uniforms may have a protective role.
<br>» Some uniforms may confer prestige on the wearer.
<br>
<br><strong>TRENDS IN HOTEL UNIFORMS
</strong><br>Ideal uniform designs comprise the attributes of functionality, comfort, appearance, and character. Hotel properties now give immense significance to designing uniforms and take onboard fashion designers who consequently have discussions with the hotel's staff and develop trendy, comfortable uniforms. Some of the emerging trends in hotel uniforms are as follows. 
<br>
<br><strong>Customized uniforms</strong> Where in earlier times, most hotels went on with the usual uni­form fare in hotels, the trend now is for a designer to customize uniforms post discussion with the hotel's staff. 
<br>
<br><strong>Vibrant colours</strong> A new trend for vibrant colours has replaced the generic designs that once dominated the hospitality sector. These colours appear like splashes of vibrant hues in scarves, embroideries, accent, or trim rather than the base colours of uniforms. Luxury resorts are embracing brighter, livelier colours in uniforms as representative of their environment. Bright shades of blue, citrus and clear greens are finding their way in splashes on staff uniforms in such properties. The formal suits too are moving away from the traditional black to dynamic shades of charcoal grey. 
<br>
<br><strong>Monochromatic look</strong> Designers suggest that the uniform that is monochromatic top and bottom build in simplicity and more sophistication. The look is more flattering than a two colour outfit which cuts people into two. Hence, more and more properties now have front desk staff especially, sporting an all-black, all-grey, or all-brown uniform with a splash of colour in accessories.
<br> 
<br><strong>Contemporary lines</strong> A sleek design as seen in fitted shirts and nipped at the waist apparel for ladies is the trend now. 
<br>
<br><strong>Blending in the casual look</strong> Uniforms are increasingly taking on more of a casual look than formal. Hotels are doing away with the conservatively dressed look, blending in a more casual look in the formal uniforms. As hotels move in to engage the guests in all core areas, bringing in a semi-casual flavour gives employees a fresh, approachable, and relaxed look. An example for the same is a streamlined 3/ 4th sleeve blouse for lady guest service associates. The staff of many properties also sport the casual look on weekends. 
<br>
<br><strong>Local flair</strong> With increasing competition, hotel properties are distinguishing themselves by building a story into their property with their uniform programme reflecting their local culture and geography. Many properties draw in from their rich cultural and histori­cally significant dressing styles and blend in a part of this heritage with their uniforms. 
<br>
<br><strong>Comfort</strong> gets priority Hotels are also breaking away from the stiff tradition of neck and bow ties, going in for open collars, polo necks, Chinese collars, and so on to bring in the element of comfort in an industry that chips in possibly the longest man-hours on work. Flat, soft, comfortable shoes are preferred instead of completely formal, hard box shoes for employees who are on their feet all day. 
<br>
<br><strong>Flexibility</strong> More pants and skirts options are now available for female employees to choose from. Female front desk employees are starting to don day dresses or skirts with jackets instead of traditional suiting. At many resorts, female hostesses and cocktail servers are embracing retail-inspired garments such as maxi dresses, dresses with higher hemlines and slimmer silhouettes made in body-conscious fabrics, and garments of knitwear fabrics.&nbsp;<br></p>
